
Qlik is directly connected to a mysql database where we have stored our dataset after gathering, processing, and topic analysis. Below is an overview of all the code used for these steps and algorithms that happened OUTSIDE of the Qlik .qvf file to store, update, or add data in mysql.


Getting Book/Movie Pairs
--------------------------
* Scraped Wikipedia pages 
    * Dylan to add scripts
* Scraped ISBNs from book wikipedia pages where possible
    * Dylan or Claudia to add scripts


Book Data Collection
--------------------------
* Signed up for goodreads API key: https://www.goodreads.com/api
* Took Book/Movie pair list from Wikipedia scrape and do a little bit of manual editing on book titles on series that didn't scrape cleanly from 
* Get Goodreads Book IDs: Get_Book_Ids_Mapping_file.ipynb
    * Use data from Book/Movie pair list (isbn, title, author, alternative title) and iterate through the best choices for finding a match to get goodreads id using python script
* Take output of this file (a csv) -include the title/author for the match from goodreads and manually check titles that didn't have an exact match on isbn or title+author and make manual adjustments on goodreads_id column when the match is bad. All done in Excel.
* Input this cleaned up file into scraping script: goodreads_data_collection.py 
    * This script web scrapes Goodreads for data about the book, book genres, and the first 300 reviews for each book (if >300). Note for our scraping, we used a rotating proxy service to ensure the IP would not get blocked but have removed that personal info from the script so if you run this script, should be aware of that risk. The script will take several days to run when used on the full list.
* Send the data to mysql: send_bookdata_to_mysql.ipynb


Movie Data Collection
--------------------------
* Movie TMDb Data API data collection
    * Lauren H scripts to add scripts/any notes on sequence
* Movie IMDB Data (merging tsvs w/ movie list from tmdb)
    * Lauren H to add scripts/any notes on sequence
* IMdb review scraping script
    * Claudia to add scripts/sequence notes


Data Processing 
--------------------------
* Connecting book/movie data: 
    * Script Lauren H used for this
* Genre cleaning/standardization: genre_standardization.ipynbt
* Rating standardization: overallrating_standardize.ipynb
* Review Text Cleaning scripts: 
    * book_review_cleaning2.ipynb and movie_review_cleaning2.ipynb
	* These were used to clean the review text and remove stop words, standardize misspelled words, and lemmatize
* book_review_cleaning_TopA_xT.ipynb, movie_review_cleaning_TopA_xT.ipynb	
	* These are used to clean the text more for the word clouds, includes removing the title of the book/movie to help declutter the cloud.


Text Analysis
--------------------------
*  LDA_with_gensim.ipynb
    *  Used to create several LDA topic models with varying number of topics; Runs coherence on each model to track the best model; Run separately for book reviews and movie reviews
*  Get LDA Stats.ipynb
	*  Get some statistics on the generated topics to compare
*  Assign_Book_Review_Topics.ipynb, Assign_Movie_Review_Topics.ipynb
	*  Take the preferred topic model and assign topics to individual reviews
*  Assign_Book_Topics.ipynb, Assign_Movie_Topics.ipynb
	*  Take the preferred topic model and assign topics to books/movies by combining all the reviews into one “document”
*  Visualization.ipynb, Visualization-Books.ipynb
	*  Use LDAVis to get an interactive visualization of the topics

Do we want to add any of the sentiment code from Lauren L or Lauren H? It didn't end up going in Qlik but we do have some of the visuals in the report
