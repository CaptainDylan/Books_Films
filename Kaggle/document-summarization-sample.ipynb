       "\"It has taken almost seven months for me to read LotR aloud to my two daughters; we felt a sense of achievement and sadness when we finished tonight. The last time I read the novel was just prior to the first of Peter Jackson's films. I did this consciously fearing that after the films the story would never feel the same again. Reading the book aloud made me appreciate Tolkien's love of landscape, trees, plants, gardens, mountains and natural features of all kind. The extensive use of geographic terms was particularly notable. There are many, many memorable moments in the novel but our favourites, in no particular order: meeting Strider in the Prancing Pony; Sam singing 'The Lay of Gilgalad'; Frodo being wounded on Weathertop by the Black Riders; meeting Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli's long journey chasing the orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin; meeting Treebeard; when Gandalf fights the Balrog; and any time Galadriel was present, especially with her mirror. We really liked Faramir but the episode and dialogue with Eowyn was lame. The scouring of the shire seemed more evil than anything else that happened in the novel. This has been the most enjoyable of bedtime treats.\""
