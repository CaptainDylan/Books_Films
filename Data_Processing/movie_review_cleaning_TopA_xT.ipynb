       "      <td>being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards perhaps but it can also be definitive test of ones character if one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends or at very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment it says something about who that person is on other hand if one squanders opportunity on a totally self-absorbed shallow existence it says even more and while taking latter path may provide some interesting moments its a cosmetically created external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life and sooner or later to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence that bubble is bound to burst and when it finally happens when wake-up call comes how one responds to it is ultimate test of character which is what happens to a such a man in  directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ring hugh grant as far as will freeman grant is concerned he has perfect life he lives comfortably if not extravagantly on income provided by a certain kind of inheritance on surface at least hes happy admittedly however hes very epitome of shallow who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all he merely takes from life gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it but of late his relationships have become a bit sticky women are becoming too demanding break-ups too messy he needs a new conquest a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what hes looking for fortuitous however in a way he doesnt realize as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy marcus nicholas hoult and its a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life as marcus becomes catalyst that changes wills entire perspective for first time will begins to question who he is and what hes doing or not doing with his life telling this story adapted for screen by peter hedges and weitz brothers from novel by nick hornby presented a challenge to moviemakers in that its nothing really new history of movie is filled with stories of individual epiphanies many along same lines as this one recently kid with bruce willis for example so a fresh approach and presentation including kind of performances they could extract from their actors was essential for this movie to attain any distinction whatsoever which it does and splendidly and moreover they succeed on all fronts screenplay is intelligent and characters especially will and marcus mom fiona toni collette are convincingly well developed with will there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by end of movie it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is after first establishing ting point from which character can grow same is true of fiona theres detours and set-backs which as in real life prevent a direct journey from point a to point b and create proverbial sticky wicket along way weitz and weitz set a good pace and most importantly manage to give their movie some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic maudlin sentimentality rather sentiments and situations they express are real and believable and presented in such a way as to afford audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate as will hugh grant gives arguably his best performance ever in some respects will is similar to other characters grant has created most notably daniel in bridget joness diary but theres a depth to will hes never previously managed to achieve and without question this is his most three-dimensional fully developed character yet grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here he does an especially nice job of effecting wills transition in very real and credible terms and by end its obvious that this is a side of grant we have not seen before with this role he has effectively expanded his range as an actor in final analysis its a performance with real substance and it makes will a truly memorable character young hoult brings marcus convincingly to life as well with an extremely natural performance in which he commendably manages to avoid trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen some credit must go to his directors of course but its hoult who makes it especially believable in way he responds for instance to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen his rather introspective response to taunts of his school mates for example quite different than what is usually portrayed in movie and in their scenes together grant and hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures overall success of this movie supporting cast includes rachel weisz rachel isabel brook angie sharon small christine victoria smurfit suzie and nat gastiain tena ellie entertaining as well as insightful  gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of human condition that has been explored before but rarely as effectively weitz brothers make subject of their movie accessible to a wide audience and in a way that is engaging and satisfying this movie is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect and thats magic

       "      <td>is a spellbinding ride driven by ultimate larger-than-life character i didnt even know movie invented this dancing style that seemed like belonging to greek traditions since dawn of ages but this is essence of zorba something that feels instantly timeless and universal it is only fitting that most universal and timeless of all hollywood actors would play a guy like zorba anthony quinn isnt just a body but a soul that infuses story with an inspirational lust for life curing any possible flaw because like life movie and story are indeed flawed i suspect  will leave most viewers infuriated and frustrated by plot loose ends and it is to credit of quinns extraordinary performance that when movie comes to an end you just want to put all flaws in a bowl and crash whole thing and dance over shattered pieces yes there is no plot this is all a fraud even good old alexis zorbas is one he pretends to be a good cook miner adviser and womanizer but none of his projects ever succeed yet to call him a loser would be like calling hercules a weakling this is man with a spirit as expansive and large as his physique with a predisposition to embrace people to grab things because what other uses can hands and arms are of his soul is shaped of dionysian hedonism and contagious idealism to which uptight and meek greek-english writing-blocked basil alan bates immediately surrenders theres something just catching with zorbas charisma and if you go to a traditional freak village a company like zorba is more than welcome and alan bates plays a difficult role because hes perfect foil to zorbas extravaganza and exuberance but hes not dull and passive either hes a sponge absorbing much of this lively zest without compromising himself his strength is to stay true to himself and this is why zorba instantly likes him because he knows he can be true to himself as well as fragile as their blooming friendship is at least it is based on sincerity now to story normally goodhearted newcomer changes peoples lives for best and during his journey he picks up a thing or two its called a story a narrative a characters arc and  misleads us to this certitude but this is too smart a plot for such contrivances story embraces soul of greek theater it is a tragicomedy where tragedy upstages comedy many times and two outcast women both prisoners of their troubled pasts wear sad masks madame hortense lila kedrova a french ex-prostitute and local hotel manager who falls for zorbas charm and widow irene papas whos struck by strangers niceness she whos used to be center of male menacing and es including love-stricken village idiot papas performance is antithesis of kedrova kedrova who won oscar for her performance says too much and becomes a childish creature eager to hear whatever can please her papas says nothing but pain is even deeper and her soul harder to reach but that makes her intimate scene with basil even more powerful she might be more vulnerable than hortense after all but we cant tell what is behind basils mind is he infatuated curious or does he just follow zorbas admonition about greatest sin according to god if a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not go zorba follows his own advice and during a special mission to buy furniture for reopening of basils mine he irresponsibly uses his jobs money to have a good time basically mens impulses and weaknesses end up killing two women they pretended to love in a horrific scene widow is beaten to death by a vengeful mob after village idiot committed suicide and has her throat slit to answer for her lost honor madame hortense dies of pneumonia contracted during a rainy improvised wedding and is posthumously victim of black-clad hysterical women who come to steal her belongings like vultures finishing a corpse she doesnt even get a funeral and zorba is powerless even basil couldnt outfight men who killed widow call him a wimp coward or lucid hes just not cut for such a lifestyle portrayal of villagers men and women can strike as violent and too unbelievably archaic but i dont think a greek director could be accused of being biased against his own people mihalis kakogiannis is director and theres something so vibrant in his documentary-like style such a raw energy that it seems to be part of greek genes some parts reminded me of cassavetes movie mostly focused on action graphically sensual and sexually vocal movie was ahead of its time and provocatively unsatisfying as so little has changed in end even when big mine project fails whatever it was this is so relative compared to more tragic losses that all you can do is laugh at them because thats what life is about people try love fail but if in end you dance in a beach with your best friend there might still be hope for human race movie missed a best score nomination for mikis theodorakis although it invented a dance anthony quinn missed oscar despite role of a lifetime mention of his name alone makes this escalating sirtiki tempo resonate in your mind hollywood even believed my fair lady was better picture but all failures are overshadowed by movie real success its inspirational message its hymn for life captured in that ending scene and its infectious urge to dance you know what zorba is my kind of movie whoopa</td>\n",

       "2       this movie is based on harry mulisch novel and both have some distinguishing characteristics that go backon purposeto classic greek tragedy theatre incredible co-incidence that carries story is reminiscent of ancient literary vehicles that carry a story thus you should not look at chance events as being part of story but as being foundation for storythey in themselves should not really be questioned also note that chance meeting is preceded by a meeting with some kind of stone dutch word for dice is dobbelsteen or dicing-stone so that simile of dice and chance can be extended to stones and chance this explains significance of anton meeting his first wife while visiting stone of scones book more strongly than movie is also constructed as a greek tragedy with a prologue five acts and then an epilogue anton steenwijk is also interesting himself he represses events of  but it keeps coming back at him but he is an anaesthetist in more than one wayhe puts his memories to sleep even in final stages when story is alread quite clear to him he uses drugs at his house in tuscany and seeks to ease a toothache in amsterdam before going to ban bomb demonstration personally i think book was translated into a movie in brilliant fashion my major qualm with it is mediocrity of sound and sound effects some pretty good acting and a fantastic storyline make this one well worth

       "4       warning within i first became familiar with  through club in package with my book was a slim volume that i hadnt ordered i suppose they were clearing out warehouse and a copy of  got tossed into my order as a freebie it sat around ignored for a months and then one afternoon i got bored and needed something to read wow straight through in one sitting some time later with no advertising or promotion of any kind  showed up in a local theater because of total lack of promotion this movie is probably greatest sleeper of decade it probably only played in us at art houses and a very small number of other theaters anyone who has encountered work of satre or camus will find themselves right at home with this movie its deep involved and engrossing it shows that no one no matter how close they are to an event knows everything about it young anton steenwjik is sole survivor of brutal murder of his entire family by german troops and burning of his home in occupied holland troops did it as retribution for a killing of a collaborator carried out by local dutch underground resistance cell in front of steenwjik home anton was there and he saw it all but it takes a 20 year odyssey that stretches across most of northern europe for him to learn whole truth about that night and its horrendous events therein lies tale and its a tale thats well worth watch even tho i promised in this i will not give you big one most unexpected and ironic gotcha ive ever seen in a movie a very highly recommended movie if you get chance see it im updating my comments after fact i recently saw videotape version of movie and found myself somewhat disappointed nay outraged by it in an attempt to trim movie to fit on standard length tape stock i suppose vhs videotape version makes a cut which for me is fatal they cut entire end of antons chance meeting with fake ploogs son that 30 second or so edit completely changes feeling and meaning of entire sequence completely destroying delicate balance that director put into theatrical release version if anyone read this who is involved with a possible future dvd release of  i beg of you please no editing this movie is carefully put together like a fine watch if you remove anything its not going to work right

       "5       what is really fascinating in this dutch movie is way past takes shape again little by little on a very long period hero is a middle-age man when he finally learns final truth what is less convincing in implausibility of situations and main flaw of work each time a new character appears outside of course of two wives his only purpose is to provide hero with new facts about tragedy he went through when he was 12 and however story is absorbing first scenes during fateful night are harrowing first in parents house or in icy landscape that surrounds it or in dungeon where young boy meets female resistance fighter then begins childs adult life and while there are very strong scenes there are also some flaws too much voice-over he spends his easter holiday in london he gets married are completely pointless picture is enough and its really difficult to follow heros psychological change why for instance does he get divorce but its questionings who are heroes who are traitors sometimes recalls jorge luis borges one of best scenes shows anton talking with collaborators son who is victim now did this young man and his mother deserve what happened to them they re living replies anton and is antons attitude -stay away from events that shakes worlso worthwhile thats why scene is very revealing finally he understood that responsibility is everywhere and should be shared by everyone in spite of its flaws its certainly one of most interesting european movies of eighties

       "7       dutch are not great at making movies but when they make a ww ii movie it often is a little masterpiece de aanslag is a movie like this de aanslag isnt necessarily about ww ii but more about effects of it on a persons life and why things happen way they do and how little things can effect a persons life for ever most of movies story is set in years after ww ii and uses flashbacks of things that happened in ww ii to make more things clear and to show things from a different perspective from different individuals that were involved in incident were movie is about it becomes more and more clear what happened at night that collaborator ploeg was killed but dutch resistance and more importantly why things happened way it happened story also shows a detailed view of netherlands and their citizens years and decades after ww ii and how it still affected many there are many great returning characters in story and acting is for especially dutch standards pretty high derek de lint who now is better know world wide for his role as derek rayne in poltergeist legacy is a great leading man that really carries movie cinematography from theo van de sande who later did cinematography for movie hit blade is great and sets a nice mood directing by fons readmakers is done wonderfully and it never makes movie hard to follow even though at times it gets a bit complicated great dutch oscar winning drama with some memorable moments and a fantastic ending were everything comes together and gets clear http bobafett blogspot com

       "8       my family is from haarlem and i feel very close to places scenes characters and atmosphere that movie generates fact that there are only a view productions regarding dutch resistance is very sad to me as dutch resistance was on of best organized during german occupation however man that was shot dead outside anton steenwijks house was an nsb participant he belonged to dutch nazi party as previously stated by some people in this thread he was not a german nazi but a dutch collaborator a lot of my family were in resistance during nazi occupation some of them were shut by germans in dunes near bloemendaal a zee site of ere begraaf plaats where anton takes his daughter to find truus kosters grave in latter end of movie when i was young we often spend time there to visit friends and family that were executed during those troublesome years i dearly love this movie and would recommend it to anyone

       "12      movie and book are really very much same here i read book first and then watch movie and i have really not much to say about both they are both of same quality for both book and movie feature same amount of accidental meetings which are after a while quite unbelievable and that is all criticism i have movie has of course certain things which are better than book for instance it is more exciting but then again movie also has its downsides for sometimes acting is not that great but overall better and worse things level each other out so my verdicts for book and movie are same pretty good if you like mulischs books and are interested in world war read de zaak out of 10

       "14      i think i smiled all way through  a comic near-masterpiece derived from best-selling novel by nick hornby for sake of accuracy both novel and movie should more rightly be titled about two boys since story focuses not only on 12-year old marcus but on 38-year old will a man totally dedicated to proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island thank you very much wills island is his own london flat which he has equipped with all accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology in form of computers big screen tvs and dvd playerscan afford who needs people when you have so much stuff to keep you content and occupied will thrives in his environment much to chagrin of his married couple friends who keep insisting that he must certainly be miserable without a wife and family to give his life meaning but will loves being shallow a fact of his personality he is more than willing to declare right up front and thing he needs or thinks he needs is people to clutter it up yet island dwellers have a tendency not to remain marooned for long and before he knows it will finds himself striking up a relationship with a lonely backward boy named marcus whose mother suffers from serious bouts of suicidal depression more than any comedy in recent memory  establishes a tone and sticks with it to end screenplay by peter hedges chris weitz and paul weitz latter two function as movie directors as well manages to take a potentially clichd and predictable story and invest it with a warmth wit and tenderness that are all-enveloping voice-over narration by both will and marcus which introduces us to their characters and keeps us informed as to their mental progress throughout movie is remarkably clever and droll yet characters never come across as smug smart-alecky or flippant rather they speak and behave in ways that are both believable and realistic hugh grant gives his richest performance to date as will man who refuses to grow up and assume role of responsible adult blithely unaware of emotional depths that lie hidden under a surface of apathy and indifference superb grant is more than matched by relative newcomer nicholas hoult an extraordinarily gifted young actor who doesnt look like average adorable screen kid and who makes marcus into a very real very likable and very sensitive young man remainder of large cast is outstanding as well moreover movie is very astute in its observation about just how easy technology has made it for us to isolate ourselves from one another admittedly a little of sharpness does go out of screenplay in its closing stretches but not enough to diminish ones pleasure appreciably in many ways  is a movie that needs to be experienced first hand since mere words fail to convey very special charm and spell it manages to cast over viewer rush to see it comic gems like this one dont come around very often

       "15      being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards perhaps but it can also be definitive test of ones character if one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends or at very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment it says something about who that person is on other hand if one squanders opportunity on a totally self-absorbed shallow existence it says even more and while taking latter path may provide some interesting moments its a cosmetically created external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life and sooner or later to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence that bubble is bound to burst and when it finally happens when wake-up call comes how one responds to it is ultimate test of character which is what happens to a such a man in  directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ring hugh grant as far as will freeman grant is concerned he has perfect life he lives comfortably if not extravagantly on income provided by a certain kind of inheritance on surface at least hes happy admittedly however hes very epitome of shallow who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all he merely takes from life gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it but of late his relationships have become a bit sticky women are becoming too demanding break-ups too messy he needs a new conquest a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what hes looking for fortuitous however in a way he doesnt realize as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy marcus nicholas hoult and its a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life as marcus becomes catalyst that changes wills entire perspective for first time will begins to question who he is and what hes doing or not doing with his life telling this story adapted for screen by peter hedges and weitz brothers from novel by nick hornby presented a challenge to moviemakers in that its nothing really new history of movie is filled with stories of individual epiphanies many along same lines as this one recently kid with bruce willis for example so a fresh approach and presentation including kind of performances they could extract from their actors was essential for this movie to attain any distinction whatsoever which it does and splendidly and moreover they succeed on all fronts screenplay is intelligent and characters especially will and marcus mom fiona toni collette are convincingly well developed with will there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by end of movie it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is after first establishing ting point from which character can grow same is true of fiona theres detours and set-backs which as in real life prevent a direct journey from point a to point b and create proverbial sticky wicket along way weitz and weitz set a good pace and most importantly manage to give their movie some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic maudlin sentimentality rather sentiments and situations they express are real and believable and presented in such a way as to afford audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate as will hugh grant gives arguably his best performance ever in some respects will is similar to other characters grant has created most notably daniel in bridget joness diary but theres a depth to will hes never previously managed to achieve and without question this is his most three-dimensional fully developed character yet grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here he does an especially nice job of effecting wills transition in very real and credible terms and by end its obvious that this is a side of grant we have not seen before with this role he has effectively expanded his range as an actor in final analysis its a performance with real substance and it makes will a truly memorable character young hoult brings marcus convincingly to life as well with an extremely natural performance in which he commendably manages to avoid trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen some credit must go to his directors of course but its hoult who makes it especially believable in way he responds for instance to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen his rather introspective response to taunts of his school mates for example quite different than what is usually portrayed in movie and in their scenes together grant and hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures overall success of this movie supporting cast includes rachel weisz rachel isabel brook angie sharon small christine victoria smurfit suzie and nat gastiain tena ellie entertaining as well as insightful  gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of human condition that has been explored before but rarely as effectively weitz brothers make subject of their movie accessible to a wide audience and in a way that is engaging and satisfying this movie is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect and thats magic of movies    \n",
       "16      in wonderfully entertaining  hugh grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in four weddings and a funeral floppy hair stuttering etc and ends up giving his best performance to date he plays will a wealthy happily unemployed commitment-phobic cad slightly less insidious than daniel cleaver of bridget joness diary whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump however he meets marcus nicholas hoult son of a somewhat suicidal mother toni colette and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly this movie was based on nick hornbys wonderful book of same name and retains much of wit and touching humor early scenes depicting wills full but spiritually empty life are particularly amusing with will dividing day up into units of time and spending units on web-based research finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops exercise shooting pool grooming and like grant makes his character irresponsible but remains enormously likable throughout movie this is important because t to identify with him and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality his mannerismsgrants specialty i thinkare v entertaining to watch selfishness hurt anger recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly other cast members nicholas hoult toni colette and rachel weisz are also v good in their supporting roles and play off each other well movie doesnt follow book too closely however but does one-up on book by wisely emphasizing some parts that book downplays for example rachel played by rachel weisz only appears for a in book but has much more presence in movie through rachel character we see how wills relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones and we realize that he is growing up also movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp witty dialogue that never feels forced movie also employs voice-over function wills very nicely for example in one serious scene will follows ambulance to hospital looking rather serious but in his voice-over he says it was all terrible just terrible but driving fast behind ambulance was fantastic character would never say that out loud but it provides comic relief and assurance that he is indeed very shallow strength of  is in simplicity and power of its scenes not one scene is wasted each one tells us a wealth about characters and leads to wills self-discovery that along with hugh grants delightful performance and backed by a great score from badly drawn boy make  one of most delightful entertaining and touching movies ive seen its a great feel-good movie highly recommended especially to hugh grant fans or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with will and

       "17      sometimes a rut can feel like a hammock when we get stuck in one  is about a londoner who was apparently born into one imprisoned as it were by his fathers legacy as author of one of worlds most popular and annoying christmas songs after years of feckless unemployed upper-middle-class living will views himself as an island and sees his lack of long-term relationships as a plus even offered simple honor of being an infants godfather will begs off saying hed be crap at it and probably just try and shag girl moment she turned 18 i always thought you had hidden depths mother says no youve always had that wrong will cheerfully replies i really am this shallow but of course will does have depths and as played by hugh grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previously-unguessed-at depths of his own we find ourselves rooting for will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12-year-old named marcus played with welcome non-cuteness by nicholas hoult marcus an abuse magnet at school is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal will a 12-year-old at heart is a perfect if unknowing candidate based on great nick hornby novel  walks a fine line doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease like hornbys book movie depicts wills perverse detachment from world as both delightful and pathetic life is a full plate of pain for those who participate but benefits as marcus tries to tell will beat all else of course most of us dont have luxury for island living and potential of resenting will especially as played by that handsome devil grant might have been movie biggest danger but grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on smugness and draws on lost boy within for example when will tries to infiltrate a single-mothers club as a way of bagging some commitment-free sex we watch him tell mothers about his own non-existent two-year-old boy ned telling him you hang in there dad then reacting with uncertain fear when mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child but we also see pain will pretends isnt there in brief flashes as he reflects on hard-drinking failure his father became after his one-hit wonder and especially in one great scene where will finds himself with a woman he really cares about unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment during that scene and a later angry one with marcus grants acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy directors chris and paul weitz of american pie -fame prove they can make a movie that delivers intelligence as well as laughter and with writer peter hedges fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with hornbys solid story i especially liked one near end of movie but if i revealed anything id probably get some flack for it so say no more very scene of movie is a mistake though kind of tidy resolution hornbys novel and life itself rightly rejects its one bum note in this movie but enough of one to dock it a point with me otherwise id have to rate this above even other cinematic hornby adaptation classic high fidelity but this is a very entertaining movie with great set design a terrific rubber soul -style britpop title song by badly drawn boy tight editing and subtle crafty camera work also some great supporting performances especially toni collette as marcus mother who has movie toughest role she must be funny and suicidal and manages to not only pull it off but gives  a wonderfully unstable center as  makes clear instability is a good thing when it shakes us from our ruts

       "18      this movie really came as a surprise to me i had read book shortly before i saw it and when i heard hugh grant was going and weitz brothers were chosen to direct i didnt exactly have high hopes i thought american pie was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature someone clever this movie however turned out to be all that mature clever witty sensible honest and most of all really funny in such a natural way hugh grant has never been better in any role before or since and soundtrack by badly drawn boy is just perfect for movie only thing they overdid a little was toni collettes character ive never seen a person like that in real life what i did like was way they changed ending for movie usually thats not a good idea but it totally worked here after all i still liked high fidelity a tiny bit better movie not book but  comes very close if you are just as much a fan of this book movie as i am get dvd there are wonderful deleted scenes on it which are as funny as rest of movie

       "19        was being touted as a great make over for hugh grant and it is gone is his infamous bumbling english fop role his fluffy hair lost to a sharp more stylish cut here he plays a rich selfish layabout will who cruises through life on royalties from a song his deceased father penned years ago he finds a great way to meet women who dont want to get involved through a single mothers group which is where he meets strange twelve year old boy marcus nicholas hoult who lives with his depressed suicidal mother fiona toni collette a tragic event sees marcus seeking comfort with indifferent will who begins to realise that theres more to life than sitting around at home all day hugh grant is on peak form here he sheds his old roles for that of a fresher younger man he is able to convey charm and selfishness not just through words but also through his mannerisms he even conveys genuine affable warmth later on in movie without making my teeth grate equally impressive is toni collette as marcus sad mother her character has a tragic feeling to it a real sense of world-weariness conveyed in a great combination of makeup and acting of movie for mis nicholas hoult as young boy who helps will come to realizations about his life he doesnt get by on cute good looks like far too many kid actors because he can actually act from innocence of a child when he tries to get his mother and will together to simplistic musings of children who cant understand why some people hurt such as his mother like osment whom he amusing compares himself to hoult shows that child actors are just as if not more so capable as their elders script of movie is witty without being outright hilarious its what you come to expect of british comedy market weak ali g indahouse aside it being a british comedy you can predict where its going to go and there are relatively surprises along way having said that characters are sketched strongly enough and humour at a high enough level that youll be more than entertained along way its surprising to see that this movie was directed by american pie weitz brothers because they bring a thoughtful contemplative air to movie while never getting bogged down in pointless camera techniques most were left with is some simple screen wipes theyve also chosen well by having badly drawn boy compose whole soundtrack as it works very well with movie tone theres nothing outstanding in  but whats here is done surprisingly well its a nice movie thats quite enjoyable for relaxing to some evening a seems just

       "22      i was a bit scared about what kind of treatment chris and paul weitz had given great novel by nick hornby i have to report they did a great job in bringing it to screen with help of screenwriter peter hedges iii its amazing what they have accomplished in translating book to screen and not lose focus in doing so a great many hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this movie hugh grant strikes right amount of hipness confusion and complete lack of responsibility in his interpretation of will he is an actor that brings right attitude in playing a man about london looking for women no matter where hes a prowler looking for women who will fall prey to his charms mr grant is just perfect for this role biggest surprise though was amazing debut of nicholas hoult who just bowled us over as marcus boy of title this young actor has a great career ahead of him if people behind him will steer him into right vehicles because he is a natural he gives mr grant a run for his money chemistry of their time together on screen is basically what was on book while we were read it toni collette plays another mother again her interpretation of fiona was on target rachel weisz adds beauty to movie as rachel someone should take a good look at this gorgeous woman and perhaps give her and hugh grant another vehicle where they can shine once again

       "24      selfish self-centered rich kid will freeman lives alone as an island in london living off royalties from his fathers record when a new dating trick sees him targeting single mothers because they are easier to dump he unwittingly gets mixed up with marcus marcus is a 12 year old who is bullied at school because of his hippy life style forced on him by his mother and struggles at home with his depressed suicidal mother at first he sees himself helping his mum by getting will to like her but gradually marcus and will get used to each other and have lessons that both can learn following steaming success of high fidelity another hornby book makes transition however credit should be given for setting movie in england and not moving it somewhere else cooler this however is probably due to lead being english and very bankable story is of course about blokes and blokes problems this is hornby after all plot is simple but fact that it done with a great deal of wit makes it come across very easily occasionally mix of heavy subjects marcuss home life with comedy of wills life is a little uneasy but after a while it mixes better story is pretty revealing i can see a lot of myself in will as many men will and it is involving then to see marcus teach him things about life however saying that best thing about this is comedy when will is involved it is nearly always laugh out loud funny and thats most of time directors deal with this movie really well they focus on grants strengths and also use several really cool visual things to add to comedy like quick cuts and freeze frame but not to point of annoyance surprising that guys did american pie not most subtle or clever of comedies grant is excellent here he easily handles emotional side of movie and comedy but its in comedy he excels his face plays out as many jokes as his words and he is indeed a master at playing this character however here he has to work harder than when he does his usual english-fop stuff because will is selfish and not immediately likeable i must admit that at t i struggled to get into movie because i hate people who spend their time in notting hill cafes living off inheritances etc so its a credit to grant that he carries it off hoult is not as good he has too much weight to carry hoult has to manage whole emotional side of movie and at times he cant convince collette is good as fiona but again suffers from not having any of comedy side of movie rachel weisz was good in a small role but as far as im concerned if she was making this then she wasnt making another rubbish mummy movie overall this is a successful adaptation of book emotional side and comedy at times dont sit well together and at times it all feels very lightweight but ultimately it all comes together grant is excellent and excels himself here when hes on screen movie is hilarious and moves fluidly unfortunately it slightly highlights weaknesses of those around him

       "27      weitz brothers of american pie fame surprised me with this intelligent comedy they do a commendable job of bringing nick hornbys modern british comedy to screen peter hedges takes up challenge to adapt hornbys novel and he does a fine job i liked that it wasnt americanized quirkiness and humour is well balanced witty and clever while amusing movie is mainly about growth of characters especially will fiona and marcus and i loved how it was portrayed in a gradually subtle way situations are easy to relate to even though characters live under unusual circumstances like will choosing not to work because he does not need to suicidal fiona or marcus regularly visiting will in order to fix him up with his mom they are easy to identify with hugh grant is great as shallow will hes cast against type and this is perhaps role that allows him to stretch his acting further nicholas hoult delivers a natural performance hes certainly not those movie kids who are made to look cute because director cant get them to act so credit does go to weitzs toni collette is superb as always rachel weisz makes best of a small role rest of cast do a good enough job soundtrack is gentle and whimsical at times flowing smoothly with steady pace i liked songs of badly drawn boy some of deleted scenes on dvd are worth a watch in a nutshell  is a simple delightful and funny movie about

       "28      this adaptation by brothers weitz of nick horny novel of same name is a very refreshing comedy-drama that successfully uses a double voice-over narration one of a man who hasnt quite grown up grant and other of a boy who has to grow up too quickly hoult toni collette received several nominations for her supporting role but substance of her character is not quite apparent while rachel weiszs subplot comes together and undone a little too easily if this movie were set during like it was in book overall story would have had more significance still while a little too modern for its own good  is undeniably entertaining and even ugh a little cute and without a doubt worth remembering out of four

       "29       is a charming comedy and a little romance which shows a sweet story played out excellently with some great acting from best when it comes to this type of movie and also many great contributing factors this is one big movie which really is excellent script is tight direction superb and even setting is good too make this in my opinion a just about great movie and one that even has room to grow story is one that can touch heart yet also find your funny bone and by end you should feel well very pleasant it is well timed all way through and when romantic areas are explored it holds its ground making this better than majority of romcoms out there i felt it could have been maybe slightly more laugh out loud but in any case it makes you giggle hugh grant is excellent in lead role and his relationship with nicholas holt is one to be savoured for future generation of movie lovers going on to holt well his talent is plainly seen not best actor here but his work with grant makes both of them shine so much that awards could have been won big time people like toni collette and rachel weisz pitch in perfectly and they dont go understated when your done here many say this is one movie which eclipses its novel that its based on and you can see why with such a strong script adapted beautifully and given so much rich depth that you finish movie feeling youve seen best of british movie i think chris and paul weitz do a good job in directing and are part of reason why grant and holt work so well two seem to be able to mould them to each other and get best out of them i think main negativity comes from well very little yes it lacks substantial comedy but then again when are many movie like this crying with laughter affairs i felt nicholas holt can be poor yes i know hes a child actor i just felt he can seem to much like he is being directed and not portraying his true quality as an actor but other than that very little is wrong with movie if you like good old romps and a fun old adventure then this is for you as it really spans over a good year to show you truly everything about each main characters life if your looking to be heart wrenched well i dont think it will make you cry but no doubt it has its sadder moment but in any case tissues should not be needed whilst viewing overall i think it was just about an excellent comedy and one that will be remembered for a long time chemistry of leads is truly stand out point from this movie and without not just characters but two actors this would have been greatly at a disadvantage love it or hate it and it be slightly soppy this movie is sure to have some feeling warm and fuzzy but i accept some others will feel slightly more not annoyed but maybe cheesy seeing as majority of this movie is very one liner orientated but they all come out well

       "275144  with rave reviews and a cast which includes anthony quinn as zorba alan bates as basil irene papas as widow featuring lila kedrova as madame hortense as well as other greek actors and people of crete viewer would think theyre in for a real treat from opening scenes entire story makes little sense a shy and reserved englishman on his way to crete to claim a mine he inherited meets an older unkempt seemingly poor and boisterous man named zorba who claims all manner of talent from cook to miner zorba is basils opposite and he hires him but exactly why he hired him is anyones guess and left to viewers imagination as we begin to meet inhabitants of village including widow rarely speaks and madame hortense who never seems to stop speaking we begin to be absorbed into a world of bizarre people and odd events that dont connect and make little sense i think its worth seeing because of its strangeness i cannot say more lest i give whatever plot there is away

       "275145  anthony quinn really makes nikos kazantzakis character of zorba come to life turning in a fantastic performance and conveying zorbas philosophy of living life to full of dancing and laughing in not just moments of joy or success but also those of tragedy or failure book is a masterpiece and while movie doesnt or perhaps cant get quite as deep michael cacoyannis producer director screenwriter certainly does it justice shooting on location in crete capturing beautiful images and an authenticity in his movie and letting quinn shine were given a wonderful philosophy in this gruff character who eschews pretense book learning rational analysis religion and nationalism he is at once both hedonistic and simple and also profound and deep having gone beyond all theories and frameworks while living his life with a kind of purity zorba grabs us from beginning asking an englishman alan bates will no man ever do something without a why just like that for hell of it as they await their ferry and then quickly sizing him up by saying you think too much that is your trouble clever people and grocers they weigh everything there is a challenge to rationality and convention here and while englishman hires zorba its clear that zorba will be one doing mentoring on how to live a part of this is in nudging him into pursuing women which zorba does with relish aside from his ribald moments there are others which are pretty risqu including an old widow lila kedrova recalling an evening she spent with four admirals and making it clear they all had sex together after a champagne bath there are two very disturbing scenes in movie one of which is when a young woman irene papas a man has killed himself over is surrounded by townsfolk stoned and then killed its truly horrifying and even if we can accept it as an honest portrayal of old-world culture though shes not guilty of anything fact that her death means nothing to two principal characters englishman especially doesnt seem genuine regardless its very difficult to watch later instant an old woman dies her home is ransacked and looted in another ugly mob scene its as if cacoyannis is emphasizing how primitive crete is and juxtaposing this with zorbas primitive though enlightened philosophy this is consistent with kazantzakis writing in novel as well as in freedom or death there is a ruggedness in people as rugged as crete itself and if youre sensitive to that or behavior which is far from politically correct you may not like movie as much a couple more quotes on aging they say that age kills fire inside of a man that he hears death coming he opens door and says come in give me rest that is a pack of old damn lies ive got enough fight in me to devour world so i fight on being irrational a man needs a little madness or else he never dares cut rope and be free on war i have done things for my country that would make your hair stand i have killed burned villages raped women and why because they were turks or bulgarians thats rotten damn fool i was now i look at a man any man and i say he is good he is bad what do i care if hes greek or turk as i get older i swear by bread i eat i even stop asking that good or bad what is difference they all end up same way food for worms

       "275147  in  its same old adage of foreigners who are uncouth sloppy dumb violent and ruled by lust its familiar case of young uptight person learning how to really live by an earthy coarse mentor except it isnt no matter how many times weve heard this story before when we watch  somehow its different alan bates serves as young uptight person who doesnt really know how to live and since hes so young and handsome audience has no problem putting themselves in his place-thats really point in types of stories for audience to learn mentors lessons not character he goes to greece and is somewhat enchanted somewhat repelled by different culture theres a healthy amount of stereotypes present in movie that might come across as offensive but somehow black-and-white quaint archaic quality of movie unites all elements and makes us think its just a slice of past rather than a regular foreign people are slobs movie zorba is anthony quinns most famous role tour-de-force everyone references and tries to emulate even if they dont really know who anthony quinn is warmth wisdom freedom love acceptance and of course dance are all classic anthony quinn traits and therefore zorba traits academy in its infinite wisdom awarded tony oscars for roles he never should have even been nominated for and when he gave a tour-de-force performance he was snubbed  was only time he was nominated for best actor but its my sneaking suspicion that academy used tony as their token ethnic winner they gave him two awards for supporting roles letting him know his place and refused to give him an award for a leading role  is type of movie you watch and say of course he won oscar for this and in fact some people think he did win for it beaten out by possibly least deserving oscar-winning performance of all time rex harrison in my fair lady anthony quinns quintessential performance is a favorite among fans and even non-fans its just impossible not to like him when you watch this movie hes so full of love life and love of life this highly successful movie was nominated for seven academy awards and took home three although for life of me i cant understand why lila kedrova was even nominated let alone won ironically incredibly famous music by mikis theodorakis thats spoofed and repeated as often as zorba dance was not nominated for an oscar if youve never seen this classic rent it this weekend pick out a nice bottle of wine and put together a little picnic of cheeses meats bread and of course olives movie was movieed on location and youll feel like youre really there

       "275148  this is a curious and strange movie there is something sparse and barren about it and all hype about its life affirming leave a things to be desired that being said it cannot be denied that in end it does affirm demonstrable fact that life will go on and shuffle its way through all pathos and bathos and pathetic misery and tragedy and ridiculous hilarious comedy of its errors and even here and there step lively to a simple tune perhaps it is very meanness of this greek environs that serves to highlight fact that life in end is what you make and not other way around there is no use in pretending that quinn does not dominate frame he is in and even seems to be hovering over frames he is not in with regard to this movie as alexis zorbas lovable womanizing rogue now engaged in a peripatetic discussion of all things animal vegetable and mineral with a young english intellectual played by alan bates named basil quinn seems to justify lofty aims of movie even when mean spirited surrounding characters act to suggest otherwise zorba here of course is meant to represent soul and to some degree national character of greek people best and worst aspects of that character in constant interplay quinn never misses a beat representing this he towers over story like some kind of greek paul bunyan or pecos bill which is exactly what nikos kazantzakis had in mind in much deeper and more probing novel on which this movie is based i have read other reviews about this movie and several reviewers before me made some excellent points they are correct representation of women here leaves a lot to be desired artistic sensibility of quinns zorba can easily be interpreted as tricks of a confidence artist more interested in seducing women than in promoting business interests of his boss but thumbnail analyses beggar point zorba is a hard worker who simply falls prey to his own passions more often than not he is a fighter and a lover too involved with real life to sequester himself in intellectual abstraction and introversion that is proving such a prison for his young friend read dantes divine comedy irene papas smolders as earthy greek widow who encounters alan bates intellectual engaging in a lovers tryst with him that results in tragic consequences for her lila kedrova shines as madame hortense whom zorba wines and dines and promises love while running off to embroil himself in further adventures afar she accomplishes a performance that is heartfelt and touching and elegiac and fully deserving of an oscar win mikis theodorakis score is as magical as quinns looming iconic presence and minor characters often seem like black and white photographs out of life magazine however for all bombast of music promising great and triumphant things this movie leaves you with a wry smile here and there zorba for all his splendiferous declaiming and passionate outbursts in end makes nothing work in a lasting way or saves anyone or anything except lamb roasting on spit while it may not be true that he simply shrugs and walks or dances away for it becomes obvious that he feels things deeply perhaps to a fault it is true that his particular tragedy is that for all his great energy and enthusiasm he is still a victim of his own cultural conditioning and social education he comes across as ironically being just as trapped in his greekness as alan bates is in his books three questions occurred to me after read comments of other reviewers what if zorba had somehow made lignite mine work and turn a profit what if zorba and young intellectual had somehow saved widows life what if zorba had thoroughly tested his logging contraption until he himself knew and could demonstrate it would be successful one could also add a sugarcoated ending for madame hortense and her home but perhaps that would be going too far all i know is that when i played various versions of zorba theme listed on youtube and got up next morning members of my family seemed energized and smiling there must be something to this

       "275149    is a spellbinding ride driven by ultimate larger-than-life character i didnt even know movie invented this dancing style that seemed like belonging to greek traditions since dawn of ages but this is essence of zorba something that feels instantly timeless and universal it is only fitting that most universal and timeless of all hollywood actors would play a guy like zorba anthony quinn isnt just a body but a soul that infuses story with an inspirational lust for life curing any possible flaw because like life movie and story are indeed flawed i suspect  will leave most viewers infuriated and frustrated by plot loose ends and it is to credit of quinns extraordinary performance that when movie comes to an end you just want to put all flaws in a bowl and crash whole thing and dance over shattered pieces yes there is no plot this is all a fraud even good old alexis zorbas is one he pretends to be a good cook miner adviser and womanizer but none of his projects ever succeed yet to call him a loser would be like calling hercules a weakling this is man with a spirit as expansive and large as his physique with a predisposition to embrace people to grab things because what other uses can hands and arms are of his soul is shaped of dionysian hedonism and contagious idealism to which uptight and meek greek-english writing-blocked basil alan bates immediately surrenders theres something just catching with zorbas charisma and if you go to a traditional freak village a company like zorba is more than welcome and alan bates plays a difficult role because hes perfect foil to zorbas extravaganza and exuberance but hes not dull and passive either hes a sponge absorbing much of this lively zest without compromising himself his strength is to stay true to himself and this is why zorba instantly likes him because he knows he can be true to himself as well as fragile as their blooming friendship is at least it is based on sincerity now to story normally goodhearted newcomer changes peoples lives for best and during his journey he picks up a thing or two its called a story a narrative a characters arc and  misleads us to this certitude but this is too smart a plot for such contrivances story embraces soul of greek theater it is a tragicomedy where tragedy upstages comedy many times and two outcast women both prisoners of their troubled pasts wear sad masks madame hortense lila kedrova a french ex-prostitute and local hotel manager who falls for zorbas charm and widow irene papas whos struck by strangers niceness she whos used to be center of male menacing and es including love-stricken village idiot papas performance is antithesis of kedrova kedrova who won oscar for her performance says too much and becomes a childish creature eager to hear whatever can please her papas says nothing but pain is even deeper and her soul harder to reach but that makes her intimate scene with basil even more powerful she might be more vulnerable than hortense after all but we cant tell what is behind basils mind is he infatuated curious or does he just follow zorbas admonition about greatest sin according to god if a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not go zorba follows his own advice and during a special mission to buy furniture for reopening of basils mine he irresponsibly uses his jobs money to have a good time basically mens impulses and weaknesses end up killing two women they pretended to love in a horrific scene widow is beaten to death by a vengeful mob after village idiot committed suicide and has her throat slit to answer for her lost honor madame hortense dies of pneumonia contracted during a rainy improvised wedding and is posthumously victim of black-clad hysterical women who come to steal her belongings like vultures finishing a corpse she doesnt even get a funeral and zorba is powerless even basil couldnt outfight men who killed widow call him a wimp coward or lucid hes just not cut for such a lifestyle portrayal of villagers men and women can strike as violent and too unbelievably archaic but i dont think a greek director could be accused of being biased against his own people mihalis kakogiannis is director and theres something so vibrant in his documentary-like style such a raw energy that it seems to be part of greek genes some parts reminded me of cassavetes movie mostly focused on action graphically sensual and sexually vocal movie was ahead of its time and provocatively unsatisfying as so little has changed in end even when big mine project fails whatever it was this is so relative compared to more tragic losses that all you can do is laugh at them because thats what life is about people try love fail but if in end you dance in a beach with your best friend there might still be hope for human race movie missed a best score nomination for mikis theodorakis although it invented a dance anthony quinn missed oscar despite role of a lifetime mention of his name alone makes this escalating sirtiki tempo resonate in your mind hollywood even believed my fair lady was better picture but all failures are overshadowed by movie real success its inspirational message its hymn for life captured in that ending scene and its infectious urge to dance you know what zorba is my kind of movie whoopa

       "275150  this is a great movie and especially anthony quinns performance is so inspiring only reason i didnt rate it a 10 is because i urge people to read bookwhich is a 10 seriously  is in my opinion one of greatest books ever written i have read it several times and years i read it again especially if i travel to greece it has such an abundance of wisdom energy love of life unforgettable

       "275152  let us now praise big performances and actors who dare to put them on screen charles laughton orson welles bette davis risk-takers who sometimes fail but more often than not succeed much more satisfying to watch than ever-increasing number of dare-nothings whose skills have been forged on tv soaps or by modelling knitwear here we have three very different actors taking those risks under aegis of a first-rate writer-director mihalis kakogiannis first anthony quinn in title role who apparently was giving such an over-top performance that mr kakogiannis was concerned hed have to rein him in to what extent he did so i dont know but result is quinns brave multi-layered superbly wrought characterization next irene papas who brings all her skills as a tragedienne to a role with lines of dialogue everything has to be expressed in her gestures her face her eyes sheer intensity of ms papas furnace of passion that powers her through movie takes your breath away finally lila kedrova who won a thoroughly deserved oscar for her role as a vulnerable care-worn french woman with a huge heart what we have here is a performance of utter fearlessness ranging from broad comedy to heart-rending pathos and emotions change in a flash that is what is so remarkable about ms kedrova she gives pretty much same performance in hitchcocks topaz it may well be she gives same performance in everything she ever did doesnt matter its worth watch it is drawn from a deep well of emotion filtered through a considerable technical imagination an extraordinary tightrope-walk between pillars of sincerity and artifice against three titans a somewhat miscast alan bates does as well as he can bates played a wide variety of roles in his distinguished career and in most he was unbeatable a kind of loving go-between mayor of casterbridge an englishman abroad to name just four of many but he also could struggle a bit when fit was not perfect and here as in georgy girl he isnt quite right not believably upper-class donnish story zorba tells gives its two remarkable female characters a tough time whether this was intended as a critique of misogyny of cretan peasant society of time or simply a reflection of it is difficult to say what is shocking is that fate ms papas character endures is one that is still common in parts of world today  is beautifully movieed and edited

       "275157  this movie is about two sociopaths one is a tight-ass and other is reckless in end they dance together not for regret of all horror that went over their heads but because life is something they want to enjoy no matter how bad it gets one critic of this movie noted surreal horror it is not believable that people of even most primitive societies would conspire to murder an innocent woman nor rob a person of their possessions while dying nonetheless i suspended my disbelieve and really felt that crete should be nuked to stone age it got to me note also that there are only two women in this movie worthy of a look there are lots of young unemployed men but all of women are very old and are worse than wicked witch of west what happened to young women in this village did they all go way of widow one might wonder where stephen king could have gone with this still i sometimes enjoy movie like this

       "275160  ts out like a comedy sort of an odd couple thing then you realize that two are friends and they love each other and then all this depressing tragic stuff happens where movie deals with death and living and seizing day etc quinn and bates are great heck everyone is great in this a lot of story is rather difficult to understand like why villagers act that way who that old guy is i guess hes father of suicide boy and why couldnt alan bates help that girl that he loved when she needed him most hmmm and i wasnt exactly sure about how zorba felt about hortense but anyway theres tons of laughs as well as some disturbing death scenes that left me hating villagers to bits but ending is truly excellent as good as shawshank redemption its just perfect so youll leave smiling just as two guys in movie did yippeee its worth seeing for sure baby trust me on this

       "275162  when folks think of  they think of anthony quinn many actors get forever associated with one of their movie roles but more than quinn in this movie thats because movie is a good match for his acting talents and it gave him a chance to show off his stuff and as such movie is a great character study for him however while many consider it to be a classic quinns performance cannot make up for weak writing and aside from his character movie is quite difficult to love first plot is meandering too meandering it strains a persons attention span since it is so slow and at times plot-less second although quinns character as well as french womans lila kedrova were very good rest of characters are pretty flat other greeks seem more like window dressing than people i am not greek but i wonder if movie does them a disservice surely they are not all knife-wielding men and shreiking women but in this movie apart from a exceptions thats all they seem to be but worst of them is role given to british man alan bates as he is almost zombie-like in movie sure i understand that he was supposed to be repressed and stiff but not to point of rigor mortis he had all emotional range and intensity as mr potatohead and he should have been far more complex and interesting as a counterpart to quinns fun-loving zorba my advice is to see movie for quinns bravura performance but accept that it really isnt that great a movie a classic hardly but a darn good part for an actor who up until this point in his career was seen as a supporting actor and not a major player

       "275163   is one of those movie totally dominated by had anthony quinn not alread won two oscars albeit in supporting actor category he might have copped best actor award for this lusty portrayal of a middle aged greek who just takes life as it comes this movie is what is meant by vehicle having said that i do have to wonder why half english half greek alan bates didnt just pack up and leave crete after what he had been through bates who has lived in united kingdom all his life and is quintessential englishman a bit on shy side who falls in with older quinn part of his inheritance is a lignite mine which bates would like to see activated again you would hope he would have hired a geologist to see if it was worth effort bates is completely enthralled with quinn who just lives from day to day quinn builds him a rube goldberg like contraption to bring shoring timber from a mountain top forest for mine that ends very chaotically both get involved with women and it ends rather badly for both in fact manner of death for both irene papas and lila kedrova would have sent this one if he were batess place scurrying back to london but as british were wont to say back then bates has gone native managing to get a innings in herself in face of domineering quinn is french actress lila kedrova who plays an aged frenchwoman who was set up real nice in a hotel that a former paramour and she had kedrova got an oscar for best supporting actress and she does well for herself i have to say i liked movie didnt really like people it portrayed they do have a hard life but there are some things there are not any excuse for

       "275164  i remember 1964 like yesterday but it seems that i too have outgrown movies of this period i had never seen this movie but know that it was loved by many opportunity arose for me to watch it in 2017 and i eagerly sat down to experience this missing link with past what a let down has world changed that much that i consider this to be a complete disaster let alone a comedy fair enough i have never been to crete or greece but i do love greek music for this reason is a notch higher then what i would otherwise have given it but for rest it was a big boring non inspiring wasteful stretched out rumble on island devoid of any possible reality to life in those days perhaps i miss point but i certainly did not enjoy movie at all

       "275166  i had a chance to see movie right after read book movie is a very faithful adaptation due to time constraints many of discussions and dialogues between zorba and narrator has been chopped off it leaves kazantcakis philosophy dangling since movie is not as pushy as book in making audience ponder about zorbas unique view of life its definitely a contrasting view when compared to that of narrators movie greatest neglect is what happens at monastery and zorbas view on them i guess it would have been controversial anyway since when scorcese adapted kazantcakis other novel temptation of christ i remember my father saying hell broke loose in new orleans i wish i had a couple of my friends with me while watch final dance i would have danced with them only downfall of movie is it takes 20 minutes for expected chemistry to form between alan bates and anthony quinn until then we see dialogues copied from novel without any justification given to why they are what they are something which exists in book zorbas sentences about dolphin in ship are simply lost meaningless but once they arrive on island i guess both actors smell cretan air and then rest is zembek definitely something to be watch and pondered upon

       "275168  thing that impressed me about movie was not character of zorba which i did not find that amazing but it was difference and conflicts between him his boss and villagers which made this movie interesting for me cacoyannis did a great job in picturing villagers this movie sounded like a bitter comedy to me in parts movie did not make sense to me well they have to follow novel for example when widow got killed i guess he had to get killed otherwise they did not know how to continue story

       "275171  for a movie about actively cultivating a lust for life  is a real downer anthony quinn famously plays zorba a larger-than-life greek who befriends strait-laced uptight alan bates when latter comes to claim a family home on greek seashore bates wants to reinvigorate local mining business but in a roundabout plot development decides he first needs timber to refurbish mine so he and zorba concoct this plan to get trees down from hillside on a sort of zip line so that they can use them to beef up mine which can then be used to revitalize mining industry if all of this seems both impractical and needlessly complicated it is but dont worry as this whole story line is treated as an aside and whole thing fails anyway movie instead is much more about two men and their interactions with local women namely a sad french lonelyhearts played by lila kedrova and a surly widow played by irene papas she has good reason to be surly as this particular greek island is inhabited by men who want to stone her because she doesnt like any of them that this is ultimately allowed without any of men involved having to face justice is infuriating and puzzling and i had to chalk it up to my own lack of understanding of cultural context of time and place women in this movie are treated miserably and what happens to them is depressing but even without that this whole greek community is depressing populated by uneducated people who live and act not much better than animals zorba consciously sets out to not be like them and make a joyous life out of this not very joyous situation but one does wonder why he sticks around at all alan batess character is infuriating for a whole different reason hes our main protagonist yet hes so ineffectual as a human being just standing around gazing upon horror he witnesses without doing a damn thing about any of it that hes awfully hard to care about i guess were supposed to think hes grown as a person because at end hes able to dance wildly with zorba on beach but i didnt see much of a change in his character as bates plays him i guess this was a pretty well made movie and a much meatier one than i expected it to be but as im thinking back on it im realizing that i didnt really enjoy it that much winner of three academy awards in year that saw it go up against studio juggernauts my fair lady and mary poppins best

lila kedrova zobra has an idea to log mountain while basil falls for ostracized widow irene papas that music is infectious it pumps up joy time its played thats how i feel about quinns zorba he is a force of nature and full of life hes also a very deep character and one of great performances of all times widows story is crazy scary and her climatic scene is so compelling in fact its so fearful

       "275173  nikos kazantzakis perhaps best known for writing novel upon which martin scorseses temptation of christ was based wrote  in 1946 novel was adapted for screen in 1964 by director michael cacoyannis plot alan bates plays basil an english writer who has travelled to greek island of crete to write a novel here he meets and befriends zorba anthony quinn an old man who teaches emotionally reserved basil to joyously celebrate life this is all mirrored to basils attempts to write a novel on buddha though issue of buddhism goes unsaid in movie in which he tries to convey ascetic qualities of theologian and philosopher much of movie clashes basils personality genteel mannered and well dressed with rugged charms of zorba zorba passionate dionysus to basils reflective and rational appolo says whats on his mind is unrestrained and unconcerned about appearances way movie contrasts one ascetic and one sensual character of course recalls temptation of christ indeed kazantzakis novel and to a lesser extent cacoyannis movie abounds with dualities man vs god god vs devil man vs woman freedom vs slavery wrath vs forgiveness drudgery vs miracles reality vs dreams madness vs sanity searching vs finding etc basil is himself frequently admonished by zorba for missing divine beauty all around him life is filled with a sacred awe he says as he tries to indoctrinate basil into religion of zorba to this end basil must essentially open up rid himself of buddha esoteric philosophies and ground himself in world of men and mud incidentally kazantzakis was himself a bookish reflective person much like basil but he also admired men of energy and action like nietzsche he despised bourgeois civilisation which he deemed tainted by technology materialism and creature comforts and was eager to see bourgeois society swept away by cleansing tides of violence this led kazantzakis to attach himself to extremist political movement that came along regardless of where on political spectrum they lay he hoped to restore a kind of pagan vitality a kind of freedom over bourgeois values in which men are free to embrace matter vitality flesh and instinct over soul contemplation spirit and reason only in this way he said is matter truly transformed into spirit movie irene papas as a brooding quietly passionate window who desires basil rest of movie utilises actual cretian inhabitants and actual greek locations overlong and dull in places and philosophically dumber than it realises movie is enlivened by some strong black-and-white cinematography by john lassally he creates a craggy and inhospitable crete kazantzakiss homerian epic odyssey a modern sequel would be hailed as a masterpiece in 1958 he was considered for nobel prize in literature in 1957
