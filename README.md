# Read It or Watch It?

## Motivation

Given the number of movies that are sourced from pre-existing books, it is common for readers/movie viewers to ask the question: “Should I read the book, or should I watch the movie?”  Today, researching this question must be done manually, with many separate steps.  A prospective reader or movie viewer would visit individual movie and/or book review websites, Amazon reviews, and/or social media posts to get opinions on their path forward.
