0,10804,81631546,it was amazing,"Wally Stegner...sigh...my literary crush. There are 31 stories in this collection, written over a period of about 50 years. Naturally, the subject matter and quality varies. Stegner himself chose the stories for inclusion, as well as their arrangement in the collection. He clearly knew his best writing, because the better stories are in the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the book. In the Foreword, Stegner says about the stories: ""I lived them, either as a participant or spectator or auditor, before I made fictions of them...and because the world and I were changing at an ever accelerating rate, some stories reflect events, social attitudes, and even diction that now seem dated."" Yes! This is what makes the collection worth reading. It covers so many time periods and lifestyles that are forever gone, preserved in literary amber by one who actually lived through those bygone eras. The stories cover a variety of historical topics: the 1918 influenza epidemic, WWII wives waiting for letters from their soldier husbands, ranching life on the plains of Saskatchewan, and Prohibition days in Salt Lake City. All from someone who was there. I think the most perfect story in the collection is ""Double Corner."" It showcases Stegner's talent for creating a powerful sense of place, as well as his ability to express the beautiful and heartbreaking impulses that make us human. If you read no other stories in this book, at least read this one. ""Double Corner"" is about a little family of California fruit growers who try to take on the task of caring for the husband's mother rather than placing her in an old folks' home. But the mother has dementia, and all their love and good intentions may not be enough to keep her safe and keep themselves from falling apart. Stegner lets us see how difficult it is for everyone when a loved one is losing mental faculties, and how frightening life becomes for the one with dementia. ""Grandma's mind was a terrified little animal trembling in a dark hole while danger walked outside.""I also really liked ""Volcano,"" a very short piece that takes place in Mexico. It's an excellent example of writing to show rather than just tell.",en
1,10804,92943063,it was amazing,"Most brilliant collection of short stories. Stegner has a way of describing a scene that puts the reader right into the story. In the first story, The Traveler, you feel the snow, the cold, and the darkness. The Colt will break your heart. In The City of the Living, you ache for the father's concern over his ill son. ",en
2,10804,113564147,really liked it,"Collected Stories of Wallace Stegner is a large collection of short stories that largely concentrate on the American West in the first half of the 20th century. I’ve read a couple of Wallace Stegner’s novels—Angle of Repose, and Crossing to Safety, which I really responded to, and knew that with this collection I’d be settling in for a few weeks’ appreciative and thoughtful reading. I was also interested by the note at the beginning that let me know that some of this material made it into novels later on, so I was happy, too, to be getting a taste of his other books. I wasn’t prepared for the harshness to many of these stories, and at times I found it very difficult to pick up the book again. It is hard to read these kinds of things, over and over, and it occurs to me that it is one thing to read a story like this in a magazine, and another some long time after, and quite another to read them one after another in succession without a break. If I had known it would be like this, I would, I think, not have read them this way. So yet again I find myself grateful for not knowing ahead of time what I was in for.I love how the people talk. So many of them talk like people I know, or people in family stories I’ve heard. My dad grew up in Montana, and I grew up in the Bay Area of northern California, and I like hearing about places like these, and others I’m not so familiar with. I like the new words I learn, especially the ones I gradually get a feel for, and I like knowing how people work. It’s amazing how little you ever know about the jobs you don’t do, and no matter how many times we have the small conversation about what we do, it never comes out as clearly as it does in these stories. These are people I remember, in the end, and the relationships between wives and husbands, and fathers and sons are real ones, and it’s amazing to me how Stegner seems to be on everyone’s side without ever moving from one position to another. It’s wonderful how substantial the stories are—like some kind of rich ore he’s got, where he only has to point out a vein or two, and he lets you find the rest.",en
3,10804,138286978,it was amazing,"I don't think there is anyone better at using metaphor to capture the essence of emotion or experience. There was at least one time in each story when I caught my breath, stopped and reread a phrase that was stunning. For example, in the story Impasse, Stegner speaks in the voice of a father describing his college-aged daughter...""With Margaret along, conversation was too dangerous. She terrorized them; she was like a rodeo cowboy waiting at the gate, ready to burst out on any bewildered steer of opinion that showed in the arena. If you said anything, affirmed anything, denied anything, liked or disliked anything, you grew horns for her to throw you with.""  In his forward to the collection, Stegner says that a short story is a young writer's form, that the novel has swallowed potential stories and that his first agent said that a short-story writer lives on is principal, using up beginnings and endings."" Principal well spent.",en
4,10804,1173895269,it was amazing,"Wallace Stegner is a master of the word, but his real gift is his piercing insight into his characters. Every one of them feels realized, even in these short stories.Sadly, I only finished about half of these before the library asked for it back.",en
5,10804,486137786,really liked it,"Thirty-one stories by one of my favorite writers. Not a bad one in the bunch. Wonderful writing by a master.The Traveler: The car of a traveling salesman breaks down on a very cold night in a remote area. After unsuccessful attempts to restart his car and to keep warm by a fire, he finally starts walking. A mile or so down the road he comes to a farmhouse. No one answers the door, but a young boy finally emerges from a nearby shed. The boy explains that his grandfather has recently become comatose, so he is hitching up the sleigh to go for help. The boy has no parents, lives with his grandfather in a house that has no phone. The salesman offers to ride the sleigh to go for help while the boy tends to his grandfather. Buglesong: A boy lives in a rural setting where he is the champion gopher trapper. He always saves or specially traps one live gopher to feed to his captive weasel. His mother worries about her son's education and encourages him to read a book of poetry, which he takes along on his rounds to read while he waits. The poetry is like music to the boy. It almost transports him to another place – specifically, the Bearpaw Mountains which he can see in the distance and where he dreams of going to.Beyond the Glass Mountain: A successful young man returns to his college town several years after graduation. He feels a great sense of nostalgia being there and reflects on his memories – contrasting the carefree and energetic days of his youth with the fleeting and mundane passage of time as he has aged. He has returned to the town to visit one of his old friends who still lives there. The friend is an alcoholic, married, with one child. The purpose of the visit is to inform his friend of his wife's infidelity and to encourage him to leave her and his troublesome life behind. After visiting for a very short while with the couple, he concludes that he cannot carry out his original plan. He leaves, but not before he recognizes that his friend is well aware of the situation he is in.The Berry Patch: A man on leave during WWII goes to a wild berry patch with his wife. They pick berries and talk about their life and how their recent separation has impacted them. They feel a certain security that their relationship will survive the upcoming trials.The Women on the Wall: From the window near his desk a writer notices several women who daily congregate to await the mailman. He realizes that they are all wives of servicemen who are overseas. He determines to get to know them and their stories. He is received coldly and suspiciously by them, but he persists. In the following days one woman receives word that her husband has been killed. Then one day he witnesses a vicious fight between two of them. They both immediately cease fighting upon hearing that the mailman has arrived.Balance His, Swing Yours: A man visiting a resort is irritated at a pompous, intruding Englishman, especially when he begins bragging about his tennis expertise. When the man challenges the Englishman to a match, the Englishman begins making excuses, but the man counters each excuse, and eventually the match begins. The man thrashes the Englishman, to the delight of a couple of young men the man had earlier befriended. Later, however, at the bar, the man feels somewhat unwelcome, out of place, and friendless.Saw Gang: A 15-year-old boy works at a lumber mill with several other young men, all older than he. He is amazed at how hard and how eagerly they work, and he assumes it is because they all respect and feel indebted to the mills owner who works alongside them and who furnishes them with decent breaks and meals. The boy realizes that he is probably last in the pecking order at the mill.Goin' to Town: A young farm boy is nearly overcome with excitement and anticipation because of his family's plans to go into town on the 4th of July to see the parade and participate in the festivities. However, when the time comes to finally depart, the old car will simply not start. The father goes to near heroic measures to try to start it – all to no avail. The boy is extremely disappointed, but eventually he accepts it.The View from the Balcony: A group of mostly married college students all live somewhat communally in a building with a large common area and a balcony high above the ground which affords them a beautiful view of the surrounding area. One of the graduate students there gets cold feet and chokes during his final presentation. The “community” comes to his and his wife's aid. A party is thrown which involves a fairly free flow of alcohol. Two faculty members arrive at the party to encourage the despondent grad student. One of them actually picks a fight with a different student and seems intent on throwing him over the balcony before the fight is stopped by the other party goers. When the party finally ends, the other faculty member is unable to locate his wife. He suspects that she has run off with someone, so he goes looking for her in the riverine area below the balcony.Volcano: An American visits Paricutin, the site of a volcano that suddenly rose out of a Mexican cornfield and completely played out its active phase in a mere few years. The author describes the desolation and eeriness as dust and ash blanket the area. The American observes the stubborn persistence of some of the inhabitants who attempt to remain and live their lives there.Two Rivers: A continuation of the story Goin' To Town. The next morning the young boy learns that the car has been fixed and they will be going to the mountains. He is elated. As they travel he recalls vague memories of being in some mountains as a very small child, of falling and squishing blackberries in his hand, and of getting washed off in a river that is part warm and part cold. His dad thinks it's all the boy's wild imagination, but his mom realizes that he is actually remembering a specific trip they took to the mountains in Washington. She wonders why their memories are all so different from each others'.Hostage: A young boy is held by police for a long time (days?) while he is interrogated by a detective and an insurance agent about how a fire started that destroyed the family (conveniently insured) shed. The boy insists that barn swallows attacked him and made him drop his candle when he was sent to the shed on a chore. Eventually, his mom shows up and confesses that she and her husband (the boy's step-dad) planned the whole thing knowing that the swallows would do what they did, but when the candle failed to ignite the shed, the step-dad went out and completed the job.In the Twilight: A young boy hates the pig he is required to feed and care for and is excited for the scheduled butchering day. When it arrives he and his brother watch as their father shoots the pig between the eyes with a .22. The bullet fails to kill the pig, and it frantically runs and thrashes about until the dad can finally plug it a second time. This spectacle sickens the boy, he faints and is escorted into the house. When he returns to the butchering scene he is ridiculed by his brother and the other boys who have showed up. The dad shows the boys how to blow up the bladder like a bouncy ball, which the boys then kick and play with. The boy sickens again and vows that he will eat none of the pig's meat, but later in a kind of ritual the boy kicks the bladder-ball with all his might and triumphs in his victory over his sentimental emotions.Butcher Bird: A rural family travels a few miles to visit their new closest neighbor, a British man and his American wife. The visiting family has different reactions to this new family. The woman is very impressed with the Brit's manners and politeness while the man is completely put off by everything about him, and he especially resents the way his wife seems to adore the Brit and his knowledge. The woman wants to attempt to plant some willow trees at their homestead as suggested by the Brit, but her husband rejects the idea out of hand. The couple's young son is disturbed by his parents' fighting, but he is overjoyed at the .22 rifle the Brit gifted to him.The Double Corner: A couple with twin young boys bring the father's senile old mother home to live with them. The man is already quite convinced that things would be better for both his mother and for his family if she were in some form of nursing home. The wife, however, feels otherwise and makes every effort to care for the old woman and help her feel at home. When the old woman kills her cat by stashing it in her suitcase in order to hide it from her imaginary enemies, the mother finally recognizes the hopelessness and even the danger of keeping the old woman in her home.The Colt: A colt is born with deformities in its front legs. The young boy who cares for the horses wants to utilize braces to nurse the colt to health despite his father's insistence that it is highly unlikely to be successful. After several weeks of dedicated care the colt showed little or no improvement. When the time comes for the family to move to their homestead for the summer, a family friend agrees to buy the colt from the boy for three dollars with the stipulation that he will faithfully care for the colt, and sell it back to the boy when the family returns – if the colt has healed. On the way to the homestead the family first drives to the dump to deliver keys to the caretaker. As they drive through the dump they see the skinned carcass of the colt – recognizable by its distinctive hoof patterns.The Chink: A boy gets caught up in mob mentality with his friends on Halloween night and tip over the outhouse of a Chinese store owner who had earlier rebuked some of the kids. Because they had heard a whimper from inside the outhouse, they assumed it was the store owner, so they nailed the door shut. Later, the boy, feeling bad about what had happened, goes back and pries the door open to find the store owner's brother, with whom he was quite friendly, inside and unconscious. The boy summons the man's brother for help at the same time that he begins feeling very ill (this occurs during the great Spanish flu epidemic of 1918). He goes home and lies in a feverish semi-conscious state for over a week. When he finally recovers he learns that his Chinese friend is dead.Chip off the Old Block: A 12-year-old boy is left home alone when his entire family is stricken with the Spanish flu in fall of 1918. He safeguards his dad's supply of medicinal whiskey from thieves and does a good job of holding down the fort. He even uses some of his spare time to write an adventurous short story. He hears of townsfolk dying from the epidemic and he worries about his family. One day he hears the sounds of celebration from the town. It's November 11. The war is over. He invites neighbors to his house to celebrate. The whiskey is passed around. During the festivities the boy's family arrives – they have been released from the hospital, all have survived. The father is angry and disappointed at the boy for being so wasteful with the hard-earned whiskey, but eventually and with the help of the boy's mother, he comes around to realize what a good boy he has been.The Sweetness of the Twisted Apples: An artist and his wife travel through rural Vermont looking for landscapes to paint. They encounter a nearly abandoned farm area where a very few hangers-on still live. They visit for a short while with a woman and her waif-like adult daughter who tell them about the road ahead which becomes impassable due to overgrowth not far ahead. The girl and her mom repeatedly refer to the past in terms of when the girl was “goin' out.” Leaving the two women the couple drives ahead and find a beautiful scene to paint with a large orchard of old untended apple trees. While the man paints, the woman explores and then begins to gather apples to take home because, despite their stunted size, they taste wonderful. While hauling apples, the woman is surprised to see the farm girl there. The two of them talk a little. The woman asks the girl about what it is like to live in such a seemingly haunted place. The girl responds that it isn't haunted, and that she used to come up to this area all the time when she was “goin' out.”The Blue-Winged Teal: A man returns to his father's bar carrying several ducks he has just recently shot. His father and the low-life employees are impressed and plan a feast for the next day. The man dislikes his father for a variety of reasons and intends to tell him that he is leaving him. The feast goes well and the man eventually tells his dad his feelings in a cordial way.Pop Goes the Alley Cat: A photographer accompanies a social worker to some poverty-stricken neighborhood to get some pictures for an upcoming article. A black youth from the area also accompanies them. When the young man is sent in the woman's car on an errand he fails to return and and photographer realizes that one of his cameras is missing. He assumes the young man took it and feels disdain for him. The social worker and the photographer discuss the merits of forgiveness and kindness and if or when we should give up on someone.Maiden in a Tower: A man returns to Salt Lake City to see to the funeral arrangements of his aunt. The funeral home just happens to be in the same building in which he courted a vivacious young woman more than 25 years earlier. He cares almost nothing about his aunt, but is determined to see the place of his sexual coming of age. The undertaker permits him to visit the room in a tower where a particularly memorable experience took place, even though the corpse of a woman is laid out in the room. The man nostalgically reminisces about the past and wonders what became of the woman.Impasse: A couple vacations in Europe with their grown, but angry and ill-mannered, daughter who seems to want to argue and fight about everything. The father recognizes that his daughter is unattractive and has limited potential when it comes to achieving her goals, especially social goals. The girl obviously knows this fact too.The Volunteer: An intelligent and hard-working young boy volunteers to build a model Roman camp structure for his teacher. His father has turned the family house into a speakeasy where customers come to drink and socialize without fear of the law. The boy and his mother really hate what goes on in the house.A Field Guide to the Western Birds: A writer goes to a party which a friend of his is throwing in order to showcase a talented piano player she has discovered. The writer despises the arrogant and self-centered manner of the musician, and he is less than impressed by his musical abilities as well.Something Spurious from the Mindanao Deep: A journalist in the Philipines observes that his friend is being manipulated by a woman who wants him to commit to her. The woman goes so far as to take a lethal dosage of pills in order to get his attention.Genesis: A newly-hired cowboy from England struggles to fit in and cope with the rigors of cattle driving in Saskatchewan during the freezing fall and winter. The group is forced to seek shelter several miles distant during a terribly cold and windy snowstorm in which the Englishman saves the life of one of the other cowhands. The Wolfer: A Canadian Mountie tracks the wolf trapper from the previous story (Genesis) because he fears the trapper may be lost and stranded on the bitter cold plains. He finds the man's dead hound – shot through the head in what he speculates was an accident of mistaken identity – but he never finds the trapper, who is never seen or heard of again.Carrion Spring: In the Spring following the terrible winter of 1905 the wife (Molly) of the foreman (Ray) from the story Genesis has determined to leave the wild prairie for her home and parents, but Ray is staying regardless, and he wishes she would too. They set off in the wagon together and pass several stinking masses of winter-killed cattle. They encounter the son of the wolfer who is busy digging out a den of coyote mom and pups. Ray stops to help, and together they slaughter the mother coyote and one of the two pups. Molly rescues the second pup and insists on saving and raising it. As Ray and Molly talk while taking in the beautiful expanse of the prairie Molly eventually decides that she could stay.He Who Spits at the Sky: A journalist photographer goes to a wealthy lawyer's house where a party is being held celebrating the release of some Mexicans who evidently were unjustly imprisoned. The journalist witnesses one of the Mexicans violently assault his girlfriend, now in need of quick medical attention. The Mexican and celebrating lawyers, in order to protect their cause against possible bad publicity, insist that the girl was injured in a fall. The journalist, who actually saw it, insists otherwise, and points out that one other person witnessed it also – one of the other former prisoners, who subsequently lies for his own self interest.The City of the Living: A divorced man tends his sick son in Egypt. The boy's typhoid is life-threatening and the man is very anxious and worried, especially when he notices that despite his dedicated adminstering of antibiotics, the fever persists. When the fever finally drops and the boy is obviously on the road to recovery the man rejoices. Later he ponders the efficacy of various forms of prayers – especially his own subtle personal prayers compared to the more public prayers of the millions of Muslims in the area.",en
6,10804,1854709248,really liked it,"This was my first full fledged immersion into this author's work (after a failed attempt at reading one of his novels), and I was immediately impressed with the skill set he brings to the page. Wendell Berry's and Alice Munro's level of word craft came to mind at first, but it soon became clear this author was not offering any of Berry's sense of humor, and, by the end, it became obvious it would never be offered. The story settings were often reminiscent of Ivan Doig's work, but ultimately I found what I have read from Kent Haruf came closest to what I read here. There was also a rather jarring splash of John Updike in the mix. Amidst the entire collection, at least three different sets of stories are connected. In one case, the second story in its set comes spaced well after the first, and I was a bit startled to realize it took up immediately after the earlier one. This separation in the full collection is particularly odd when, later in the collection, three stories in a row are from a new set, but not obviously following immediately in narrative time. All this is probably a bit inconsequential when laid against the author's overall tone in his stories. I was constantly reminded of a story I had been told (perhaps erroneously, because I can't find confirmation of it now), in which Andrew Carnegie supposedly told his daughter, ""Life would be so much easier for you once you realize life is hard."" This story collection repeatedly points out various folks in various situations and settings, struggling hard and often not even achieving ""two steps forward and one step back"" status. Unfortunately, it was never clear to me whether the author just thought life was hard or if he was ultimately pointing out that he wondered if it was all worth it. The good news is he writes so well, you feel obligated to hear him out, regardless.",en

10,10804,1798269365,it was amazing,"This collection of stories ranges across the world and much of the twentieth century. The cowboy stories alone are so rich in natural detail, living characters, and compelling plot and action. A paragraph description of a greenhorn cowboy thrown from his horse into the path of a stampeding bull is like a Remington sculpture. A rancher and his wife travel by wagon through the aftermath of a catastrophic winter on the way to the railroad flag stop as she ponders whether she will ever return.

11,10804,441804458,it was ok,"Though these were well-crafted short essays, they simply don't do Stegner justice. Yes, the magnificent prose is there and he still describes places and moments with such clarity that you can see them in your mind's eye.

Read his novels instead.",en
12,10804,45061224,really liked it,"I really like Wallace Stegner (even though I haven't ever made it all the way through Angle of Repose...) These stories are terrific, and run the gamut from farm boys to country club tennis.

20,10804,1999226095,it was amazing," The author states in his preface: ""...the thirty-one stories in this volume do make sort of personal record. I lived them, either as participant or spectator or auditor, before I made fictions of them...Any reasonably long life, looked back upon, irresistibly suggests a journey. I see these stories, inventions on a base of experience, as rest stops, pauses while I tried to understand something or digest some action or clarify some response."" (p. ix) For this reason, the stories' protagonists hop about in age, but the themes increase in depth and complexity, running from the simple drunken delight in life to loneliness and isolation, discovering one's true nature, love, and, in ""The City of the Living"" to reflections on the divine.  The book works, too, as a sort of ""Greatest Hits,"" with the caveat that those selections taken from longer works are not identified. Though the settings of the stories vary, and Stegner's self-confessed ""tyrannous sense of place"" does justice to locales from Silicon Valley to the Valley of the Kings, the majority take place in the rural Canadian and American west.

, I think Wallace Stegner is a wonderful writer. I think he easily merits a spot alongside contemporaries like, say, John Steinbeck and Norman Mailer, and wish he had received similar recognition in his life. Incidentally, this collection of stories reminds me very much of a similar Steinbeck collection that I read years ago.But having said that I'm going to confess that I am returning my copy to the library only half-read. Two stories in it are truly memorable -- ""The Traveler,"" in which someone in rather urgent need of help discovers he can bring help to someone else, and ""Goin' to Town,"" which dramatizes an exceedingly frustrating and disappointing childhood experience. Several pages later, a companion story provides redemption for ""Goin' to Town."" In fact, there are interrelationships among most if not all of these stories, almost but not quite tying them together into a larger narrative.The trouble for me is that, having thoroughly admired a story like one of the above, I then feel underwhelmed by subsequent stories that don't quite hit the mark. Actually, I feel this way about all the collections I read; inevitably some will be better than others. Maybe that's why I've been reluctant to put my own little stories together in a collection (not that I presume any comparison with this author!).I will probably return to try Stegner's collected stories again at some future point.

29,10804,1750461979,liked it,"I gave myself permission to stop reading these stories after finishing 300+ of 529 pages. While I enjoy Stegner's writing for his ability to portray a wide variety of settings and to comprehend and convey the inner thoughts/ reactions and emotions of people, I wish he were not so bent toward a dreary realism that wants for hopefulness. Stegner shows great skill in expressing gut-wrenching regret, hopelessness, and major disappointment in story form. While this makes for a thought-provoking read the first time, reading two or three of these depressants in a row is well, depressing!My favorite story of those I read was 'The Sweetness of the Twisted Apples'. It evoked the carefree beauty and freedom of summertime despite its somber, even eerie undertones. And the character who is the natural object of pity is herself bolstered by the sweetness of good memories, thus leaving a hopeful aftertaste to the story. I would like to try a Stegner novel to see if it modifies my opinions as expressed here. Crossing to Safety is on my radar.",en
30,10804,1457385765,it was amazing,"Stegner can turn a phrase. He has such an understated, elegant way of making his point. “The light over the whole hill was pure, pale, of an exaggerated clarity, as if all the good days of his youth had been distilled down into this one day, and the whole coltish ascendant time when he was eighteen, nineteen, twenty, had been handed back to him briefly, intact and precious.” This collection of stories might be hard to read one right after the other, because most of them depict disappointment. But isn’t that life? Stegner uses a masculine tone of earthiness and nature and just telling it the way it is. He doesn’t give people that break they are looking for. I wondered if the format of the short story itself accentuated the negative. With such a short arc, maybe the writer goes straight for the climax and doesn’t give you enough of the compensating happy times? Sure, the kid’s horse dies, the man loses his friend, the schoolyard buddy dies, the sparrow dies, but there must have been bright spots too. Don’t read these stories for the content; read them for the slice of life and the amazing writing. “But he did not say it in anger, or with the cold command of himself that he had imagined in advance. He said it like a cry, and with the feeling he might have had on letting go the hand of a friend too weak and too exhausted to cling any longer to their inadequate shared driftwood in a wide cold sea.”",en

70,38463,2636037953,it was amazing,"”I thought of Fonny’s touch, of Fonny, in my arms, his breath, his touch, his odor, his weight, that terrible and beautiful presence riding into me and his breath being snarled, as if by a golden thread, deeper and deeper in his throat as he rode--as he rode deeper and deeper not so much into me as into a kingdom which lay just behind his eyes. He worked on wood that way. He worked on stone that way. If I had never seen him work, I might never have known he loved me. It’s a miracle to realize that somebody loves you.”
Stephen James and Kiki Layne star in the 2018 film that was released on December 25th.Fonny and Tish have known each other nearly their entire lives. Sometimes relationships like this evolve into being friends or at least acquaintances for life. Sometimes they become lovers, and when lightning strikes the same place twice, they become lovers and best friends. Lightning struck twice.This is a tale of two families. Tish’s family is not only supportive of the relationship but go so far as to consider Fonny part of their family. As Tish and Fonny are caught up in the whirlwind of 1970s racist New York, the support of Tish’s family is the only thing standing between Fonny spending a good part of his life in jail and Tish having to work the streets to make enough money to afford a lawyer for his defense. Fonny’s family is a different story. His mother has never thought highly of him or his prospects. She is a religious nut who, in her fervor for her God, has lifted herself up above the rest of humanity. From this perch, she can cast judgments down on those around her, especially those not heeding the call of the church. She would be a better Christian if she were casting bread instead of casting aspersions. Fonny’s two older sisters, taking their cues from their mother, are dismissive of their little brother as well and find it embarrassing, rather than tragic, that he has been arrested. They are sure he is guilty because they have found him guilty his whole life. Fonny’s father is an interesting character. He is a man who loves his family, but he knows that Fonny needs his love more than the rest. Tish’s father, Joseph, is always bucking Frank up, giving him hope.
”’Look. I know what you’re saying. You’re saying they got us by the balls. Okay. But that’s our flesh and blood, baby: our flesh and blood. I don’t know how we going to do it. I just know we have to do it. I know you ain’t scared for you., and God knows I ain’t scared for me. That boy is got to come out of there. That’s all. And we got to get him out. That’s all. And the first thing we got to do, man, is just not to lose our nerve. We can’t let those cunt-faced, white-assed motherfuckers get away with this shit any longer.’ He subsides, he sips his beer. ‘They been killing our children long enough.’”
James Baldwin was proclaiming that #blacklivesmatter from the beginning of his existence as a writer. Being a young, virile, prideful, black man in the 1970s was a dangerous thing to be. Fonny, by breathing the same air and walking the same streets as the predominantly white police force, has committed a crime. Yes, he has committed a crime by existing. When he comes to the attention of one particular cop, it is only a matter of time before he is put in the frame for something. This cop has an interest in Fonny that is akin to sexual desire. He pursues him like a spurned lover pursues the person of their affection. He is the head of the hammer of white fear. ”He walked the way John Wayne walks, striding out to clean up the universe, and he believed all that shit: a wicked, stupid, infantile motherfucker. Like his heroes, he was kind of a pinheaded, heavy gutted, big assed, and his eyes were as blank as George Washington’s eyes. But I was beginning to learn something about the blankness of eyes. What I was learning was beginning to frighten me to death. If you look steadily into that unblinking blue, into that pinpoint at the center of the eye, you discover a bottomless cruelty, a viciousness cold and icy. In that eye, you do not exist: if you are lucky”The problem is that Fonny is at the pinpoint of that blue eye. This is a book about injustice, about family sticking together, about community, and it is about love, real love, soul trembling love. It is the type of love that, when your lover walks in the room, you feel your insides turn to Champagne with frenzied bubbles and a cork in your throat trembling to hold it all in. One thing I’ve learned about life is those that have the least to give, give the most. 
Two Bards hanging out together. The conversation they would have had over a bottle of wine.James Baldwin moved to Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France in 1970. This book was published in 1974. Even though he was an American in exile, America came to him. Miles Davis, Josephine Baker, Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, Ray Charles, and many more made pilgrimages to see him. He spent most of his days writing and responding to correspondence from all over the world. He changed lives with his gift of hope and his honesty about what was really happening to Black America. Every time I read one of his books, I am struck by the power of his prose and the passion of his anger. He was determined to drag America, kicking and screaming, under a soul revealing, bright light so the demons of inequality, racism, and hatred have a chance to be exorcised. f you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten",en

I went to a screening last Saturday with a friend. Here are some thoughts, which I shared in the comments section in response to Nicole: I found the film adaptation to be just the kind of movie I would expect from Barry Jenkins, and yet not what I would have imagined as a film adaptation of this book. In my mind's eye, I saw something grittier, something heavier. Jenkin's adaptation isn't that – it is an incredibly striking film that is visually impeccable in a way that seems so intentional it's almost heavy-handed and too controlled. That said, it's a beautiful and devasting movie that appropriately (& tenderly) elevates the themes of black love (romantic and familial) found in the book, and juxtaposes it with the despair of Fonny's unjust incarceration. I especially loved the scene between Fonny & his friend Daniel. It was full of vulnerability between the two men, and a visceral foreshadowing of what was to come for Fonny.A profile of Barry Jenkins that I like, an interview of Jenkins that I also liked &  a review of the film that I appreciated .",en
72,38463,2559293575,it was amazing,"Last year I got up from the rock I was under and finally discovered the writing of James Baldwin. In one of my goodreads group, I read Giovanni’s Room with a few friends. The writing was outstanding and the ensuing discussion even better. We made plans to read another Baldwin novel in January and I was game. I suggested If Beale Street Could Talk based on the title, having no idea that the story was soon to be released as a movie. The title evokes images of a Memphis blues house and I envisioned luscious prose. While the plans for a buddy read fizzled out, I went ahead with sticking to my own reading plan, selecting If Beale Street Could Talk as my first novel of the year. There are few American master storytellers I can return to again and again and not be disappointed. My two favorites are Steinbeck and McCullers, and Baldwin is slowly inching up the list, after only reading two novels. His prose is masterful and reels a reader in instantly, getting a feel for the time and place of the novel. Here we meet Tish Rivers. She is nineteen having come of age in 1970s New York, at a time when race politics were still fractious at best. Her parents Joseph and Sharon are in their early forties having had their children young and they would move water to support their two daughters. We find out that Tish is going to have the baby of her lifetime boyfriend and best friend, Fonny Hunt, only Fonny is imprisoned for being falsely accused of rape. The point of view is Tish’s and her sole goal is to get Fonny out of jail so that the couple can get married and raise their child together. Baldwin introduces the Hunts and Rivers’ families, all representing a different archetype of African American life. Mrs Hunt is a holy rolling church lady and her obedient daughters copy her every move. Her husband Frank is as hard working as can be given the lack of opportunities for jobs for African Americans at the time, and it is obvious that the family is split down the middle between the men and women. Mrs Hunt has disapproved of Fonny from childhood, not loving him for who he is and desiring that he become a respectable church going man. Yet, all Fonny has ever desired is to spend his life with Tish and to use his hand to be a woodworker. Baldwin’s prose favors Fonny as an artist, a woodworker, but he has never been good enough for his mother, and now he is in jail, and his mother could not care less, leaving the Rivers family to prove his innocence on their own. Tish has to be strong for Fonny, their baby, and herself. She has a strong support system in her parents and sister Ernestine, who are all as happy as can be for Tish to get married and start a family. We find out that Ernestine is a social worker and has connections in the white world, which will factor greatly in Fonny’s case. Procuring a respectable white lawyer as well as working for an actress who is sympathetic to their cause, it is Ernestine who shoulders most of Tish’s burden. Yet despite their being nine characters, the entire point of view is told through Tish. She alternates between her relationship with Fonny, then being completely in love and in tune with one another in body and soul, and the tense present time, where he is in jail and she spends every ounce of her being to get him out. At age nineteen, it is obvious that Baldwin has created a character in Tish who is wise beyond her years. As expected, the prose of If Beale Street Could Talk does flow like Memphis jazz and blues, between the fractious moments with the Hunts to the crescendo of love between Fonny and Tish. The soundtrack I had playing in my mind would translate well to the big screen, and I look forward to seeing the film version. Some goodreads users downgraded the overall novel due to Baldwin’s inability to tie up loose ends. It seems, however, that this is Baldwin’s style, and, like improvised music, it is up to the reader to create an ending for themselves. Even though this is my first official read of the year, the memorable characters and prose that Baldwin has created will undoubtedly catapult If Beale Street Could Talk to among my year’s best. I expect to be revisiting his work again in years to come. 5 stars ",en
73,38463,1586703560,really liked it,"I've never come across a Baldwin read I didn't love. Beale Street 'talked' something sexual and consciously charged. It is profound and suspenseful storytelling (I think I was on page 78 and still didn't know why Fonny was locked up, yet I went along patiently and willingly). This book is very different from the lyricism that is Go Tell It on the Mountain and Giovanni's Room, but the love story and angst is Baldwinian. I don't think I've come across such a vivid portrait of the urban, African-American, blue-collar family struggle as I have here. At some point I read( I believe it was in one of Maya Angelou's memoirs), that Baldwin once found himself flat on his back, on a paved lot, at the command of a police officer - the rest is implicitly stated. In this novel, it's not so implicit. The language is at times brutal, the pain palpable. What I'll say is this: in these times, when the truth is too harsh, and when it sometimes manifests itself into hateful rhetoric, as it did with Fonny's father, this book may not be for everyone. Better yet, if Ellison's Invisible Man is not your cup of tea, most likely this wouldn't be. The novel ends in a commune in France and if you know Baldwin's life story, you know at some point he became so disheartened, he left America to live in France.",en
74,38463,2610222997,really liked it,"A lyrical, rapturous, beautifully written short novel about love in the face of brutal injustice.Fonny and Tish are a young Black couple in early 1970s New York City. Fonny has been falsely accused of raping a Puerto Rican woman and is in prison; Tish, who narrates most of the book, is pregnant. Their families – especially Tish's – are working to get Fonny out of jail, but then, as now, the odds are stacked against a young Black man, especially when there's a racist cop looking to pin something on you. This is the first Baldwin novel I've read, but it won't be my last. The prose is rich and soulful; my heart ached for this young couple just starting out in the world, and I especially loved being inside Tish's inquiring mind. There's real pain and despair contained in the book; there's a section where Fonny and Tish meet up with Daniel, one of Fonny's old friends, and Daniel tells them what happened to him in prison (where he was sent after his own trumped-up charge). But there's just as much goodness. One sequence in which a young landlord agrees to rent a loft (Fonny is a sculptor) to the pair exudes warmth and affection. (He's Jewish; he knows they're in love and discriminated against.)I sought out this book because I had seen Barry Jenkins's (Moonlight) film adaptation a few months ago (it gets a general release soon). I was curious about the rapturous, romantic tone of the movie. Why wasn't there more about the false charge? What happened to the racist cop?I realize now, after having read the book, that those questions belong to another kind of movie, one we've all, sadly, seen before. This book is about hope, love, perseverance. It's about the endurance of the human spirit, if you will.If our city streets could talk, would they howl in anger and pain? Would they accuse? Those streets soak up so much blood, they witness prejudice, veiled and unveiled threats. They feel the weight of Black bodies brutally pushed down on them, handcuffed, beaten, shot, killed. The streets can't talk back. But they can witness. Baldwin, too, is a witness, and he's got one helluva powerful voice: urgent, necessary, passionate, forgiving.",en

Despite all of the odds, they stuck by each other and knew that their love, which developed from their youth, was worth fighting for. A love story that is HILARIOUS, full of superb dialogue, and critiques of criminal justice in the US that could have been written in 2025 (no typo). A book that also lives up to its eponymous street through James Baldwin's effortlessly poetic prose, hard earned wisdom, and blues references to spare.I look forward to this novel, that centered Black people and Blackness, as a movie.

77,38463,2559215453,really liked it,"This was a riveting read. Baldwin’s honest and emotion-laden writing grabs you from the start. He tells you a simple story of gross injustices inflicted on people of color in New York City in the 60s and 70s. Weaving into this narrative family love, passionate love between two young people, hope and despair, dogmatic prejudices and forgiveness, he transports you to a world that makes you throw your hands up in disbelief at the injustices and at the same time marvel at humanity.Fonny and Tish from their respective black families fall in love and are about to get married. Fonny loves the art of sculpting, but for this passion he has to tolerate his mother’s and sisters’ scorn. Just as Tish discovers that she’s with child, Fonny is thrown into prison on a false charge of rape, because a white policeman is set on ruining him out of spite. Tish’s parents and elder sister rally to help Fonny get exonerated. Meanwhile, Tish and Fonny are sustained by their love for each other and the baby in Tish’s womb.The beauty of the novel lies in the true-to-life characters that jump off the page.

78,38463,291186600,really liked it,"In one of the more memorable lines of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", Atticus Finch tells his daughter Scout to never judge a man until she's walked a mile in his shoes. The lesson, of course, is that it is not possible to walk a mile in another man's shoes (and therefore impossible to ever really know him), and therefore we should never judge.So if it is impossible to walk in another man's shoes, as an author James Baldwin gets us as close to this as is possible. His writing of disenfranchised African-Americans in the middle-late years of the 20th century is simply stunning. I've yet to come across a character in any of his novels that are cardboard cutouts of the characters they are portraying, and in this sad tale of two black families in New York City during the early '60s, you feel like you are sitting in the homes of these people as their tragedy is played out.This is the third Baldwin book I've read in the past year - I've thoroughly enjoyed all three. Amongst my well-read friends, however, Baldwin is an unknown and unread author. I hope the small sample size of my world is an anomaly, and that this talented writer is read the world over and not fading into a library's treasures hidden in plain sight.",en

Fonny looks the wrong way at the wrong cop, and the next thing you know his body is in jail for rape. He's innocent, but what does that have to do with anything?You know how in a romantic comedy, you have these characters that ought to be together but some sort of dramatic contrivance or misunderstanding is introduced to keep them apart?Top seven reasons stars get crossed7. Wrong sides of tracks6. She dead5. Siblings4. Are married to dudes who are bffs and suspect nothing3. He's a drummer who vapes2. She's a teenager and he's like 501. A racist system that incarcerates him for looking at the wrong cop on the wrong day.And just like that, Fonny and Tish, at the very first step of their lives together, are torn apart.There's no better writer in the 20th century than James Baldwin, so even his minor work is incredibly good, but this is a minor work. It's didactic, is the major problem: there's a lot of Furious Stylesish exposition. A third act trip to Puerto Rico doesn't fit that well, either; it's a good story but it makes the book flow weird. And there are a few...period touches that are jarring. History hasn't aged gracefully. Tish does a lot of drinking while pregnant, is what I'm saying. The scene where the two families meet to announce that they're now bound through Tish's pregnancy, and what are they going to do about it...Fonny's mother and sisters are sortof fun in their outlandish cartoon villain way, but a touch of domestic violence doesn't make the point it thinks it's making. We've finally caught up to what Baldwin was pointing out in 1974 - that the mass incarceration of black men amounts to a new Jim Crow, an entire system still devoted to destroying black families - and here comes the movie version of this book, out right now by the Moonlight guy. It's probably super good and I bet he leaves that domestic violence scene right out. Maybe he'll change the method of starcrossing, too. Like, maybe it's just, his bookstore buys her bookstore or whatever. This plot is kindof a bummer.I started a playlist but it fizzled out, but here it is. It's got the song that inspired the title, a song mentioned in the book, and then Meek Mill's brilliant ""Intro,"" recorded just after he got out of jail for some bullshit. The idea was to put a bunch more rap songs by African-American people who've been thrown in jail for bullshit, but I couldn't think of any off the top of my head and whatever. No, you do not need to suggest Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos, it doesn't technically fit my theme.",en

81,38463,2653403172,it was amazing," At the center of Baldwin’s critique on the universality of oppression and pain is a love story that is both delicate and bold in its attempt to fight a system that would keep people of color from receiving the dignity they deserve. Through Tish, Baldwin has created not only a living breathing entity, that is so familiar you could mistake her for your own sister, but also a swirling metaphor for the power that earnest love can have on shaping the world around us and birthing the hope we all need to continue our fight for freedom. In addition this novel serves as a frank commentary on how imperfect people can be seen perfectly through the eyes of someone who knows them so intimately that they are, as Baldwin puts it, “one body”. Tish expresses at one point that “it’s a miracle to realize that somebody loves you” and through the lives of all of these characters we get to see just exactly how much of a miracle love can be, especially when, against all odds, it is the only thing you have to hang on to.",en
82,38463,2535180495,it was amazing,"A literatura sempre foi uma arma poderosa. Sempre teve o poder de nos transportar para as suas narrativas, fazendo-nos vestir a pele dos seus protagonistas e viver todas as suas experiências e emoções em primeira mão. No que toca ao género romance, este existe para todos os gostos, mas por norma tenho sempre preferência por dois tipos: o indefinido, em que tanto a estrutura como a história fogem ao parâmetro tradicional, e aqueles elevam a fasquia, mostrando-me realidades que de outra maneira me seriam desconhecidas. O que para mim também é fundamental é que estes dois ramos do romance partilhem uma intensidade que vai para além da história de amor tradicional, arrebatando-nos brutalmente. Se esta rua falasse, de James Baldwin, pertence ao segundo ramo de que falei e proporcionou-me uma experiência tão enriquecedora quanto sofrida. Publicado pela primeira vez em 1974, este romance ilustra-nos uma situação peculiar. Um rapaz, Fonny, negro que é falsamente acusado de violação. A narrar-nos a história temos a sua namorada, Tish, também ela negra, que descobre que está grávida enquanto Fonny está na prisão. Entre o presente e o passado, vamos conhecendo melhor a história deste casal, mas acima de tudo vamos tendo uma clara imagem das diferenças de condições e de tratamentos para aqueles que os chamados brancos e para a aqueles que são negros. Não que o romance seja um confronto entre ambas as facções. Na minha opinião estamos perante um romance abismal sobre o amor, não deixando de parte a violência e a repressão inerente à situação.O belo de Se esta rua falasse, incide precisamente nessa força avassaladora que é o amor, descrevendo-o na inocência e simplicidade na relação entre Tish e Fonny, mas também descrevendo-o na força motriz necessária para se lutar por aqueles que amamos. Até onde estamos dispostos a ir para provar a inocência de alguém que nos é querido quando sabemos que a probabilidade de também se ficar em perigo é grande? Todo este romance é grandioso. Existe uma sensação de vertigem enquanto vivemos o amor, o medo, o sofrimento e o êxtase - tudo isto cabe neste pequeno grande romance - de cada um dos personagens. A sensação de injustiça e a incredulidade de ser relembrada que estas situações ainda hoje em dia são recorrentes só são aplacadas pela mestria de Baldwin ao atirar-nos à cara um romance extremamente humano, brutal e enternecedor. Tendo menos de duas centenas de páginas, sinto que poderia falar aqui sobre muito do que li eternamente. Desde a cena no mercado em que tudo realmente começou entre Fonny e o polícia que o prendeu, à primeira visita na prisão, a irmã de Tish, o pai de Fonny, a união da família de Tish em contraste com a divisão na família de Fonny devido a uma cegueira religiosa, as descrições nas águas furtadas entre Fonny e Tish (quase poéticas), a coragem da mãe de Tish, o advogado que só para o final subiu na consideração... E depois aquele final. Ensurdecedor e mortalmente silencioso ao mesmo tempo. Ficará, sem dúvida, marcado como um dos romances do ano publicados em Portugal. ",pt
83,38463,2490686617,it was amazing,"When it comes to writing a review for this, I prefer to share a small afterword as I prefer to let Baldwin's words speak rather than mine.""I sat on the hassock, leaning on Daddy's knee. Now, it was seven o'clock and the streets were full of noises. I felt very quiet after my long day, and my baby began to be real to me. I don't mean that it hadn't been real before; but, now, in a way, I was alone with it. Sis had left the lights very low. She put on a Ray Charles record and sat on the sofa.I listened to the music and the sounds from the streets and Daddy's hand rested lightly on my hair. And everything seemed connected--the street sounds, and Ray's voice and his piano and my Daddy's hand and my sister's silhouette and the sounds and the lights coming from the kitchen. It was as though we were a picture, trapped in time: this had been happening for hundreds of years, people sitting in a room, waiting for dinner, and listening to the blues. And it was as though, out of these elements, this patience, my Daddy's touch, the sounds of my mother in the kitchen, the way the light fell, the way the music continued beneath everything, the movement of Ernestine's head as she lit a cigarette, the movement of her hand as she dropped the match into the ashtray, the blurred human voices rising from the street, out of this rage and a steady, somehow triumphant sorrow, my baby was slowly being formed. I wondered if it would have Fonny's eyes. As someone had wondered, not, after all, so very long ago, about the eyes of Joseph, my father, whose hand rested on my head. What struck me suddenly, more than anything else, was something I knew but hadn't looked at: this was Fonny's baby and mine, we had made it together, it was both of us. I didn't know either of us very well. What would both of us be like? But this, somehow, made me think of Fonny and made me smile. My father rubbed his hand over my forehead. I thought of Fonny's touch, of Fonny, in my arms, his breath, his touch, his odor, his weight, that terrible and beautiful presence riding into me and his breath being snarled, as if by a golden thread, deeper and deeper in his throat as he rode--as he rode deeper and deeper not so much into me as into a kingdom which lay just behind his eyes. He worked on wood that way. He worked on stone that way. If I had never seen him work, I might never have known he loved me.It's a miracle to realize that somebody loves you.""He was such an amazing writer. I have to space his works out, year by year, so I can enjoy what he has left to offer. After reading 'The Fire This Time', I was first brought into his world, the life he led, the life many people still lead. Secondly, I read 'Giovanni's Room' where I was introduced to his fictional prowess and couldn’t put the book down. Thirdly, was ‘Another Country’; I thought the first part of the book may have been some of the best writing I’ve ever read.

84,38463,1821445244,it was amazing,"""One of the most terrible, most mysterious things about a life is that a warning can be heeded only in retrospect: too late."" That this novel, first published in 1974, rings so true 43 years later, is an indicator that James Baldwin is indeed correct: the life of the black man in America is marked by constant belated warnings that leave our previous brothers marked as a target for the corrupt justice system that is intent on shackling us or killing us, or both. The emotional center of everything that Baldwin has ever written is rage, and this novel is no different. He uses the novel in the same way that he uses his masterfully written essays: to plumb the depths of the human psyche, excavating all of the inner contradictions that are essentially what makes us human. He unapologetically critiques this country's racist foundations and through it all, manages to write in a beautiful style that could never be duplicated by any other writer. While this novel is not as lyrical and evocative, or even as imaginative as what I consider Baldwin's two masterpieces--Giovanni's Room and Just Above My Head--to be, I must give a 5 star rating because of his ability to so beautifully tell a story of real human beings faced with obstacles that, against all odds, must be confronted and demolished, despite the throbbing anguish that the characters feel.

85,38463,2573048154,it was amazing,"James Baldwin é considerado um dos escritores americanos mais importantes do século XX, a que se junta a sua importância como ativista dos direitos civis; encontrava-se, até agora, sem qualquer livro seu traduzido em Portugal, mas em boa hora a Alfaguara decidiu apostar na sua obra.Se esta rua falasse é um romance breve, com menos de 200 páginas, mas nem por isso deixa menor marca no leitor. Através de uma narrativa na primeira pessoa pela voz de Tish, uma jovem negra de 19 anos, conhecemos sua relação com Fonny, de 21, desde crianças até aos grandes desafios que enfrentam no presente. Através de constantes recuos ao passado das suas infâncias e a um passado mais recente, o leitor rapidamente de familiariza com a bonita história de amor dos dois, num texto que se destaca pela sua singela sensibilidade e pela forma aparentemente simples como relata um amor que parece capaz de vencer todos os obstáculos.É certo que a linguagem do amor é algo universal e que o amor entre dois negros não será diferente de qualquer outro, mas ao colocar as personagens na Nova Iorque do início dos anos 1970, a relação de Tish e Fonny é inevitavelmente condicionada pelas repressões raciais ainda existentes, que ameaçam o futuro risonho sonhado por ambos.Ainda que James Baldwin nos mostre situações que marcam pela revolta que suscitam no leitor, achei Se esta rua falasse um livro muito otimista. Não só porque as personagens principais se valem do seu amor para enfrentarem os tempos mais difíceis, mas porque existe um vívido sentimento de família, amizade e comunidade, que nos fazem ter a esperança que o final desejado chegará.Apesar da história cativante e interessante, aquilo de que mais gostei neste livro foi, sem dúvida, a prosa de James Baldwin. Há uma mistura de contenção e de sabedoria nas suas palavras, na forma como descreve o amor, a vida e todos os sentimentos pelo meio, que não podem deixar de falar ao coração de quem o lê. Por tudo isto, não posso deixar de recomendar este livro. Muito bom!
Não adianta tentar compreender este mistério, tão longe de ser simples como de ser seguro. Não sabemos o suficiente sobre nós mesmos. Acho que é melhor sabermos que não sabemos, porque assim podemos crescer com o mistério, à medida que o mistério cresce dentro de nós. Mas, por estes dias, toda a gente sabe tudo, e é por isso que tanta gente anda tão perdida.

Quando duas pessoas se amam, quando realmente se amam, tudo o que acontece entre elas tem algo de sacramental. Por vezes pode parecer que se afastam muito uma da outra: não conheço maior tormento, nem vazio mais retumbante. Quando quem amas desaparece! Mas esta noite, com os nossos votos tão misteriosamente ameaçados, e os dois postos diante desse facto, embora de ângulos diferentes, estávamos mais profundamente juntos do que alguma vez estivéramos antes.

86,38463,1868852685,really liked it,"I usually don't say that a book is unput-downable, because in my limited reading experience I have found very few books have been unput-downable. But here I am, late in the morning, waking up after unexpectedly finishing this book last night, having picked it up for a few more pages of progress before going to sleep, and then having been kept awake by the growing sense of unease and frustration until finally I finished it, turning that final electronic page, and feeling far from relieved by what I read, far from able to sleep, but exhausted because it was 4am.It is frustrating, I imagine, for people of colour in the most-free United States of America, to read this book, turn to its year of copyright, and discover that it is still, after more than 40 years, so goddamned relevant and so goddamned honest and ringing with so much goddamned truth. It was frustrating for me, a white Canadian, to watch the injustice in this story to develop, to know more and more the webs that made it possible, how deep they are, and how pointedly, carefully, and directly lies the blame in the heart of a single, red haired, blue-eyed, white-skinned human being with a dick, and badge, and a chip on his shoulder. This is a heart-breaking work.But, and I suspect this is true in ways that I don't yet know as a writer, it is most heart-breaking because it is most outrageously beautiful. The characters, their relationships, their love for each other and their hopes for the future. It is here, captured remarkably well, in language that would make even F. Scott Fitzgerald jealous for its sultry combination of sadness and sweet sweet romance. The microaggressions of love, layed out from one character to the next, love known and felt and acknowledged and reciprocated. Love being hurt by a loved one being hurt, altered, changed, broken, and still, amazingly, remaining beautifully strong.James Baldwin is damned good as a writer, but I don't think he wrote this book for me - he certainly had no reason to believe I would be reading it. No, this book is for the people about which it is written. And you can tell this by seeing his language, by seeing the ways in which he reminds these people that they are beautiful, remarkable, outrageous and bountiful humanity caught in, as they are well aware, a nation infested with the deeply burrowed maggots of racism. But this book is expertly written, and so I could read it, I could understand it just well enough, to not only recognize the horrifying dissonance of the black life in America - the one in which you are treated as an incomplete form of humanity while you and the small world of other black bodies that you are in know the contrary is entirely true - but to, beyond recognition, actually get a sense, for an instant or two, for less than 200 hundred pages, just what that dissonance can feel like, just how deeply it can cut, just how closely you can feel the freedoms and rights which don't exist, just how much hope there must be in a future of liberty. This book is a reminder of the dignity found in those who have been and are being oppressed, those who are looking for ways to survive despite all the forces working against them, and of the dignity bound up in hope and in family and in love. Just in case you didn't know it, just in case you've ever doubted it, just in case you have ever wondered what it could possibly mean, read this book, because #BlackLivesMatter, and this book has made that ringing truth even more real for me. Thank you Mr. James Baldwin. I'll be back to read more of you.",en

Was it really real,or did my mind make this all up,and if it did, why?And the book began blasé like that,like an old record that had lost its beat.But then Baldwin found his Voicewhen Tish and Fonny madebeautiful love,which must have been his own aphrodisiac, because his writing came Alive.But the sex and the vulgaritywere all too much for me,well, maybe it wasn’t the sexbut the vulgarity in every definitionof the word.I wanted to put the book away, and I believed that the injustices in their world would ruin their lives forever anyway.Tish was the woman who loved that man, Foony, who then had a baby by him, a man who was now in prison waiting for his trial. And they really couldn’t afford a lawyer, nor could they afford to live in the Housing Projects, which were horrible anyway, and reminded me of what I had read about tenant housing in New York when immigrants first came to America. Rats, cockroaches. I have known people who lived in houses like this, and whether they rented or owned, that was just how they lived. I was invited for breakfast one morning by a woman who lived across the street from us in Fresno. I walked into her kitchen and sat down. Under my feet was an indoor/outdoor carpet filled with old dried food, maybe even some fresh; it didn’t matter which, because the smell was enough to make you gag. The filth was everywhere. And on the walls, the counters, and the stove, cockroaches were doing a fearless slow waltz through her kitchen. I sat there eating my breakfast watching it all, and when I finished eating, I returned no more. And she never even realized that her living conditions were deplorable. This book was like that, and you have to have the stomach for it too. Only Tish and Fonny knew that by living in America their lives were deplorable; they knew that much.Note: Beale Street isn’t in Harlem where the story is set. It is in Memphis, Tennessee, but maybe by bringing the two together Baldwin’s was being artsy or was saying that all black streets were the same.Tidbit: If Beale Street could talk it would tell you go have lunch at the King’s Palace, because they have the best breaded fried green tomatoes and crab cakes. Then you may wish to go find some blues music, maybe at B.B. King’s. I hear that they serve good food too.",en

It was one of my favourite films of that year and I was thrilled that it won the Oscar for Best Picture a few months later – after Warren Beatty finally opened the right envelope! Jenkins new film is an adaptation of James Baldwin's “If Beale Street Could Talk” and I'm really looking forward to seeing it. But I always try to read a book before seeing the film version and I've been meaning to read more of Baldwin's writing for a long time. In college I read “Go Tell It on the Mountain”, “Giovanni's Room” and “Another Country” but I've not read anything since then. Somehow I forgot how forthright and emotional Baldwin's fiction is because I think this novel is absolutely extraordinary. “If Beale Street Could Talk” is narrated by nineteen year old Tish who has become pregnant by her fiancé Fonny who she's been close to most of her life. They've found their own place to live in Harlem and received a blessing from Tish's father to marry, but their plans collapse when Fonny is falsely accused of rape and imprisoned. Both their families try to pull together to get Fonny out of this dire situation, but they encounter many obstacles due to economic disadvantages and institutionalised racism.

90,38463,2063074537,really liked it,"Within a minute of finding out Barry Jenkins would be adapting this book, I put it on hold at the library. I usually like to read a book and then have some space before seeing the film version so this should work out nicely. I've also had an itch to read more Baldwin ever since seeing I AM NOT YOUR NEGRO earlier this year. This is my 5th Baldwin book and every time I read one I am mad at myself for not having read them all yet. He is a wonder. And not just his nonfiction, which gets more attention these days. I find his fiction beautiful, compelling, and unique. He has this momentum, this rhythm, this speed that moves the story forward with power and grace. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK is a story set in the context of a racist justice system and what it is like to be young and black in that world, how there is so much fear and so much hope simultaneously. Tish and Fonny are young, in love, and getting married until everything is upended and Fonny is arrested for a crime he didn't commit. When the novel begins all of this has already happened and Tish has just found out she's pregnant. It is an impossible task for her to visit Fonny as much as she can, to help keep his spirits up, to give him something to look forward to, but not have any real power to help him. Much of the book is set in simple domestic scenes, Tish talking to her family, Tish talking to Fonny, despite its big issues it is a quiet book. It also, thankfully, is not trying to hit you over the head to make its points about racism and injustice, it simply lets these characters be, lets you feel their pain, lets you want so badly for the world to be a different place for them. There's a lot of Baldwin left for me to get to, and clearly I need to make that a priority.",en
91,38463,1966342181,really liked it,"I decided to reread If Beale Street Could Talk in anticipation of its movie adaptation hitting cinemas in Germany next week. I first read it back in April 2017, and already forgot much about the plot and outcome of the story. Now, as I did back then, I managed to read this wonderful novel within one day. Spanning only 197 pages that’s not the biggest achievement, but still: there aren’t many authors who can captivate me and keep my attention like Baldwin does. If Beale Street Could Talk is, as of right now, my favorite work of his; not least of all because it had an unmatched sense of urgency and relevancy to it. The novel was written (if not revised for publication) by Baldwin in the 1950s, but ultimately published in 1974. It centers around the loving relationship between 19-year-old Tish and 22-year-old Fonny, and their struggle for justice as Fonny is put into jail for raping a Puerto Rican woman – a crime he didn’t commit. The only Black man in a police line-up, he is ""identified"" by the distraught, confused woman, whose testimony is partly shaped by a white policeman. His fiancee, Tish, is pregnant; the fact of her pregnancy is, at times, all that keeps them from utter despair. The two of them grew up in the same run-down Black neighborhood in New York City, and fell in love in their late teens. Through flashbacks, Baldwin shows us their childhood and how they navigated through America, whilst inhabiting a Black body. The psychological aspect of racial segregation is the focus of this tale. How can Fonny become a man, when society denies him exactly that? We see children go to the dogs, waste away their lives on drugs, sell their bodies for some cash … It is not easy to keep your head up high and your morale intact when your possibilities in life are being purposefully limited. It is not easy to love, to truly love, in an environment like that. But somehow Tish and Fonny have found one another and they cling to each other to remain sane.
I know. But I know some hustles and you know some hustles and these are our children and we got to set them free.
The reason I love this novel so much is the way in which Baldwin shows us the variety of family dynamics that shaped these two young adults in their rawest form. Tish has a great support system and can always lean on her mother, father and older sister. They are there for her through it all, through Fonny’s imprisonment, her pregnancy; they somehow find a way to make life bearable. Fonny’s family, however, is another matter entirely. His father Frank is trying his best to support his son, but he is lost, has succumbed to alcohol and cannot count on his wife for support. Fonny’s light-skinned sisters have got it into their head to get out of the ghetto, and being there for their dark-skinned imprisoned brother won’t help them with that. As accusations fly and the families fight, Baldwin’s language oozes contempt and harshness. This novel is not for the faint of heart. It is tense and offensive and difficult … and ultimately, a forthright account of what it meant to be Black in America in the 1950s.
“I have been in America a long time,” she says. “I hope I do not die here.”
As I mentioned before, I rarely read a novel that had such a sense of urgency to it. And even the second time around, I kept turning the pages because I needed to know if they would be able to get Fonny out of prison, if Tish would have enough strength to bring their baby into the world, if the families would somehow be able to reconcile … so many questions, so many wounds that Baldwin tore open with his writing, it’s nearly impossible to extract yourself from it. I am incredibly happy that If Beale Street Could Talk features so many strong Black women. In the past, I have been frustrated with Baldwin’s lack of care for his female characters or his blatant ignorance when it comes to the plight of Women of Color (if you’re interested in that, read his interview with Audre Lorde), but Beale Street reads almost like a love letter to Black women, their strength and resilience to push through hardships like nobody else. 
I know I can't help you very much right now – God knows what I wouldn't give if I could. But I know about suffering; if that helps. I know that it ends. I ain't going to tell you no lies, like it always ends for the better. Sometimes it ends for the worse. You can suffer so bad that you can be driven to a place where you can't ever suffer again: and that's worse. […] I know that a lot of our loved ones, a lot of our men, have died in prison: but not all of them. You remember that.
As the men in the family quickly despair over Fonny’s hopeless situation, Tish’s mom Sharon keeps the family together and does everything in her power to support her daughter, she even travels to Puerto Rico to confront the woman who has accused Fonny of raping her. Tish’s sister Ernestine is honestly my favorite character in this whole entire novel. She’s tough and intense and wonderful, and a true lioness when it comes to protecting her sister from harm. Ernestine truly is the one who keeps the whole investigation running, constantly pushing Fonny’s lawyer to make sure he’s doing his utmost to get Fonny out of jail. And Tish herself is a remarkable woman, too; all the times in which Fonny despaired and had to lean on her and she took it all with such grace, even though she, too, was feeling like shit. Absolutely admirable! If Beale Street Could Talk is a moving and painful story. It is so vividly human and so obviously based upon reality, that it strikes us as timeless. A novel that is nearly impossible to put down; it's been a long time since I felt that an author's message was so urgent, so important, so deserving of being heard.",en
92,38463,2670838972,it was amazing,"If Beale Street Could Talk is sublime. For those who saw the movie, not everything in the novel stays the same, there are some scenes that I assume were cut for time. I thought that the way this ended was pretty perfect though.This book is told from the POV of 18 year old Tish. She is dealing with the effects of her fiancee Fonny being locked up after he was accused of rape. You think that this would be simple until you read the long winding road that led them to this point. Tish's voice in this story is strong. Through her we get to see her first look at Fonny when they were kids and when they became something more. You get her frustration with how things are right now. And you get how she loves him. More than that, you get to see how Tish's family loves her. Her mother, father, and sister end up being Fonny's family too. We also get a look at Fonny's family and his two sisters, mother, and father. There could have been a whole other book about them. Every one that appears in this book is fully developed though. I don't know how long it has been that I read something that I could say well that was great, this person is great, and I can see this person in my head. Baldwin doesn't tell this story in a linear fashion, but it works. We go from the past (when Tish and Fonny met) her remembering the first time they went to church, and then back in the present with her telling her family that she is pregnant. And then we jump back again to see how happy Tish and Fonny were before they had a night that changed everything. The writing isn't lyrical. It is raw and in your face. “Tish,” she said, “when we was first brought here, the white man he didn’t give us no preachers to say words over us before we had our babies. And you and Fonny be together right now, married or not, wasn’t for that same damn white man. So, let me tell you what you got to do. You got to think about that baby. You got to hold on to that baby, don’t care what else happens or don’t happen. You got to do that.“Unbow your head, sister,” she said, and raised her glass and touched mine. “Save the children,” she said, very quietly, and drained her glass.That baby was our baby, it was on its way, my father’s great hand on my belly held it and warmed it: in spite of all that hung above our heads, that child was promised safety.“I don’t know,” Frank said, “how God expects a man to act when his son is in trouble. Your God crucified His son and was probably glad to get rid of him, but I ain’t like that. I ain’t hardly going out in the street and kiss the first white cop I see. But I’ll be a very loving motherfucker the day my son walks out of that hellhole, free. I’ll be a loving motherfucker when I hold my son’s head between my hands again, and look into his eyes. Oh! I’ll be full of love, that day!”The flow of this book was perfect. At times I was smiling, in tears, or full of despair, or hope. Baldwin puts you through the ringer. You want Tish and Fonny to have a different end to their story, but we all know what the end is going to be, what is has to be when you are talking about two black kids in love in the 1970s in America. Heck, have things changed? Baldwin shows you colorism, racism, sexism, police brutality, and one wonders have we come far enough? The setting of If Beale Street Could Talk is New York in the 1970s. You get to see how hard it was/is for a black man and a black woman at that time. The ending is left with us waiting for a new life even though we know that the life that Tish wanted is now gone.

93,38463,2557586253,it was amazing," Few authors can really pull my heartstrings using romance but man this one was freaking brilliant! “Neither love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind.”I can't believe it took me this long to get acquainted with Baldwin's prose... Finished this over the weekend and I'm still staring at the wall dumbfounded that I just experienced one of the most heartfelt love stories and I am not one who typically gravitates towards romance ?.Set in Harlem New York we Follow the love story of Fonny and Tish who at the beginning of the narrative are torn apart as we find out Fonny is being falsely accused of a heinous crime and Tish discovers she's pregnant. We dip into their past love affair whilst exploring the crippling effect of the justice system against African Americans, Family relationships, mental illness and so much more..The writing was mesmerizing, the dialogue brought the characters to life. He tackled topics effortlessly... Current social issues like Black Lives Matter movement are still not tackled, years after this was published, really made me stop and think. Some scenes still replay in my head because even though the narrative sounds bleak it had some heart at the center of the story. I laughed, I was moved and I'm definitely excited to continue this literary love affair with Baldwin. ( Looking out for Giovanni's Room ).One of my favorite passage
“Being in trouble can have a funny effect on the mind. I don't know if I can explain this. You go through some days and you seem to be hearing people and you seem to be talking to them and you seem to be doing your work, or, at least, your work gets done; but you haven't seen or heard a soul and if someone asked you what you have done that day you'd have to think a while before you could answer. But at the same time, and even on the self-same day-- and this is what is hard to explain--you see people like you never saw them before.”

95,38463,515698036,really liked it,"I love James Baldwin. I don't think I need to explain what a talented writer he is; however, there were parts of this book that I felt were a bit melodramatic. That could just be me. There's an argument that takes place between a few people that seemed to get a little crazy in my opinion. Other than that I enjoyed this book and so much of it is recognizable in a present-day context. There are still police officers like the ones in this book, the prison industrial complex still affects black men at unreasonable rates, and there are still families stuck in a cycle of poverty. I find that James Baldwin's work is usually timeless because, unfortunately, race-relations in America improve very slowly. What I enjoy about Baldwin is his unwillingness to sugar-coat anything while still remaining captivating. I appreciate his ability to use characters as vehicles for his thoughts without losing sight of who they are. You always get the feeling that Baldwin is speaking to you through his characters but it never seems like a wild case of writer-on-board syndrome. For example, Aaron Sorkin, sometimes appears to be working out his issues through his characters. No shade to Sorkin. Love him but sometimes it is so plainly obvious when a character stops being himself and starts being Sorkin. I don't get that from Baldwin whose characters may act as mouthpieces but remain fully fleshed and distinctive.",en

A year and a half earlier, if somebody would have come to me with the askance for it, I would have certainly tormented my guts out. However, had that person been James Baldwin, things would have taken a different turn.Love is revolutionary and so are the people who know how to love. There are no barriers known to love, even if it is surmounted by palpable pain. 
If Beale Street Could Talk
 is a moving story of love in the face of injustice and hopelessness. It has conflicts, both internal and external. It is intensely intimate. Halfway through the novel, I had no idea why things are the way it were. I didn't know why Alonzo Hunt was in prison. Now that I have finished reading it, I don't know what to do with myself. This is the same dreary world where love exists. As Baldwin puts it, 
""It's a miracle to realize that somebody loves you.""

Gone With the Wind

The Fountainhead

101,38463,2673269765,really liked it,"Boeken moeten veel geduld hebben. Van James Baldwin ‘Giovanni’s room’ was ik ondersteboven toen ik het in 1984 las. En daarna duurde het maar liefst vijfendertig jaar voor ik weer bij Baldwin terechtkwam, om opnieuw behoorlijk overdonderd te zijn.Gisteren heb ik de laatste bladzijde van ‘Als Beale Street kon praten’ omgeslagen, en ik dacht dat ik gisteravond al aan een nieuw boek ging kunnen beginnen, maar daarvoor was het te vroeg. Het verhaal van de negentienjarige Tish en haar vriend Fonny wilde niet verstoord worden. Kauw hier nog maar even op, zei mijn hoofd.De nasmaak van ‘Als Beale Street kon praten’ is — ondanks de liefde en de snelheid en de passie en de humor — wrang. Ik moet namelijk niet alleen het verhaal van Tish verteren, die samen met haar familie uit alle macht probeert om de valselijk van verkrachting beschuldigde Fonny uit de gevangenis te krijgen. Door ‘I Am Not Your Negro’, de door James Baldwin geschreven documentaire die ik een halfjaar geleden zag, kan ik dit boek nog beter in de juiste, ontluisterende context plaatsen.De documentaire die ik hierboven noem schetst het racisme in de Verenigde Staten via de herinneringen die Baldwin heeft aan goeie vrienden en voorvechters als Malcolm X en Martin Luther King Jr. Door die beelden en die informatie zie ik, als ik Baldwins boek lees, niet alleen het New York van Aretha Franklin, maar ook de rauwe realiteit waar de zwarte Tish en Fonny zich in bevinden.‘Als Beale Street kon praten’ is uit het Engels vertaald door Harm Damsma.Barry Jenkins, die naam maakte met de prachtige film ‘Moonlight’, heeft zijn nieuwe film op Baldwins boek gebaseerd. Dit is de trailer van de film die dit jaar in de zalen komt: www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4m3t3G3Zqc.

103,38463,2480911230,it was amazing,"Actual rating: 4.5Over the course of 197 pages, my heart was broken, warmed, and stitched back up. It is a bruised thing now; beating hot blood, but with the soft pain of being reminded that life (and especially the lives of people of color) can so often be f*cking unfair.The story as a whole is a necessary one— there were many emotions that it stirred up in me, and I haven’t read many books lately that can manage to make me feel so much all in one. This is a pretty short book, and the fact that I felt so strongly for Tish, Fonny, Sharon, Ernestine, Joseph, Frank, and even some of the barely-there side characters, is the work of a true master.A particular note I feel I must make: Tish has one of the most remarkable, supportive families I’ve ever read in literature. I love her mother. I love her sister. I love her father. The lengths they go to (or would go to) for each other is profoundly moving. I fear for them, and I want to hope for them. Everything in the story felt so based-in-reality, and that's frightening, because you want to see your beloved characters overcome and be happy, but the circumstances of life don't always raise you up so much as saddle to your back a conveyor belt of tribulations. And even after EVERYTHING, the language of the novel is a hopeful one: the final message is not one of despair, but resilience.James Baldwin has created a world full of saints and monsters, that also just so happens to be a ‘far-from-simply-fiction’ 1970’s New York. It is at once both a terrible reality— a reminder of ignorance, hate, and injustice— and a life-affirming look at love, family, and hope.",en
104,38463,2646281279,really liked it,"This was my first book of Baldwin's. Knowing I wanted to see the movie, I figured reading this beforehand would be a good place to start.I want to preface this by saying that I writing this is difficult for me. As a white woman writing a review of a book written by an AOC about POC, I want to acknowledge that my perspective is different and there might be things I missed. In fact, I do feel like I missed something because I wasn't as emotionally invested in Tish and Fonnie's relationship as I thought I would to be.One of the things that impressed me the most was that a man was able to write from a woman's point of view and do it so incredibly well. I also loved Tish's family -- they came alive on the page for me, probably more than anything else in the book. I loved how fiercely they all supported Tish, how dedicated they were to getting Fonnie out of prison, and how they stood up for themselves against Fonnie's family (particularly his mothers and sisters).Maybe the length is part of what made it hard for me to feel connected to the story -- at just under 200 pages it's a pretty quick read. However, Baldwin does a great job of packing in a lot of different emotions, the biggest one I felt while reading was tension between Tish and Fonnie's families, in Tish herself as she grapples with what might happen, and with Fonnie as he wrestles with the injustice of being wrongly imprisoned.I'll admit that before writing this review (but after reading the book) I saw the movie, and I felt much more connected to the characters (especially Fonnie) after seeing it. I won't say much more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but I highly recommend reading the book and then following it up with the movie.Overall I found Baldwin's writing to be beautiful and was moved by the injustice of what happened to them. I also appreciated this portrayal of black romance (in some ways it was reminiscent of An American Marriage -- or I should say that in hindsight, An American Marriage felt reminiscent of this), something that has been lacking in my reading life (and something that I will be intentionally seeking out more of). One of the biggest takeaways for me was just how little has changed in the 40+ years since this story was written and just how far we have to go for black people to truly be treated as equal in this country.",en
105,38463,866583648,really liked it,"If Beale Street Could TalkJames BaldwinThe protagonist, Clementine (Tish) Rivers is nineteen (19) when she starts to narrate about her recent visit to see her fiancé Alonzo (Fonny) Hunt, in jail. Fonny is twenty-two (22) and has known Tish since they were, nine (9) and six (6), respectively. The story takes place in the 1950’s in New York City. Both Tish and Fonny are African-American and live in Harlem.The story deals primarily with issues of family, race, and criminal justice.Tish’s family is very supportive of her and her choices. She grow up with both parents in the home and has an older sister. Tish seemed to have had a normal childhood. She was a virgin until about age eighteen (18) or nineteen (19), when she and Fonny first made love in his loft.Fonny’s family is dysfunctional and his mother and two sisters don’t support him, even in his incarceration. Fonny also grow up with both parents in the home. His mother a self-certified holy roller had many unchristian like ideas and tendencies.Fonny had a run-in with a racist white police who eventually arrested him for the rape of a Puerto Rican women. Fonny was innocent of the rape, although he was picked out in a line-up by the victim. The victim had indicated that she was raped by a black man.Fonny’s lawyer was white and appeared to have work hard for his client. He noted that the cop that arrested Fonny was a racist and had already killed one black youth. Further, he found out that the line-up was a set-up that only included one black man. This had the appearance of pointing to Fonny, since he was the only black man in the line-up.The rape victim returned to Puerto Rico. In the story Tish’s mother goes there to try to get her to come back to the U.S. for the trial. It was the family’s hope that she would realize that Fonny was not the rapist. I don’t think that fact that this victim of rape was Puerto Rican was significant to the story. However, we did learn that she had many other challenges in her life. There are several victims in the story; Tish who is denied the boyfriend and father of her unborn child, Mrs. Victoria Rogers was raped, and Fonny who was incarcerated for a crime he did not commit.

110,38463,2656786919,it was amazing,"Beale Street doesn't speak and James Baldwin knew it and decided not to wait around for that to happen. It felt like it couldn't end well, because there are too many true stories like this, of a young man falsely accused, of families who strive to seek justice, who are destroyed by their efforts and yet.Here we have a young man Fonny and his girlfriend Tish, they're childhood sweethearts embarking on their young adult lives when he gets pulled into a lineup and accused of something he couldn't have done, by a system that cares nothing for justice, and worse, desires to crush men like him, a young man who has found his life's work, his passion and is about to embark on a new life with the woman he loves. Interestingly, Baldwin narrates this tale from Tish's perspective, which is almost a relief for the reader, for she had the solid foundation of a family that loves and protects her and wants to help Fonny, it feels like they are his family too, so solid is their support. Sharon, her mother, is a fabulous character, I loved her, how she grew from the shy young thing who left her drummer boyfriend to travel to New York, allowing Joseph to take care of her, the two of them creating that stronghold within which to raise their children. So in touch with her deepest roots, she is able to appease her daughter when when comes bearing news of her pregnancy:'Tish', she said, 'when we was first brought here, the white man he didn't give us no preachers to to say words over us before we had our babies. And you and Fonny be together right now, married or not, wasn't, wasn't for that same damn white man. So let me tell you what you got to do. You got to think about that baby. You got to hold onto that baby, don't care what else happens or doesn't happen. You got to do that. Can't nobody else do that for you. And the rest of us, well, we going to hold on to you. And we going to get Fonny out. Don't you worry. I know it's hard - but don't you worry. And that baby be the best thing that ever happened to Fonny. He needs that baby. It going to give a whole lot of courage.'Right there, the mother reinforces stability in their lives and I can't help but be aware of the contrast, having just read a memoir of a baby conceived within a culture that shame(s)d its daughters for pregnancy outside of wedlock, destroying lives, dividing families, creating unnecessary drama.Here, we have a family encountering difficult circumstances and yet their ability to be there for each other, sees them though and even Fonny is affected by this, nourished by this, even though he has moments of sliding down into a dark place. By contrast, his family is fragmented, the mother and daughters reject the offer of unity offered by Joseph and Sharon, the father Frank gets it and tries, but without the strength and force of an unconditional love/bond between them, he too is vulnerable.I've just seen that the movie is on at our local, and having been overcome by the way the novel ends, I'm not sure I could cope with seeing the movie. I was also surprised to read on the last page St Paul de Vence, October 12, 1973 and then remembered that James Baldwin lived here in France in his latter years, which makes the book all the more poignant, that the author could no longer support living in a country that was at the time so far from tolerating difference, unconventional love and minorities. Clearly his heart was still there though, as his writing took him back there every day.",en
111,38463,2662666292,really liked it,"""One of the most terrible, most mysterious things about a life is that a warning can be heeded only in retrospect: too late.""I'm tempted to just link you to Alex's review and be done with it, since he touches on most of what I want to say about this one and says it more concisely than I probably will, too. But I'll give it a try.There are few, if any, modern writers I admire more than James Baldwin, so anything negative I say about him still comes from a place of deep respect. But I'm afraid I have to get a little negative in this review, because judged against Baldwin's best work this one just doesn't stack up. Don't get me wrong—it's Baldwin, so it's still better than 95% of other books out there pretty much by default; but it's Baldwin, so that means the standard is pretty damn high.If Beale Street Could Talk is narrated in first person from the perspective of Tish, a 19-year-old black woman in Harlem, and at its core it's the story of her relationship with 22-year-old Fonny: her childhood friend, the love of her life, and the soon-to-be father of her child. He, Fonny, has recently been jailed for sexual assault pissing off a white cop, and it's up to Tish and her family to try and get him released. It's a worthy premise, just as infuriatingly relevant today as it would have been in 1974, and it's not hard to understand why Barry Jenkins wanted to put it on film. But at times it seems like Baldwin himself doesn't really feel like writing it. I've talked before about books that don't know what they want to be, and I got that feeling a lot while reading this one. The story will be trundling along just fine in Tish's POV, only to be stopped dead by a long authorial musing on The Fundamental Differences Between Men and Women or something similarly momentous and flow-disrupting. There's nothing better than top-form James Baldwin waxing poetic about the human condition, but here it too often feels self-indulgent, a lesson inserted by the author at the expense of the narrative itself. Some of the characters, too, fall into flatness and caricature, serving as little more than mouthpieces for that same sort of authorial speech-making, and (much as it pains me to say so about one of the master stylists of the 20th century) the book in general is kind of overwritten. Add in a few too many loose tangents and side episodes (at one point Tish treats us to a long description of Fonny's parents' foreplay ritual, a tidbit we're supposed to believe was supplied to her in loving detail by Fonny himself) and a page count just this side of novella-length, and what we're left with is a weird chimera of a book that has unmistakable flashes of Baldwinian brilliance but in the end feels like nothing so much as a draft for a longer, better novel he never finished writing.I guess that all sounds pretty damning, but like I said at the beginning, even the worst Baldwin still isn't bad. Tish and Fonny's relationship is tender and well-realized, a portrayal of black love which—while still confronted with a whole world of setbacks—is fundamentally resilient and ultimately triumphant (small and bittersweet though that triumph may be). Baldwin speaks truly and clearly about the injustices of America's police and prisons, about the enormous system that has been designed deliberately to ""keep [the damned] where they are,"" and unfortunately those truths still stand as they always have. There are scenes and passages I don't think I'll forget, and moments of deep humanity which have remained with me.One last thing: since I and many others are reading this one now specifically to get ready for the new movie, I don't think it's out of place to assure you that Barry Jenkins does a predictably brilliant job with this material. I'm not someone who believes a film adaptation has to mirror or even resemble the book it's based on, but I was impressed by how closely Jenkins hewed to Baldwin's vision; aside from a few tweaks at the end, it was practically a scene-by-scene retelling. Frankly I don't believe the book is always better, either, and I actually found this particular story more effective (and affecting) on screen than on the page. I hope plenty of people will see it, but I hope even more that it will bring lots of new readers to Baldwin's work—and that those readers won't stop with Beale Street.",en

Also, in the story, everything goes counter to what we would expect normally, even the end. Baldwin has caught the true reality of life, particularly of a young Afro-American man, exploited in the hands of white policemen. I came across this book accidentally, but its theme seems so relevant still today, particularly in the contexts of all those recent killings in America of young African-American men by white policemen that we see in the press. Two phrases moved me to tears: When Tish’s mother says toward the end, ‘Sufferings always end. It doesn’t get better necessarily, but it always ends.” The other place is, at the beginning, when Tish is returning after seeing Fonny, and she is feeling very weak, and Baldwin compares the lawyers and the bondmen to vultures circling over a dying man in the desert…that is just so accurate!!I really love the insights Baldwin has into life.

116,38463,915166776,it was amazing,"Because I came of age in the 1960s and because I was raised in a liberal family, I have always known about James Baldwin. Somehow though I had never read anything he wrote until I read Go Tell It On The Mountain, published in 1953, as part of my Big Fat Reading Project. By then I had read Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison and Alice Walker. I admire all of those authors immensely, but James Baldwin is in a class of his own.One of the greatest benefits of reading good fiction comes from authors who can make you know and feel and comprehend people you otherwise have not had much experience with before. I have not ever been racist as far as my beliefs and ideas go, but I have also had very little experience living side by side amongst African Americans. The huge talent of James Baldwin is his ability to make Black people burst out of all stereotypes and loom large as living, loving, feeling human beings. Anything I have ever felt about life has also been experienced by any African American but there is one thing I have only had glimpses of in my life and that is the degree of injustice an American black person must live with every minute of their existence. In this novel, James Baldwin brought that home to me.If Beale Street Could Talk makes this so clear and real because of the characters Baldwin created and the way he makes them talk. Tish, a 19-year-old woman, pregnant with her first child. Fonny, a 22-year-old sculptor, the father of the baby, who fully intends to marry Tish and care for her but is in jail for a crime he did not commit. The parents and siblings of these two who each react to the situation according to their own experiences of life in mid-20th century New York City.I loved every word, sentence, and page of what is one of the best love stories I've ever read. Of course one novel, no matter how great, cannot cure a person of racism. But I like to imagine a huge One Country One Book event during which the majority of literate American citizens read and discuss If Beale Street Could Talk.",en

I went into If Beale Street Could Talk with a bit of apprehension, as I didn't know what to expect. I've read enough of Baldwin's prose to know that I love his interpretation of the English language, but would it have a similarly compelling, understated plot like Giovanni's Room? Yes. Of course.If Beale Street Could Talk is the story of Fonny and Tish, Fonny's imprisonment, and Tish's pregancy. It is a story about relationships and loss, like Giovanni's Room. Yet, (maybe because of its later publication) Beale Street has characters that seem very much alive to me, in a way I hadn't experienced before with Baldwin. Please consider reading Baldwin if you haven't already.",en

[..] These captive men are the hidden price for a hidden and dreadful terror: the righteous must be able to locate the damned. To do much is to have the power and the necessity to dictate to the damned.”Set in early 1970s Harlem, this was a powerful look at the wider, very real, effects racism and systemic racism has on black families. Told through Tish’s perspective, we share in the heady days of her relationship with her childhood friend turned partner Fonny. She is pregnant with their first child, but as they plan for their future together, racism intervenes and Fonny ends up incarcerated. Their families struggle with the injustice, even as they try to cope and support the couple in their own ways. It makes for angry, painful reading, and even more so given the fact that this may be a work of fiction, but it could easily be truth - and maybe the realities of many black families in America. There is a lot of evidence to show that racial disparities exist in the American criminal justice system - compared to white people, black people (especially black males) are more likely to be stopped or brutalised by police, more likely to be arrested and incarcerated and for longer durations, more likely to be given life sentences or sentenced to death row. If Beale Street Could Talk was published in 1974 and yet, despite James Baldwin having written this novel way back when, these racial inequities have frustratingly persisted.",en

A heart-wrenching wailing cry for the lost youth, the dead children………………………
Baldwin at his best, concise, trim writing evoking the so beautiful love between Fonny and Tish and also the love of their family. To then see this love then sullied, tarnished by hate, injustice is a blow to the heart. The unbearable tension and tragedy of life on a knife’s edge, with no control over the way you’ll fall.

 This has left me so angry, so sad, so hopeless, in a dark place. I was aware before but this has reached in deep. (view spoiler)[because even if Fonny get's out on bail which I do hope. Things have changed, Frank is dead and they will have to carry all this with them together with the rest of their burdens the whole of their lives. Plus the continuous waiting to be taken to trail whenever the authorities please.

Baldwin captured that, and so much more about human relationships as well.

132,38463,2552397806,really liked it,"https://www.comunidadeculturaearte.co...Há muito que se clamava pela tradução das obras de James Baldwin para o português, uma lacuna no panorama editorial nacional. No entanto, ainda que seja possivelmente o mais importante escritor afro-americano do século XX, pensador da condição negra na América (com a particularidade de, ao mesmo tempo, combinar em si a dupla condição minoritária de ser negro e homossexual), até há uns poucos anos atrás mesmo nos Estados Unidos da América havia caído um pouco em esquecimento.Foram os fenómenos sociais a fazê-lo ressurgir. Numa altura em que a insurgência de movimentos como o Black Lives Matter, motivada pela violência policial para com afro-americanos, trazia a condição negra na América para o centro do debate, praticamente 30 anos após a sua morte Baldwin voltou a ser ouvido e a sua palavra novamente espalhada, não apenas pelas livrarias mas também pelo cinema, em ""I Am Not Your Negro"", documentário que Raoul Peck fez focando-se nas suas palavras.Esse documentário foi, aliás, instrumental para mostrar a falta que fazia a sua obra em Portugal, e acabou por ser, finalmente, a Alfaguara a editora a tomar a dianteira. Fê-lo, no entanto, com uma obra pouco expectável na obra do autor. A reboque de outra adaptação cinematográfica da obra de James Baldwin, a do seu romance ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" por Barry Jenkins, realizador de Moonlight, escolheu começar a publicação das obras de Baldwin não através de uma das suas obras mais conhecidas – ""Giovanni’s Room"" e ""Go Tell It On The Mountain"" na ficção, ""Notes of a Native Son"" nos ensaios -, mas por este ""Se Esta Rua Falasse"", um dos seus romances mais tardios.Ora, apesar de escrito enquanto vivia em Saint Paul de Vence, em 1974 (Baldwin viveu grande parte da sua vida quer em Paris quer nesta pequena vila no sul de França), ""Se Esta Rua Falasse"" é inegavelmente um romance do Harlem, num olhar a partir de fora para um problema que conhece bem dentro de si. Afinal, a condição de um negro na América não mudara muito desde que Baldwin se vira obrigado, para a própria sobrevivência, a abandonar a sua Nova Iorque natal para uma França que se lhe afigurava muito mais digna para alguém da sua condição. E da mesma maneira que essa ausência de melhorias motiva a escrita deste livro, é essa mesma resistência à mudança que lhe dá novo relevo mediático hoje, porque, mesmo passado tantas décadas desde este livro, a situação não se alterou assim tanto; afinal de contas, a população negra continua, por exemplo, a estar sobejamente sobre-representada nas prisões norte-americanas, e continuam a abundar os casos de negros desarmados alvejados pela polícia ou de assunção de culpa somente com base na cor de pele. Em ""Se Esta Rua Falasse"", Baldwin narra-nos precisamente uma dessas histórias que, infelizmente, se revelam intemporais.Detido injustamente por um polícia branco que já o havia marcado numa altercação anterior, Fonny é acusado de ter violado uma rapariga e é, por isso, colocado na prisão. É a sua namorada, Tish – que espera um filho seu -, quem narra toda a obra, e por ela acompanhamos o avançar do processo onde, infelizmente, nada os protege da inevitabilidade de terem de ser eles, família, a provar a inocência de Fonny. Acaba por ser, portanto, acima de tudo a vida fora da prisão que acompanhamos, o evoluir da situação de Tish e da sua família, e não tanto o de Fonny. Como prosseguir a vida quando um de nós foi injustamente levado, principalmente quando se afigura clara a possibilidade de ter um filho a crescer sem pai num mundo onde pode crescer para que lhe aconteça o mesmo que impediu o seu pai de estar presente? É a resposta da família de Tish, e não da de Fonny, que alimenta a esperança de um futuro diferente, um futuro no qual Fonny saia rapidamente da prisão para uma possibilidade de perseguir os seus sonhos: construir uma família com Tish e ser escultor. No fundo, pouco mais do que ter uma vida normal com a mulher que ama. Mas como pode ser tão ingénua a persecução de algo que para tantos seria apenas simples.Vamos acompanhando, ao longo da obra, os momentos fundadores da relação de ambos; a forma como se conheceram enquanto crianças, como foram sendo os melhores amigos ao longo de todo esse período, como se aperceberam que, afinal, se amavam um ao outro, os seus sonhos de arranjar um lar juntos numa zona onde não sentissem, como no Harlem, o peso de toda essa opressão. No fundo, um casal à procura de se livrar dos seus constrangimentos para que possa, finalmente, viver a sua vida, para os dois e para cada um. Para que seja possível, finalmente, verem-se livres da condição castradora de terem nascido negros numa América profundamente racista, onde as próprias instituições do Estado impossibilitam a criação de um futuro diferente daquele que é, à partida, atribuído a quem, como Tish e Fonny, nasça naquelas circunstâncias. Não interessa se são o contrário da ideia que deles é passada à restante população, esse carimbo fica e tem consequências que se prolongam por todo o lado.Contra esse estigma, essa injustiça, Baldwin não pode deixar de se insurgir. Fez disso a sua luta, para que alguém como ele pudesse não ter de enfrentar aquilo a que ele se viu obrigado. Precisamente por esse elevado pendor social na sua obra (na qual os ensaios de ""Notes of a Native Son"" tomam um peso preponderante), pelo claro tomar parte na luta dos direitos civis, Baldwin acaba fundamentalmente visto como um escritor negro; mais um representante da comunidade que um escritor de pleno direito. O próprio Baldwin debatia-se com esse rótulo. Não o renunciava, via em si esse inegável papel, mas estava longe de se cingir a isso, porque essa é uma visão demasiado simplista para uma obra capaz de explorar tantos pontos.Em livros como ""Giovanni’s Room"", por exemplo, sobre um rapaz branco que se vê a braços com a sua homossexualidade na Paris dos anos 50 para onde emigrou, Baldwin põe precisamente de parte toda a questão racial, afirmando que não era capaz de se focar nos dois problemas, o da sexualidade e o da raça, ao mesmo tempo. A braços com tantos problemas, melhor que focasse a atenção num de cada vez. Porque, no fundo, a obra de Baldwin é a forma que arranjou para expulsar os seus demónios, para entender quem era: negro, homossexual, tudo isso e muito mais. Nessa exploração de condições minoritárias, busca, acima de tudo, a sua própria identidade. Para que sejam outros a dizer-lhe quem é, já basta o preconceito.",pt

It’s a narrative that seems to echew traditional plot and structure, knowing that experience is so light and dangerous and impossible to pin down. Baldwin writes in a way whose closest companion is jazz music, there are flights of feeling that use words as stepping stones to get you across an emotion. One of Baldwin’s great strengths is to be able to write in a manner that never attempts to simplify its subject matter or try to sum up the world in quick moral messages. The other strength, my god, is his ability to capture the nuances of black American life. In this novel we are in New York in the sixties, and the sounds and clothes and laughter and dignity and grocery stores and subway stations all thrum on the page. Baldwin always presents us with the most ordinary circumstances, and their very ordinariness makes you want to put the book down and weep. Because ordinary life is a great noble thing. This book in particular deals with the question of Hope in black communities. It is the story of an 18 year old black woman who finds out she is pregnant after her husband is been incarcerated. How do you have it when your path is being blocked and your rights being taken away? A masterpiece. ",en

But Tish and Fonny have known each other since they were children, about 9 years old, so their love is deep and comprised of so many many things. As if their lives were destined to be together. While Tish and Fonny are the primary characters, the others play such a vital and huge role. There's Tish's parents and sister; Fonny's dad; and Fonny's friend, Daniel, who I understand plays a remarkable role in the movie - which I plan to see. Once I got going with this book, I didn't want to stop. I became entwined in it, and lived it right along with Tish.

135,38463,2639662294,,"DNF at 55%I feel like my Black card is going to revoked because I freaking hated this book so much. With the movie coming out, I was so excited to finally read it because the movie looked gorgeous. While it still does look like the cinematography is amazing, this story makes me not even want to see it.This story follows, Tish and Fonny, as Tish tries to get Fonny out of prison for a crime that he didn't commit. Despite the fact that it sounds like a lot of other black stories, I was still excited to watch the movie. But here's the biggest problem with this story. The story is told from the perspective of Tish but the story isn't about her. It's basically a story about Fonny and the struggles of being a black man, which is fine and dandy. But when Baldwin decided to tell Fonny's story through the eyes of his fiance, he didn't make Tish a character. He literally has Tish's life revolve around Fonny and there's almost nothing in this book that makes her a person. What does she like? I don't know but she knows Fonny likes art. Who are her friends? She had a friend when she was younger but when Fonny came around, her and the other girl didn't speak anymore. There wasn't a mention of any other friends that I can remember. Not only the fact that Tish was the stereotypical good girl with no depth to her made me hate this book. I hated this book partly because it was marketed as a Black love story. I don't even want to get into depth about why that is problematic, but I will say that Black love should not be shown as struggle love and leave it at that. I tried to keep in mind that this was written so long ago, but it didn't help my enjoyment at all. The women in this book were portrayed terribly, exhibiting girl on girl hate all of the time and then not being developed enough. I honestly feel as though this book was written for hoteps, just because it does seem to focus on the problems of being a black man in America. Like I said before, though, it's fine to have stories like that because it's an important conversation. However, I wish it wasn't at the expense of Black women like it is with everything else.",en

You can listen to it on any podcast platform, or you can find it at www.thebookstorepodcast.com! Unsurprised that I liked yet another James Baldwin book.If Beale Street Could Talk feels like an incredibly special novel. When Fonny is imprisoned after a false arrest, Tish and her family take it upon themselves to do whatever they can to get him released. Unconditional love in the face of such adversity is difficult to pull off in a convincing way for me. Where many authors might fall into trite narratives, Baldwin manages to balance the love this family shares with one another and their immense pain. You get the idea that love will not fix everything, but it's what is worth trying to fix everything for. In that way it was very powerful.My one criticism of the novel is that the crime Fonny is imprisoned for is a rape. The book definitely makes it clear that the woman making the accusation was a victim of rape (good), but that she cannot identify her rapist (a little tricky here). In 2018 I think this topic requires a little bit of examination. Clearly this book is a product of it's time (and there are even bigger complicated racial factors to take into consideration), but it's always important to bear in mind where our cultural ideas about rape and rape accusations come from.For an interesting assignment, contrast If Beale Street Could Talk with a great novel from 2018, An American Marriage by Tayari Jones. Both make for great reads with similar themes, and they were written nearly 45 years apart from one another.",en

His writing does all the talking in this novel and it's a true pleasure to experience.If Beale Street Could Talk tells the story of 22-year-old Fonny; a 22-year-old who has been wrongly accused of rape and is in jail awaiting trial. We are told the story through the narration of his girlfriend, 19-year-old Tish.It's a novel that explores the two main characters' intimate romantic relationship and love. It also deals with that love that exists within families. He delves into the complexities of the relationships with those we love and those to whom we are related. He constructs a touching and vivid account of the close bonds that can form with those who we ""adopt"" into our family, showing that it is not just blood that ties us together.It is a novel that deals with the racism that has put Fonny where he is. The only black man in a police line-up, he was set up to be accused by the traumatised woman who had been raped. Tish's alibi counts for nothing. His friend who can confirm the alibi has been taken into custody, and is likely to be abused until he changes his testimony. It explores the institutions that have dictated the places in society where all these different people have ended up.There is no real plot structure. We are thrown into the tale of a group of people who have had a tragedy thrust upon them. We follow their lives for a while and then we leave. There is no clear cut ""beginning, middle, and end"", as there isn't in our own lives. But Baldwin's prose transports me into these characters' lives and envelops my whole mind and soul.

140,38463,1750569862,liked it,"Fragwürdiger Kult des KlauensSchweren Herzens drei Sterne für dieses Zeitdokument. James Baldwin ist sicherlich ein besserer Autor als etliche seiner Generationsgenossen, z.B. William Styron oder Alex Haley. Davon legt dieses Gelegenheitswerk deutlich Zeugnis ab. Wenn sich Baldwin etwas mehr Mühe mit dem Schluss gegeben hätte, würde ich von dieser Bezeichnung vielleicht absehen, aber die letzte Seite ist ein derartiger Abbruch und wirkt so dahingehudelt, als wäre ihm das Schreibmaschinenpapier ausgegangen. Auch sonst geht Baldwin mit der Erzählperspektive ziemlich nachlässig um, sobald der Doppelerzählstrang Liebesgeschichte/Abend nach dem Knastbesuch, der die erste Hälfte ausmacht, durch ist. (view spoiler)[Ein Pamphlet in Romanform bleibt das Buch trotzdem, auch wenn uns der Autor die Verurteilung eines Unschuldigen erspart. Viele GR-Rezensenten hätten sich ja einen klaren Freispruch oder ungerechte Verurteilung eines wegen seiner Hautfarbe in die Mühlen der Justiz geratenen gewünscht, damit der Rassismus eine richtig fette Rote Karte kriegt. Die Art und Weise in der ein weißer Polizist sich für eine nicht durchführbare Verhaftung Fonnys rächt, indem er dem noch mal davon Gekommenen die Vergewaltigung einer geistesgestörten Frau anhängt, ist tatsächlich skandalös. Noch ärgerlicher aber finde ich den Umstand, dass Baldwin für den Fonny auf Bewährung nur eine Zeile und einen drei mal so langen Babyschrei übrig hat und auch keine angemessene Trauerzeit für dessen Vater lässt, der sich kurz vor der Entlassung seines Sohnes vor lauter Verzweiflung das Leben nimmt, weil er beim herbei schaffen seines Anteils an der Kaution erwischt und entlassen wurde. (hide spoiler)]Wenn man, wie ich, kurz zuvor Roots gelesen hat, fällt einem natürlich auch die politische Agenda auf, die hinter beiden Büchern steckt, es wirkt fast so, als hätte der Geist von Malcolm X beiden Autoren gewisse politische Leitlinien vorgegeben, von denen sich Haley im Verlauf seines Buches frei schreibt. Vor allem Kunta Kinte ist der Repräsentant der Malcolm-X-Agenda. Die Verwunderung des aus seiner Heimat geklauten Muslims über den O-Gott-Glauben seiner Frau ist bei Baldwin einer knallharten und ziemlich amüsanten Kampflinie geraten: Die schwarzen Christen sind eitle, egomanische Heuchler, die überall gut dastehen wollen und dafür sogar ihre eigenen Kinder an die Weißen verpfeifen, so wie die Mutter und die beiden Schwestern des zu Unrecht wegen Vergewaltigung angeklagten Fonny. Hauptheldin Tish und ihre Family beschimpfen Schwiegermutti und Schwägerinnen als zu gelb und die ganze Sippe beklaut ihre Arbeitgeber nach Strich und Faden, weil die Weißen, den Schwarzen ja ohnehin alles geraubt haben. Einen kleinen Triumph genießt Tish, als ihr der Polizist, der für Fonnys Verhaftung verantwortlich ist, ihr sogar anbietet geklaute Ware als Kavalier zu tragen. Allerdings hat sie durch ihre eigene Dusseligkeit den Vorfall provoziert, wegen dem der fiese Bulle Fonny ursprünglich wegen Körperverletzung verhaften wollte, da der verprügelte geile Junkie ein Weißer war.PROST BABY! NOCH EINEN?Als Plädoyer gegen Rassismus und Klassenjustiz und Loblied für den familiären Zusammenhalt unter den Schwarzen von Harlem in den 70ern mag das Buch ja noch hingehen, aber selbst dem simpelsten politisch korrekten Gemüt dieser Tage, dürfte die Schwangerschaftsdiät der Erzählerin auf den Magen schlagen. Als Tish, im dritten Monat schwanger, vom Besuch bei ihrem Bräutigam zurück kommt, gibt ihr Mutter Sharon, einst Sängerin mit guter Stimme aber ohne die übrigen Voraussetzungen für eine Karriere, einen Whisky, mit der Bemerkung, das wird dir gut tun. Im weiteren Verlauf des Abends köpft die vierköpfige Familie eine Flasche alten Konjak, den Sharon seit ihren Sangeszeiten für einen besonderen Anlass ausgespart hat, zur Feier des Babies. Tish bechert natürlich munter mit. Da der 19jährigen werdenden Mutter im weiteren Verlauf kein anderer Alkohol mehr schmeckt, klaut ihre Schwester Sis einer Schauspielerin, bei der sie einen Nebenjob hat, regelmäßig ein paar Flaschen Konjak für die werdende Mutter. Die Väter des Brautpaares schieben indessen Doppelschichten und klauen und verticken ihre Beute vom Arbeitsplatz, Tishs cleverer Papa kommt ungeschoren davon, Fonnys Vater wird beim Versuch seinen Anteil für die Kaution aufzubringen erwischt und damit zum Kollateralschaden einer Klassenjustiz, der es nur um Verurteilungszahlen geht. Deshalb manipuliert die Staatsanwaltschaft auch das Verfahren, verhaftet Entlastungszeugen und fliegt sogar das Vergewaltigungsopfer sogar in eine Favela nach Puerto Rico zurück, als Zweifel an der Glaubwürdigkeit der Frau laut werden, die am Ende auf Nimmerwiedersehen in einem Irrenhaus verschwindet. Ziemlich dick aufgetragen und wenn James Baldwin nicht so gut schreiben könnte, dann wäre dieses Pamphlet vermutlich ein Fall für Ein-Sterne-Liga, auch wenn die Karikatur von Fonnys erweckter Mutter und ihr nachgottesdienstlicher Sex mit dem ungläubigen, aber ziemlich schwanzfrommen Ehemann nicht die einzige Perle in diesem Zeitroman ist.FAZIT: Als literarisches Dokument hat Beale Street Blues, trotz seiner Schwächen im Finale, schon einen gewissen Wert. Auch als Maßstab für den Wertewandel. Seinerzeit war das im Exil zu Papier gebrachte Buch über Rassen- und Klassenjustiz in den USA sicher absolut PC und hat die Leser zu Tränen gerührt.Aus heutiger Sicht ist Baldwins Musterfamilie ein versoffener, diebischer Haufen, der wunderwas wie stolz darauf ist, nicht an der Nadel zu hängen. Aber vor der veganen Musterfamilie, die uns ein heutiger, von seinem politisch korrekten Gewissen getriebener Autor als Opfer von Polizeiwillkür vorsetzen würde, graut mir sogar noch mehr. Bei allem, seinerzeit angesagten, Kult des Klauens, den der Autor aus seiner sicheren Villa in Südfrankreich hochjubelt, wird in seinem rührenden Portrait familiärer Solidarität immerhin deutlich, warum es auch die nächste Generation nicht so schrecklich viel weiter bringen wird, Tishs Baby hat gegenüber vielen Altersgenossen schon einen, wenn auch unfreiwilligen erworbenen Riesenvorsprung in Sachen Alkoholkonsum. Deshalb lässt sich der letzte Absatz nicht nur als Totenklage interpretieren: Fonny arbeitet am Holz, am Stein, Er pfeift und lächelt. Und von weit her, aber immer näher kommend, schreit das Baby und schreit und schreit und schreit und schreit und schreit - schreit als wollte es die Toten wecken.",de

144,38463,2479655350,,"Nineteen year old Tish and Twenty-two year old Fonny are about to have a baby. She tells him so during the six o’clock visit: she sitting on one side of the glass partition and he holding the phone on the other. He is excited about the news. But there is this matter of getting him out of jail.If Beale Street Could Talk is a romance so intimacy and isolation are key to the story. But it's Baldwin, so in lieu of the vast sea or the uninterrupted grassland where a couple (read: white) might envision themselves hiding from the cruelty of the world, there is instead the social isolation of being Black in an anti-Black society. Tish and Fonny are working together against it, trying best to cultivate a shield against the structures that invade every aspect of Black life. When Fonny tells Tish's dad he wants to marry her, the older man approves with cautious wisdom: “‘Take care of each other,’ he said, ‘you going to find out that it’s more than a notion.'” Love is certainly more than the performance of romantic gestures between two people; but within this context, this invocation of care reminds me of Saidiya Hartman’s assurance: “care is the antidote to violence.”(8:29)And while situating a love story in a political context always adds a kind of weight, I think Baldwin's style does a lot of heavy lifting to keep this from being overly sentimental. If you read “Sonny's Blues,” then you know “the very cup of trembling” is a place that Baldwin will take you. It's that ecstatic experience that Baldwin captures out of the most everyday moments, pulling readers completely into the emotional landscape of his characters. (For this reason, I’m so excited-nervous for Barry Jenkins’ film adaptation).There is so much to be said about male-female relationships here. To keep it short, they are pretty raw. I'd love to discuss this with a feminist reading group.This is a wonderful review from Yossie Paul: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...",en
145,38463,136736003,it was ok,"I’m a huge fan of James Baldwin; by far the novels I have read of his (Giovanni’s Room, Go Tell it On the Mountain, and Just Above My Head), gave a glorious reading experience that had left a profound effect on me. If Beale Street Could Talk, to my surprise, didn’t have that emotional pull, that instant connection and relationship with the characters, and the superior writing that I would expect from a Baldwin novel. Without a doubt Baldwin’s writing is still great here, but it is not his best. It somewhat has a tone and feel of a cheesy melodrama or sitcom from the 70’s, the characters are real and relatable enough, but the story itself was lackluster. I wanted to feel for the characters and care about their plight, but I couldn’t. I thought Baldwin was perhaps trying too hard to make this story emotional and profound, but instead gave us a somewhat self-serving, undercooked, predictable tale of two teenage lovers where all the odds are against them and we are somewhat forced to feel sorry for them, especially since a unborn child is involved and the daddy is in jail. The entire plot just screams “I want to be a sitcom/tv melodrama/soap opera.” What this novel does deliver is the emotional honesty in what it has to say about American society in the 1970’s, but unfortunately the not-so-great writing style, the lack of real depth in its characters, and the overall cheesy 1970’s soap opera feel left me not enjoying this novel as well as I thought I should have or could have.

But Baldwin's ideas about gender really annoyed me, and Tish turns into an omniscient narrator who can be present in Fonny's mind as he masturbates in prison or can follow Tish's mother Sharon to Puerto Rico to try to convince a witness to change her testimony.

160,38463,2583367042,it was amazing,"Non è affatto semplice scrivere di “Se la strada potesse parlare”. Si potrebbe dire che è il quinto romanzo scritto da James Baldwin; che è una storia d’amore ambientata negli anni ’70 nel quartiere di Harlem, nella Grande Mela: da queste frasi si potrebbero già avere degli indizi sulla natura dei protagonisti, Tish e Fonny.Si potrebbe pensare che i personaggi siano ragazzi e ragazze nere, che vivono una storia d’amore tormentata con, sullo sfondo più o meno distante, le lotte tra i sostenitori del Black Power e la polizia, ma si avrebbe ragione solo in parte. Perché sì, Tish e Fonny sono afroamericani a New York, ma no, in questo romanzo la lotta per i diritti non è portata avanti da movimenti, bensì da persone singole.Tish e Fonny si conoscono da sempre, ma si sono resi conto di appartenersi solo da poco: cresciuti da famiglie diversissime eppure accumunate da più elementi di quanti non vogliano ammettere, le vicende che affrontano li portano l’uno dall’altra, per non slegarsi più. Il loro amore cresce e matura tra i tavolini del ristorante spagnolo dall’altra parte della città, tra le strade del quartiere, tra i banchi di una chiesa; si svincola a strattoni dalle occhiate torve della polizia e dei proprietari delle stanze in affitto, finchè non subisce un duro colpo quando Fonny è arrestato per uno stupro di cui non è colpevole e Tish si rende conto di aspettare un bambino.È proprio a questo punto che conosciamo Tish: la sua voce ci guida attraverso ricordi dei mesi insieme e poi ci descrive, con il suo stile crudo e senza ghirigori (ma non per questo privo di commoventi riflessioni) la speranza, la paura, la voglia di combattere per i propri diritti e contro le sopraffazioni. I protagonisti, però, non sono lasciati a loro stessi, a mo’ di “It’s just Us Against the World”: la famiglia di Tish, infatti, saprà darle un supporto tale, in un momento tanto delicato, che l’amore che li unisce sarà palpabile e sgorgherà dalle pagine di Baldwin. La tenacia di Ernestine, la consapevolezza della madre Sharon e l’affetto del padre Joseph formano la rete di sicurezza che riesce a sostenere il cammino di Tish, a piedi nudi su un nastro sospeso. “Se la strada potesse parlare” è un romanzo toccante ed estremamente realistico, capace di suscitare riflessioni e considerazioni che, forse, in autonomia, non avremmo partorito.

Not as poetic as some of his other works, this book clearly prefigures more modern works such as An American Marriage, which attempt to relate the ways in which white supremacy finds its way into even the most private and intimate of settings. Baldwin's skill is clearly on display when he renders the warm scenes between Clementine's family, or between Clementine and Fonny at the prison.

I know James Baldwin has the talent, but this book I couldn't even FINISH it seemed so stereotypically 70's and what passed for enlightened Afrocentric consciousness at the time though to me now it just read as trite.This book reads like a Soap Opera or after school special or some hokey TV sitcom like ""Mama's Place"". I just started to get bored by (self-described) ""uppity"" African American women getting in everyone's face and TELLING IT LIKE IT IS!

Make a crtique and then LIVE in opposition - it's called SITUATIONISM but I'm not sure of Baldwin was acquainted with it though I do not doubt his great intellect.Some good things to say. James Baldwin creates very believable WOMEN characters. He often writes from the female POV and well I think.

A spiritual yet traditional love. This story is so normal and quintessentially American. It details how a community—a village—deals with the unjust incarceration of one of their own. And, specifically, how it informs and shapes the love of our main characters, Fonny and Tish.And there is love. An all-consuming love that is immense and prodigious. What I find so profoundly beautiful about this book is how Baldwin makes us believe in Fonny and Tish’s love. How it is transcendent and huge and beautiful and tragic. How it saves and damns. How their love is truly a resistant rebellion in a world that so easily casts them aside and attempts to shove them into predetermined boxes. The book also details how tentative and fragile life is as a black American. How one’s world can be drastically altered and damned by the whims of a capricious and systemically racist judicial and criminal justice system. It’s so sad that the story is so familiar.

170,38463,2718602350,really liked it,"Boeken en films vergelijken is altijd een beetje onkies. Het zijn appels en peren. Toch is de verleiding groot. De verfilming van Barry Jenkins gooit hoge ogen, dus kon ik het niet laten om ook het boek van James Baldwin te lezen.Een bijkomende reden is dat ik deze zomer zelf nog eens in Beale Street was. Deze straat in het hartje van Memphis speelde een enorme rol in de geschiedenis van de zwarten in Amerika en is momenteel een van de grootste trekpleisters voor wie het Amerikaanse Diepe Zuiden bezoekt. Vreemd is dat Baldwin in het citaat waarmee de film begint (dat overigens niet in het boek voorkomt) Beale Street in New Orleans situeert. Bovendien speelt zowel de film als het boek zich in New York af. Maar laten we de al dan niet bedoelde geografische verwarring achter ons laten en veronderstellen dat het metaforisch bedoeld is.James Baldwin is zo’n schrijver die hier voortdurend rondzweeft, maar waar ik nooit veel van gelezen heb. Daar komt verandering in, want If Beale Street Could Talk smaakt naar meer. Het is een vrij dun boekje dat bovendien erg vlot wegleest, maar wel blijft nazinderen.De helft van het boek las ik voor de film, de rest de ochtend erna. Dat was niet zo’n goed idee. Omdat het boek en de film zo nauw bij mekaar aansluiten, is het beter om er wat tijd tussen te laten. De (sublieme) filmdialogen zijn zo goed als allemaal letterlijk het boek overgenomen. Dat pleit voor Baldwin, maar je leeservaring wordt er wel erg voorspelbaar door.Het opvallendste verschil tussen boek en film zit hem in de toon. De film is veel melancholischer, zachter, het boek is rauwer, soms ook explicieter. Muziek speelt zowel in de film als in het boek een grote rol, maar in de roman hoor je Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding en B.B. King, terwijl de soundtrack van de film vooral nostalgische jazz bevat. Verder is door de filmmaker uiteraard geschrapt in de voorgeschiedenis en de afhandeling van het centrale verhaal.Maar laten we stoppen over appels en peren. Het gevaar bestaat dat door te veel te vergelijken beide net iets minder gaan smaken. James Baldwin schreef If Beale Street Could Talk in Saint Paul de Vence, een mondain bergdorp ten noorden van Nice, waar ook Marc Chagall woonde (en later ook Bill Wyman, Tina Turner en Roger Moore een optrekje hadden). Hij voltooide het boek op Columbus Day van 1973. Het is een afrekening met zijn vaderland, waaruit hij wegvluchtte. “Whoever discovered America deserved to be dragged home, in chains, to die”. (p.162) Je voelt dat Baldwin over liefde wil schrijven, maar dat zijn woede over onrecht in de weg zit. Als aanklacht tegen onrecht heeft If Beale Street Could Talk helaas nog niets aan zijn bestaansrecht ingeboet, als pleidooi voor liefde ook niet. Dus laat dat het laatste woord zijn: liefde.",nl

And I was surprised that the movie based on this novel is already in theaters so I decided to read the novel and man, I wasn't disappointed! James Baldwin is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite authors and persons. he is so brilliant and the things he has to say are important I wish everybody could read him.This book was written in the fifties about the struggle the black community suffers in America and the racial profiling that destroyed so many young men. We follow a young couple Tish and Fonny who's accused of raping a Puerto Rican woman, and you know right away that he was falsely accused and he is innocent.apart of Tish having her boyfriend in jail, she is also pregnant, she is struggling to get him out and under constant stress. This is a tale about something really rare to found in contemporary novels; Family!Family and Love, and how crucial it is to have a supporting family, people who will have your back otherwise you'll probably parish. It's about the sacrifice your family and loved ones willing to make for you whenever you need or want it, this is so beautiful and I cannot wait for the movie! I read somewhere that the director said ""it's the first time white people had to stare in black people humanity and love"" and I LOVE it. and one other thing while we are in the subject of family, they are not just the people related to you by blood, they might be friends or neighbors.This book is gonna give you a glimpse into the corrupt, broken system that America has since forever till this day! I love writers who can write from the perspective of a girl, and Baldwin write this complex story and really difficult timeline and give the narrative to a 19 years old young woman is just impressive and brilliant! If Beale Street could talk and tell you to shut up and just listen to the black community if Beale Street could talk it would tell you that if a white police officer says something it doesn't mean it's true! if Beale Street could talk it would tell you there's hope, and love, if Beale Street could talk it would tell you black people are human! This novel felt important and urgent everyone should read it! ""I know I can't help you very much right now – God knows what I wouldn't give if I could. But I know about suffering; if that helps. I know that it ends. I ain't going to tell you no lies, like it always ends for the better. Sometimes it ends for the worse.

And if you'renobody's nigger, you're a bad nigger: and that's what the cops decided whenFonny moved downtown."" Fonny has been wrongly accused and unjustly incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit. His soulmate and girlfriend Tish finds out that she is pregnant with their child shortly after. Through Tish, we learn how they fell in love, what led to Fonny's mistreatment and about both families efforts to get him out of prison. IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK is a story about love against all odds but also about social and criminal injustice while being Black in America. This is a story that rings no less true today than it did 45 years ago when it was first published.I thought that the choice of constant perspective of Tish, even when she wasn't with other characters for certain situations, was an interesting stylistic aspect and worked really well in feeling connected to her and others through her. James Baldwin is such a talented and skilled writer and can convey all the emotions and history of a character by describing his or her facial expression or posture in detail for half a page and it is glorious.

It was 4 stars for me until the ending. I do still think this is an important book and don't want to discourage anyone from reading it. Other's may not have a problem with the ending. It is good at showing the ripple effect of what happens when an innocent man has his life and the life of others upended by a false rape accusation. Here, the hope and promise of young love between Fonny and Tish helps them through the ordeal of Fonny's incarceration. Tish is an exceptionally well-drawn character. I loved every bit of her narration. When she wasn't narrating is where the book broke down for me.If Beale Street Could Talk is about more than just a false rape accusation, it's about the systemic problems that allow something like this to happen even when there isn't an attention seeking or malicious accuser. In this case, a rogue racist cop has it in for Fonny and rigs his line-up. Hopefully, there are some protections against that today. If not, that should be relatively easy to correct with some laws in regard to using lineups. In this case, the woman was actually raped, but because she was given a line up with only one black man, and knew it was a black man who raped her, she picks Fonny. I'm still looking forward to the film and have hopes that it corrects some of the things I didn't like. Especially when it comes to the ending. If it weren't for the ending, I'd have given this 4 stars. I loved the film Moonlight and am glad this is in the hands of the same director.",en

189,38463,2672699757,really liked it,"IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK by James Baldwin takes place in 1970’s Harlem, and centers around a young couple: Tish and Fonny. The book starts out during a prison visit where Tish reveals to Fonny that she is carrying his child. From there, the story focuses on their Tish and her family’s efforts to clear Fonny’s name and get him out of jail before their child arrives.This was my first Baldwin novel, and it definitely won’t be my last! I loved how the writing was conversational in some parts, while also being dreamy and philosophical in others. I also loved how supportive Tish’s family was, and thought that Tish and her sister were written so well (their quick wit and clap backs are enough of a reason to read this book). This book, like many of Baldwin’s novels, also highlights racial discrimination in various ways from Fonny’s unjust prison sentence to Fonny and Tish’s search for an apartment. There are also some haunting passages from Fonny’s friend Daniel that really opened my eyes to how a prison sentence can physically and emotionally scar someone for the rest of their lives.While I was questioning why one aspect of the storyline was in the book, I felt like everything else was very cohesive and well structured. And that ending!! I was SHOCKED it ended so quickly. This book I would be perfect for readers wanting to read a classic that is still very applicable to our society today, or readers interested in reading an amazing African American author who has stood the test of time!",en
190,38463,2536398995,liked it,"This is a difficult book to rate & review, to be honest. I think rating-wise i'm gonna go with a 3/3.5, though.I've heard a lot about James Baldwin, his books, the stories he tends to focus on, and his influence as both a black author and an LGBT+ author. I've been really looking forward to reading this particular story, so once I actually got stuck into it I found myself both gripped and eager for more in some places, and a little underwhelmed and disappointed in others.I think a lot of that probably has to do with my own abysmal track record as far as classics go on the whole. I never seem to flounder as far as plot and writing style goes, but usually - which, in fairness, is to be expected - I find myself getting frustrated and turned off by so much of the bigotry that is inevitably prevalent in older writing. Admittedly, Baldwin himself was a fairly open minded and forward thinking guy, especially for the time. He wrote ""The Fire Next Time"", a book that consisted of two essays that focused on race in American history, as well as dealing with race and religion and his own experiences. In all of his books, Baldwin never strayed away from heavy topics and themes that are still relevant even today, varying between race, sexuality, gender, religion, and so on. There is absolutely no denying Baldwin's influence as a writer and a civil rights activist, which is certainly a lot of the reason I had such a difficult time giving this a low rating/even trying to comprehend all the scattered thoughts I had on this book.I think, especially in the current state of affairs, it's certainly a controversial story and choice in topic. In light of the upcoming movie, I've seen a huge spark of interest in this particular book of Baldwin's, with lots of people criticising it for playing on the ""innocent man is accused of rape"" trope, which we all know is very tired indeed. And while in most scenarios I would be inclined to agree, I do think that there was something different in Baldwin's approach. This isn't a story about a woman who falsely cried rape in an attempt to discredit an innocent man. This is the story of a girl who was raped, and was immediately manipulated by white, American police officers. A woman who never saw her attacker, and only caught glimpses of his black skin. She is a woman who was forced to stare at a line-up of five men and point out her attacker, who she could only recognise by the colour of his skin and nothing more, and was presented with a line-up that contained only one black man of the five men. There was never any doubt, not even from Fonny - the accused - or his family/loved ones, that the young woman was raped, they never discredited that fact. Instead, this is a story of a white, American police officer falsely accusing a young, black man of a crime he never committed, and manipulating the system in his own favour. And for that reason alone, I think it's a story worth telling, and a story worth reading.There were so many aspects that I didn't enjoy, be it the language or even the behaviour of some of the characters that we were supposed to adore. I think, had it been a longer book, I'd probably find myself more satisfied if I were able to delve further into the minds of some of the characters I had a harder time figuring out, certainly. And, in the end, this isn't a book about happy endings. It's got an ambiguous ending, and it's a chore sitting down and reading all about their struggles and everything that Fonny, Tish, and their families are facing. On a personal level, I found Frank absolutely abhorrent, which was my biggest personal conflict with the story. I couldn't warm to him, even though I felt like I was supposed to. But the connection and chemistry shared between Tish and Fonny, their love an their playfulness and their compassion, was entirely enthralling. And I found absolutely all of Tish's family - as well as their immediate instinct to accept Fonny as their own and go to such lengths for him - one of the most compelling and endearing aspects of the story. They were all one great, incredible family unit, and I'm certainly glad I read this book no matter how conflicted it left me!",en
191,38463,2556360985,it was amazing,"A really intense story about the persistence of love against the backdrop of racism and apathy. We could expect no less from James Baldwin. I was inspired to read If Beale Street Could Talk because of the hype surrounding the screening of the film at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. I loved Moonlight and seen it a million times, so I'm sure Berry Jenkins' adaptation (Moonlight Director) would be insanely lit and visually gripping. I'm one of those nerds who has to read the book before I see the movie so I can see what the author was talking about and then what the director did. I haven't seen the film yet, but I can't wait to see what the combination of Baldwin + Jenkins will produce. The thing about James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Lorraine Hansberry, Ann Petry is they write ""fiction"" but it ain't really fiction because the stories are all highly relatable to every day life and the struggle of black men and women everywhere. ** alert: slight spoilers ** That being said, we know there are countless people who have found themselves in the shoes of If Beale Street Could Talk characters Fonny, Tish and Tish's mother, Ms. Rivers. We have seen people lost to the prison system for reasons beyond their control — whether it be overly aggressive and racist policing practices, mistaken identity, etc. etc. etc. What took my breath away here is just how much pain you can feel coming from the character of Tish. Tish is just this young girl who's yeah a little naïve, but loves someone (Fonny) so purely, so wholeheartedly that's it's glorious. You can feel the sunlight between them and the romance there is just so deep, painful and real. Set against the situation they find themselves in, you can feel the Bonnie & Clyde vibes. It just shows you like there's nothing any of these fucked up situations can do to stop her from being there for her partner. Her mom, Ms. Rivers, and the love for her daughter — the hope to see her daughter happy and a young family whole, it really just pierces you. Especially, if you've come from a background where prison/detention has played a role in the love lives of people around you. You can just feel the levels of love and the distances that they're willing to go in a situation that seems unreal but is unfortunately too real for too many black and brown people in North America. The book is a whole look into why women and men spend their life savings, time and energy being present in the lives of the family members they've lost to an unjust system. Especially when they've lost them unjustly. It's also a look into the ruthlessness of society, people who do harm because they've been harmed, corrupt policing, the justice system and the huge and smarmy role they play in keeping things the way they are and what that does to people. You literally have people on the outside, like Tish thinking of other adverse ways that they can compromise themselves to help their loved ones. Ways to make money to feed machines by doing things they definitely do not want to but may have to consider to help their loved ones attempt to rectify injustices committed against them. When reading this book being that it was written so long ago, I seen so many pop cultural references and influences that could have been deduced from this book long ago and made current. Examples that come to mind include the film Requiem for a Dream and An American Marriage, a 2018 novel by Tayari Jones. For me, the most unique character in this novel was Ms. Rivers, Tish's mom. I don't even want to get into the wild ass situations that black moms get themselves into trying to help our young men out. Even children that are not their children! But aren't they? I think that's a great question and great concept that James Baldwin puts forth in this novel: the idea around responsibility to and for the youth, being responsible for the men and women in your community as an/the elder. It makes me think of my own mother, my father's mother and all the women on the front lines of the Black Lives Matter movement who literally risk their lives everyday on the frontline while the men take all the media spots and publicity. They're literally out there working, and doing multiple jobs while simultaneously trying to take care of their communities large and small. I really loved this novel and I can't wait to see what Barry Jenkin's does with the film. I saw the trailer yesterday and Regina King's addition (playing the mom Ms. Rivers) only sparked my excitement even further. There's levels to the emotional depth here and I feel like it's one of those novels where everyone is going to take something different away with them. You should read it (if you haven't already).",en
192,38463,2585745698,really liked it,"The Bookstore Podcast features If Beale Street Could Talk on Episode 35. While you're at it, you should also listen to Episode 16, An American Marriage, because they share a common theme. And are both just really good!I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times. James Baldwin's female characters are fantastic. They feel completely genuine. Tish, in this novel, is dealing with her boyfriend's arrest and subsequent incarceration. He is innocent of any crime, framed by a racist cop. Tish's family are truly the most wholesome and wonderful part of this book. They are a close-knit family, her parents and her sister, and they are determined to help Fonny, Tish's boyfriend, as much as possible. It's really just nice to read about a family who love and support each other, instead of one that is constantly bickering. Although Fonny's family is quite dysfunctional, so if you're more into that, that's here too. As I mentioned above, An American Marriage shares a lot with this novel, and I can't imagine Tayari Jones did not read If Beale Street Could Talk. One thing they share that is not exactly great is that the crime in both is a false accusation of rape. To be blunt, I do not like false accusations of rape being thrown around like they're common. I think it shows a bit of a blind spot on the part of the authors. Why not use murder? Or aggravated assault? To continue to include this trope feels like it's giving credence to the idea that men should be constantly in fear of being accused of rape. While I don't think that's what either author intended, that's the result. Without this, If Beale Street Could Talk would nearly be a perfect novel.",en

This was some of the greatest writing that I've read, ever. Fonny and Tish's story was so loving, heartbreaking, emotional, and consuming. I adored Sharon. Her mothering and nurturing of not only her children, but also of Fonny, was inspiring. I can't pick a favorite, because each character equally pulled at my heart and gave me all the feels...most good, some not. I loved Ernestine and Joseph for their protection of Tish, as well as Fonny. I loved Frank for his earnestness, but do wish he had more backbone to stand up to that nasty Mrs. Hunt.This novel, even though it was written in the 70's, addresses topics which are still quite relevant today. Even though I read this in preparation for the movie, I almost feel like I can skip it now, because Baldwin did such a phenomenal job executing the story, that it played out in my mind as I was reading. I won't skip it, of course. I will watch it and hopefully be just as pleased with it as I was the book. ",en
196,38463,2601360293,it was amazing,"This is a really remarkable piece of writing, so powerful, passionate and lyrical, that it’s going to be hard to do it any kind of justice in a review.The novel is narrated by Tish, a nineteen-year-old black girl who lives with her parents and sister in Harlem in the early 1970s. Tish is deeply in love with Fonny, just a regular young black guy except for the fact that he happens to be in jail, accused of a crime he clearly did not commit. As the story opens, Tish is visiting Fonny in prison to tell him she is having his baby, a development she believes will offer them a glimmer of hope, for Fonny loves Tish just as much as she loves him.You see: I know him. He’s very proud, and he worries a lot, and, when I think about it, I know – he doesn’t – that that’s the biggest reason he’s in jail. He worries too much already, I don’t want him to worry about me. In fact, I didn’t want to say what I had to say. But I knew I had to say it. He had to know.And I thought, too, that when he got over being worried, when he was lying by himself at night, when he was all by himself, in the very deepest part of himself, maybe, when he thought about it, he’d be glad. And that might help him. (p. 12)To read the rest of my review, please click here:https://jacquiwine.wordpress.com/2018...",en

I adored this work by Baldwin but the ending wow. Baldwin raises a discussion of love (in all its extremities), struggle, hardship, race, hate but yet shows us how we are all the same at the very heart of it all.

I'd read excerpts and quotes that were enough for me to tell James Baldwin was a writer I needed to know, but this is the first of his books I've read. I was taken aback almost every few pages by yet another piece of gorgeous text, and paused often to reread a paragraph or page. His descriptions of the characters, particularly their relationships to each other, are just so sweet they would make me smile, and I feel like there needs to be a word for smiling that is comparable to ""aloud,"" because that's the kind of smiles they were. I tried to find some examples to share, but I don't think they would work out of context, anyway. And the cultural commentary, the depiction of black life in America—in the 1970s, so some things have changed, but not enough—is so sharp, so insightful, so painful. I cried a few times, too, as well as smiling, and I was sitting in a Starbucks for the last 90 pages, so that was difficult. I already took home Giovanni's Room last night, and I can't wait to start it now.She felt herself going under; people were going under around her, every day; and Albany isn't exactly God's gift to black folks, either. Of course, I must say that I don't think America is God's gift to anybody—if it is, God's days have got to be numbered. That God these people say they serve—and do serve, in ways that they don't know—has got a very nasty sense of humor. Like you'd beat the shit out of Him, if He was a man. Or: if you were.",en

I’m thankful that Baldwin left the ending open. There’s no need to try to find closure- the reality is that a man was stripped of his innocence forced to grow up rather quickly, in the worst way imaginable. Tish held it down for not only Fonny and their unborn child but also for her family. I’m always skeptical about women having to carry the burdens of others, and I loved that Baldwin so eloquently described this sentiment when he wrote, “It is much harder, and it takes much longer, for a man to grow up, and he could never do it all without women. This is a mystery which can terrify and immobilize a woman, and it is always the key to her deepest distress. She must watch and guide, but he must lead, and he will always appear to be giving far more of his real attention to his comrades than he is giving to her.” Once I got over that I grew to understand that the time period had a lot to do with this way of thinking. I applaud Tish and her family for working tirelessly to free Fonny. In reality, they didn’t have to- he wasn’t their son but they chose to do so because he loved their daughter and they loved her. This is my first Baldwin book and I was blown away.",en

I was not expecting that. Set in the 70's in New York City, two young black people, powerless to a horrible system, painfully aware of their poverty and circumstances, cultivate the most touching relationship. Instead of relying on flowery prose, the simplistic writing sets a scene, with the language- jive, baby, ya dig, the location-Black Harlem, hipster filled NYU, emptied out industrial lower Manhattan, the characters- Italian shop owners, Puerto Rican waiters, white cops out for black kids, and the traps a part of daily life-drugs, poverty, projects, prostitution. And in this we find Fonny, Tish and the Rivers family. Improbable and impossible, they are in love. Artistic, shy, young- but yet so real, grounded by their families, family life and friends who fall victim to inner city life, the author makes us believe that they are not absurd. They are not caricatures. And in an all too real twist of fate, what one thing couldn't destroy, another, much stronger, comes in to finish the job. The un-justice system. ",en

I just got around to reading it, this week.This is a good example of a chapter-less novel. I don't think I have ever read one, before. There are only blank lines to indicate scene breaks and to indicate tense shifts (from the past tense references in childhood to the present tense storyline). I found these transitions almost seamless. And, as an editor, it was interesting to see how this book was edited, back then. As for the story itself, I found it relatable on so many levels. There is a movie version coming out, this year.

203,38463,103211816,liked it,"In this novel Baldwin is caught between the naturalistic bent of most of his fiction and a desire to unequivocally champion certain characters and the qualities they possess, i.e., to write about heroes. He clearly thinks the protagonists, Tish and Fonny, and Tish's family are wonderful human beings -- but he can't quite bring himself to present them as making real progress against their troubles in a well-developed plot structure. The reason? He still has a stake in revealing the immense weight of society's evil and sordidness. A romantic novel depicting characters who fight for their values and win a measure of success would undercut his expose esthetics.Thus, there's an uneasy truce between these two views of life, with neither becoming dominant, and both draining the effectiveness of the other. Baldwin tries very hard however, and, apart from this dissonance, writes very well. If you're interested in Baldwin, his struggle is worth witnessing.",en

This is my second in less than a year and every time I'm struck with how much his voice is the pulsing vein beating under the surface of American life, pointing out the injustices that lie on the surface. This time, it's presented through the lens of a love story facing tragic times and potentially disastrous consequences. He constantly reminds one that the U.S. is an unchanging landscape of terror and constant peril for Black Americans. His works remain as relevant now as they were a half century ago when he first wrote them. I recently read that Baldwin was having ""A Moment"" because of the film adaptation of this novel and the documentary, ""I Am Not Your Negro"" that came out last year. Here's the thing with Baldwin...he doesn't ever have to have ""A Moment.""

Writing without fluff, Baldwin doesn't waste words and very emphatically demonstrates the dark shadow of injustice that hangs over this love that the characters have for each other. Baldwin's portrayal of disenfranchised, working class, African-American characters is moving, heartbreaking, and more importantly, is very very honest.A minor point that I feel worth mentioning is Baldwin's treatment of the fragility of the male ego, as demonstrated in the ""tomato-smashing"" scene after Fonny is prevented from being arrested by Tish's intervention. In a book of so many memorable scenes, that scene particularly stood out.Can't wait to see what Barry Jenkins does with this masterpiece.",en

Baldwin is an unsparing but hopeful critic of America; his heart is broken but it does not despair. He hits on many of the same themes as Richard Wright's Native Son, but Baldwin is far more artful in this rendering. There were some moments, particularly in dialogue, that sounded a little off, almost as though there was too much separation between his life in Harlem as a child and his life in France at the stage of his life when he wrote Beale Street.

It's also a wildly readable narrative with some spot on sex scenes, a pivotal and unexpected trip to Puerto Rico, and a perfect ending.

222,38463,2642094650,really liked it,"A perfect start to my reading challenge in 2019. This year I want to read more novels like this one—subversive but beautiful novels with diverse perspectives. Baldwin is so ahead of his time here (or perhaps, more depressingly, nothing has really changed in the 44 years since he wrote it). While reading Beale Street, I was highlighting lines on every second page, because of their absolute relevance to our modern context. Some of the passages that will stay with me most include: “...in this fucked up time and place, the whole thing becomes ridiculous when you realize that women are supposed to be more imaginative than men. This is an idea dreamed up by men, and it proves exactly the contrary. The truth is that dealing with the reality of men leaves a woman very little time, or need, for imagination. And you can get very fucked up, here, once you take seriously the notion that a man who is not afraid to trust his imagination (which is all that men have ever trusted) is effeminate. It says a lot about this country, because, of course, if all you want to do is make money, the very last thing you need is imagination.”And: “...in this fucked up time and place, many women, perhaps most women, feel, in this warmth and energy, a threat. They think that they feel locked out. The truth is that they sense themselves in the presence, so to speak, of a language which they cannot decipher and therefore cannot manipulate, and, however they make a thing about it, so far from being locked out, are appalled by the apprehension that they are, in fact, forever locked in.”And perhaps most simply, but most effectively: “Neither love nor terror makes one blind: indifference makes one blind.”The contrast between Tish’s view of NYC and that presented by white, middle class protagonists in books about the city is startling at first. It’s jarring and foreign to hear a narrator describe New York as “the ugliest and dirtiest city in the world”, yet it so effectively highlights the white Western privilege that is so deeply ingrained in our cultural products. I absolutely cannot wait to see what Barry Jenkins will do to bring this story to the big screen. ",en

(S. 116) Hier passte einfach alles: Setting, Stimmung, Song.Zwischenzeitlich musste ich mir immer wieder deutlich machen, dass das Buch in den 1970er Jahren spielt und die Zeiten sowie die gesellschaftlichen Rollen andere waren. Vom ""Erzählsound"" hätte die Geschichte auch in der Gegenwart spielen können.Ich mochte sehr den Zusammenhalt und die Liebe, die Tishs Familie verbindet und mit welcher Energie sie Fonny und vor allem Tish unterstützen.Trotzdem lässt mich das Buch etwas ratlos zurück. Es ist im Großen und Ganzen kein schönes Buch und sollte es vermutlich auch nicht sein. Das Gefängnis bringt nicht nur Fonny selbst an seine Grenzen, sondern auch seine und Tishs Familie. Gewalt und Rassismus spielt nicht nur außerhalb der Familie, sondern auch innerhalb Fonnys Familie eine Rolle. ",de

I have literally never read pregnancy decribed in such moving imagery! So this is a love story, and i generally need to be in a certain mood to read a love story. I really wasn't in that sort of mood while reading this book but Bladwin just had a way of painting such a lush picture of the lives of these characters that i didn't mind it too much.What I loved the most i have to say, is that while these characters lived in such a harsh world and under even harsher circumstances, there was such warmth and care and kindness shown between the family (well maybe not the Hunt family). I think this book made me realize how unfortunately rare it is to read or see Black young people, especially Black girls and women get this kind of tender and fierce love and support.

Can't say that I enjoyed it particularly, but I recognize that it was a good book and I did enjoy reading about black characters who were more than just side characters for once. Honestly the reason I didn't like it so much is just that reading about a young black woman with nothing in her life but her boyfriend and her pregnancy and family felt like reading a nightmare to me. I loved Tish, but I read so many stories about brilliant, amazing female characters so going back to this was jarring. Super excited to see this as a movie though. Sharon was my favoritr character and I love Regina King, so I know that part will be amazing at least. Overall, an excellent book, but I just did not want to connect with the plot so that took a lot away for me. And as always, reading African American fiction continues to be slightly traumatizing. Really need to find some fun AA fiction that has nothing to do with racism or slavery or police brutality or the trials and tribulations of being black in America.",en
226,38463,2645631174,it was amazing,"“but, just remember, love brought you here. if you trusted love this far, don’t panic now.”that’s my favorite quote from the book and the film. i can easily hear sharon saying it to tish in the film, trying to ease her weary daughter’s heart. that scene/line shows that even in moments of rage and grief, baldwin still let’s love lead in this deeply poetic work. and reading it was almost like being in water, the way certain parts swelled like a giant wave before settling and gently breaching the shore in other parts. it’s almost orchestral, the way baldwin wrote this. the long, ongoing sentences at times match the frazzled thoughts of tish as she continues to move forward to what is happening to her—what is happening to fonny, to all of them, and black people everywhere. it is easy to simply say this book is solely about the injustice (and its effects) black people face in this country, but if you look a little more closely, it is baldwin’s ode to black love in all its shapes and forms. he shows us that while the outcome may not be what we desire, we can still trust in love—the love of each other, of family and friends—to see us through. that if we give up on love then we will have nothing, and it’s that love that sustains tish and fonny, and the rivers family throughout this story. while i wish the ending would have given more closure like the film, i can see why baldwin did it—it was a small beacon of hope at the end. he was reminding us to keep trusting love all the way.",en

The book really details the essence of New York City living in the 1960s. Baldwin shed light to the struggle of poverty and the police system that together was meant to keep black Americans inferior. This kind of systematic oppression continues till this day and it's baffling that there hasn't been a change yet. Millions of families have been effected by this oppression, and Baldwin's novel just sheds the reality of it all as well as the vision of hope that in time things will get better.",en

And some of those conversations have been about how despite that, Black art continues to thrive and grow and amaze. This book reminds me that times were always tough for Black art and Black love . Reading 'If Beale Street Could Talk' I was awed by Baldwin's talent, of course, and made despondent by how current all the themes in this book STILL are, more than 40 years after it was written. But then I remembered the film based on the book, by a newly-recognized artist in Barry Jenkins who beautifully depicts Black love in his medium, just as beautifully as Baldwin depicted it in his.

249,38463,2552418455,really liked it,"Rezension hier: https://licentpoeticae.wordpress.com/...Clementine „Tish“ Rivers und Alonzo „Fonny“ Hunt sind ein junges, schwarzes Paar wie jedes andere auch. Bis auf einen kleinen Unterschied: Tish muss Fonny derzeit im Gefängnis besuchen. Er wird der Vergewaltigung an einer Puerto Ricanerin beschuldigt und sitzt bis zum Prozess in Untersuchungshaft. Tish erzählt ihm, dass sie schwanger ist und gibt ihm das Versprechen, dass sie ihn bis zur Geburt ihres Kindes aus dem Knast holen werden – denn Tish glaubt nicht nur an Fonnys Unschuld, sie weiß, dass er nichts getan hat und es einzig und allein der Willkür weißer Männer zu verdanken ist, dass er überhaupt eingesperrt wurde. Tish und ihre Familie sagen dieser Willkür den Kampf an, aber der Weg, der dafür vor ihnen liegt, ist sehr lang und steinig und die größte Herausforderung dabei ist, nicht die Hoffnung zu verlieren.Der Klappentext spricht von einer jungen, schwarzen Liebe, die voller Hoffnung beginnt, aber noch bevor sie überhaupt richtig aufkeimt bereits vorbelastet ist durch Herkunft, soziale Schicht und Hautfarbe. Fonny und Tish kennen sich schon gefühlt immer, schon seit Schultagen sind sie eng miteinander befreundet. Als sie älter und langsam erwachsen werden wird aus dieser Freundschaft eine Liebe, die sich aus der Gewissheit gründet, dass sie schon immer zueinander gehört haben. Was auf der einen Seite so natürlich und einfach wirkt, stößt auf der anderen Seite auf eine ganze Menge Schwierigkeiten. Während Tishs Familie Fonny praktisch sofort als ihren Sohn adoptiert, ist sie in seiner Familie eher skeptisch beäugt, zumindest von Fonnys Mutter und seinen Schwestern. Denn Tish hat vergleichsweise dunkle Haut, während Fonnys Mutter und Schwestern heller sind und sich dadurch für etwas Besseres halten – näher an den Weißen dran, sozusagen. Man braucht wohl nicht zu erwähnen, dass die Bemühungen der Familie Rivers ungleich größer sind, als es darum geht Fonny aus dem Knast zu holen, obwohl es nur seine „Schwiegerfamilie“ ist. Zudem war es für die beiden unfassbar schwierig, eine Wohnung zu finden. Niemand wollte an ein schwarzes Pärchen vermieten.Als dann eine Puerto Ricanerin überfallen und vergewaltigt wird und angibt, dass ihr Angreifer ein Afro-Amerikaner war, steht plötzlich die Polizei bei Tish und Fonny vor der Tür und verhaftet ihn. Bei einer Gegenüberstellung identifiziert das Opfer Fonny als den Täter, was die Sache zunächst recht eindeutig macht. Allerdings nur so lange, bis man erfährt wie diese Gegenüberstellung abgelaufen ist. Wenn man einer traumatisierten Frau sechs Männer gegenüber stellt und ihr das Gefühl aufdrängt, dass einer von ihnen es gewesen sein muss, und wenn dann auch noch fünf von diesen Männern weiß sind und nur einer schwarz, sie aber mit Sicherheit weiß, dass ihr Angreifer dunkelhäutig war… Nun, dann hat man eigentlich alle Zutaten für polizeiliche Willkür. Und tatsächlich werden schnell die größten Zweifel an Fonnys Unschuld aus dem weg geräumt, denn der Polizist, der ihn verhaftet hat, hat noch eine Rechnung mit ihm offen.James Baldwin, der als einer der bedeutendsten Schriftsteller des 20. Jahrhunderts galt, hat sich in diesem Buch mit bedauerlicherweise immer noch sehr aktuellen Themen auseinander gesetzt: Alltagsrassismus und Polizeiwillkür. Sprachlich unglaublich intensiv und schön (was in dieser Thematik auch bedeutet manchmal schonungslos hässlich) hat er eine Geschichte erzählt, die ich mir in der heutigen Zeit vorgestellt habe – bis ich feststellte, dass Baldwin Fonnys und Tishs Geschichte bereits 1974 geschrieben und veröffentlicht hat. Es hat mich kurzzeitig wirklich erschreckt, wie zeitlos sie ist.„Beale Street Blues“ ist ein Buch, das sich nicht zwischen Tür und Angel lesen lässt. Man muss sich Zeit dafür nehmen, man muss sich darauf einlassen, man muss Tishs und Fonnys Verzweiflung und Hoffnung spüren. Es ist eine schmerzhafte, aber auch eine wichtige Geschichte, wie die Golden Globe Nominierungen der diesjährigen Verfilmung auch noch einmal unterstreichen. Von mir gibt es absolut verdiente vier Punkte!",de

253,38463,1360194188,it was amazing,"This book is a must-read and so important. It discusses the topics of racism, class and gender politics, police brutality and wrongful accusation in an unflinching, painfully realistic way that is just as - if not more - relevant today as when the book was written in the early 1970s. The protagonist and narrator is a nineteen-year-old black woman named Tish, whose fiance, Fonny, is arrested under suspicion of having raped a woman, despite no real evidence, simply because of the color of his skin. The book alternates between flashbacks to Tish and Fonny's courtship and the events leading up to his arrest and a present timeline that sees Tish, who is now pregnant with Fonny's baby, and her family desperately attempting to get him out of jail. Honestly, it is a situation that could just as easily happen in the present; perhaps advancements in forensic technology make it slightly less likely, but I've also seen news stories that unfold in a terrifyingly similar way.I had so many emotions while reading this book. I got chills in some parts. I felt near to crying in others. Sometimes, I felt like throwing the book across the room in anger or frustration at yet another awful setback. This is largely the work of Tish's characterization and voice, both of which are brilliantly handled. Throughout the book, she grieves, she nurtures, she gets pissed off, she gets things done. I loved how multifaceted Tish's character was, equal parts strong and sensitive. The most impressive aspect is that the moments where she gets angry or vengeful aren't just written as if she were a man in everything but name. She always remains very clearly a female character and is probably one of the most realistic women written by a man I've ever read. Most of the other characters are equally fleshed-out, despite receiving less page time. Tish's family is supportive but also have their own lives and concerns outside of Fonny's incarceration. Fonny himself is hugely sympathetic, even though we only get to know him through dialogue and Tish's inner perceptions. Even the white lawyer who is hired by the family to defend Fonny has multiple dimensions.As far as the prose goes, I read Giovanni's Room about a week before I read this, and Baldwin's style has many aspects in common in both, but I found it so much more affecting and fully-realized here. Although I did sympathize with David in Giovanni's Room, I found Tish so much more passionate and gripping. This could partly be due to the fact that she is a very different character, but I also think it's a clear marker of Baldwin's growth as a writer between these two novels. The prose here is less distant, more volatile and more impactful overall. Baldwin also employs this neat trick of maintaining Tish's first-person narration throughout while also managing to describe events and conversations that occur without her by having her hypothosize about how they would have gone. It sounds like it wouldn't work, but it oddly does.The ending is ambiguous as to Fonny's fate, but in a book as relentlessly bleak as this one, I can't see any other ending working. A definitively happy ending would have likely seemed cheap or unrealistic, while a definitively tragic one would have been too miserable to bear. This way, the reader can come to his or her own conclusion, and since the book is arguably more about a social message than a tidily-resolved plot (after all, there are rarely tidy resolutions in life itself), it makes sense as an authorial choice. At any rate, although circumstances themselves are not resolved, there is a clear emotional resolution in the character growth of both Tish and Fonny.I only have a couple minor complaints. For one, the book does use some language that would be considered offensive from a contemporary perspective. I was especially put off by a certain homophobic slur, but it and other questionable words only showed up occasionally and didn't hinder my overall reaction to the story. They were also probably realistic choices for the time period. Additionally, despite the strong characterization of others, Fonny's family was so demonized that they came across as very flat and caricaturistic, which slightly threw off the book's otherwise impeccable realism and made it hard to feel sympathy for them when they weren't being awful. They, too, did not appear often enough for this to be a major issue. Therefore, the rating is still an enthusiastic (and highly recommended) five stars.",en

256,38463,1964957186,really liked it,"If Beale Street could talk is a glimpse into the lives of two lovers and their working class families. It's impact on the reader is more subtle than Giovanni's Room but still significant. The narration is generally simple and is told from the perspective of 'Tish, a pregnant nineteen year old whose boyfriend since childhood, and father of her child, is locked up for a crime he didn't commit. There's plenty drama in that matter alone to carry such a seemingly simple plot, but the story is truly revealed within and between the two families. The words and acts that pass between them are real and honest. They're not perfect characters, they're human and from what I can tell about James Baldwin so far is that those are the characters he's good at.I suppose on the surface Beale Street has the feel of a ""love conquers all"" or ""they don't have much but they have love"" kind of story, especially with this ridiculously cheesy 1974 edition I read (will try to post it), but this is not that story. After all, it's much easier for love to conquer for those to whom society caters and expedites to its most elevated rung. Supported by the love of her family and Frank, her boyfriend's father, Tish is able to stay above water, but she and her family are out numbered by the systemic racist forces embedded in this world. There are parts of this story that remind me of Ellison's ""Invisible Man,"" the way the characters are so colorful, like David, but just barely detectable in society. As in Ellison's work, the reader witnesses people who are trapped in such a way, damned no matter what they do and at every turn; forced to shuffle in the narrow space between two bold white lines on either sides of the road, and the pale and flaccid cock upon high that's giddily waiting to fuck them over for stepping out of line. This concept is driven home even in getting to know the characters. You know Tish's thoughts and feelings but also feel like she's so far away from you, as though, you the reader may be the one she's carrying in her, you're right there ""under (her) heart,"" but cannot touch her or really SEE her. And you have trouble seeing her because everything in our world is organized to keep us from really seeing each other especially as ""we"" are beyond the veil, as DuBois would say. The characters are not superficial, however, there are many small instances that expand the characters brilliantly. While looking for the woman who accused Tish's boyfriend of rape, Sharon, Tish's mom observes a singer in a night club, ""My gal and I! cries the undernourished rock singer, whipping himself into an electronic orgasm. But no one who had ever had a lover, a mother or father, or a Lord, could sound so despairingly masturbatory."" This line for me really exposed the decades that have passed for Tish's parents, and the trials they had faced that aren't described in the story. This line also sets the tone for the story, how times had changed for many but for them the change was really just on the surface, and how for them the ""progress"" witnessed would more accurately be described as ""despairingly masturbatory.""Though not always consistent in the narrative as there are a couple pockets where you are in 'Tish's thoughts but they're not really consistent with her character, it is still a great story, definitely worth a read.",en

I know that I was christened Clementine, and so it would make sense if people called me Clem, or even, come to think of it, Clementine, since that’s my name: but they don’t. People call me Tish. I guess that makes sense, too. I’m tired, and I’m beginning to think that maybe everything that happens makes sense. Like, if it didn’t make sense, how could it happen? But that’s a really terrible thought. It can only come out of trouble – trouble that doesn’t make sense.” – p 3.If Beale Street Could Talk by James Baldwin is the story of a couple, Tish and Fonny, in 1970s New York City. Tish and Fonny are looking for an apartment to move into together and are planning on getting married when Fonny is falsely accused of raped and is imprisoned awaiting trial. While Tish and her family do all that they can to get Fonny out, Tish also discovers she is pregnant, adding an urgency to the family’s efforts. At its core, Beale Street is both a love story and irrefutably an indictment of the criminal justice system. Overall, I really enjoyed Beale Street, I thought it was beautifully written. I think my largest criticism would be Tish’s lack of character development. I know I initially said this was the story of Tish and Fonny, but it was really Fonny’s story.I was lucky enough to participate in a buddy read for Beale Street with Amaka (@aroundthewaybooks), Claire (@badgalreading), Erica (@e.reads), Necia (@luvnecia), and Reggie (@reggiereads). One thing that struck me from our conversation was how this story of policing and false imprisonment could be told, right now, today.What also struck me from our conversation was how much Baldwin wrote this book FOR Black people, and that really means a lot to me.This Friday, I saw the movie adaptation with Amaka, Necia, and some other lovely ladies (please let me know your handles! I’m so bad at this lol)! I thought it was a good adaptation, and that they did very well by the book.

I'm a big fan of Jenkins, but if I see the movie before I read the book, the filmmaker's visual style and the actors' faces dominate my imagination. I want to have my own internal visual experience before I watch someone else's. Aside from the rare lapse into purple prose, a few dated ideas about gender roles (not sure if these belong to Baldwin or his characters -- if the latter I retract my criticism), and the occasional bit of dialogue that reads too much like a prepared speech, this book is a beauty. Baldwin takes the risk of writing this novel from the first-person perspective of a 19-year-old woman, but his empathy and observational skill make you believe this young woman is telling her life to you, not being dreamed up by a then-49-year-old man. This is the warmest, most optimistic Baldwin work I've read even though some terrible things happen. Many of his characters are isolated and lonely (sometimes by circumstance and sometimes by choice) as they try to survive in a racist world, but the characters at the center of this novel, though dealing with many of the same sorrows and burdens and daily indignities, love, support, and understand each other (with a few sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic exceptions) and help each other carry the load. This is a great love story about couples and families. ",en
262,38463,2539866961,it was amazing,"This is Baldwin. This is black excellence. This is everthing EXCELLENT. Although told from the voice of the young protagonist ""Tish"", one of the most striking things I found about this book is how he ""opens up"" each of the black men in this story, right before you and displays their humanity, right before your eyes so subtle yet so deliberate. There's no monologue declaring their manhood, no dialogue lamenting on their humanity. There is just depictions of each man relating to the conflict, to their wives and daughters, and to each other. It's beautiful and at times haunting to watch on the page and it's beautiful to watch in real life. That because of, not in spite of the world turning against them, they have turned to each other. They had to save their families. They had to save themselves. They had to save each other. They had an intimacy between them that was real and tangible.In this story family is a verb, love is a burden and struggle is real life. Read this book if you believe everything has a happy ending. It will change your mind. Sometimes things just end, not happy, not sad, just so.",en
263,38463,2446154174,it was amazing,"Excellent. I have read three Baldwin books in the last six weeks, inspired by reading I Am Not Your Negro, which draws on interviews with him, quotes from him based on his relationships with U.S black activists, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X amongst them. I find he has a way of describing emotions, and not-having emotions, rich, detailed yet succinct and punching to the point. His observational powers I find are immense. This book, set in 1970's Harlem and Greenwich Village, tells the story of a couple, the narrator being the fiancee and mother to be, and the repercussions from their crossing the path of a racist and misogynist white New York cop and the institutional racism of bureaucrats. The book details the dynamics within and between their families, their responses to the imprisonment of the young male, wrong accused of a serious crime.The novel however is not all despair and anger. It is essentially a tale of the resilience that love and respect between people can bring to those caught up in a world tainted by mindless hate. ",en

There’s something about Baldwin’s writing that is so human, so moving - the kind of writing that makes you put the book down for a minute every few pages and think about what you just read. ??The story is told from the viewpoint of Tish, a young African-American woman fighting to get her fiancé, Fonny, out of jail for a crime he did not commit. The story is searing in its portrayal of injustice and racism, but I was able to find hope in the powerful love that binds the characters together. It is not just romantic love, but the love between family members as well. Tish’s family will stop at nothing to get Fonny his freedom, and despite the tragedy of it all, the unflinching and radical love this family has for each other rings loud and clear - they will not be beaten down. ??""It’s a miracle to realize that somebody loves you.""??It makes me want to throw out my TBR and spend the rest of the year solely reading his work.

I only know Baldwin through his reputation, and after finishing this one I am kicking myself that I’ve left it so long to read one of his books.A love story set in Harlem in the early-1970s; the novel evocatively recreates a certain time, space and community. Exploring the complex interweaving of family, culture, race and justice, it strikes a lovely balance between sweet and sad; anger and forgiveness. Despite the overwhelming injustice of the story, and the anger that this injustice generates, the novel is ultimately an optimistic one. It stresses the importance of the bond between those who suffer from oppression, especially between members of a family; a bond that otherwise would not be experienced if circumstances were brighter. As society disintegrates in a collective sense, smaller human unity will become more and more important. I liked it an awful lot, so if it sounds like your bag, head down to the nearest library.",en
266,38463,22168675,liked it," This is my 2nd James Baldwin novel. I loved Go Tell It On The Mountain. It was no surprise I didn't like this as much, but I still love his style of writing.  The story dealt with Fonny and Tish, 2 young African-Americans in early 70's New York, who are in love, but separated when Fonny is accused of rape. Racism is the underlying and overlying subtext - the white cop who arrested Fonny, how they are treated in NY and the U.S. itself. With all the talk of Rev. Jeremiah Wright and racism in the U.S., it was interesting to read this at this particular time. The argument over how far America has come is still raging.  Maybe I'm really dense, but I still haven't figured out the title. I know and have been on the famous Beale Street in Memphis. Since the novel took place in New York and Puerto Rico, where does Beale Street come in? Does the famous street have a less famous cousin in NYC? ",en

I adored the loving depiction of Tish and her family. The book is sad and tragic, an indictment of a justice system that seems to only have gotten worse since Baldwin wrote this, but it ends on a note that hopeful about the future love can build. I cannot wait for Barry Jenkins to adapt this novel to the big screen, there's no one else who I think could do this book justice. Trigger warning, the book does use slurs about race, sexuality, and gender in a derogatory fashion. Given Baldwin's commitment to social justice, and his own identity as a queer man of color, it's more than clear he did not agree with these sentiments, but for those uncomfortable reading the f*gg*t word and c*nt, just be aware that they're said by multiple characters.",en

I picked this one out because I'd been craving another Baldwin read and then saw a trailer on instagram for the film adaptation (in theaters Nov. 30). This novel was a short, quick read, but not because of a lack of substance--just the opposite. The story is told from the perspective of Tish, a 19- or 20-year-old girl whose fiance has been falsely accused of and jailed for rape. I keep writing and deleting my description of Tish, which speaks to my inability to properly articulate this incredibly complex, bold, moving, brave character.

I could not help to think all along of Angela Davis and her critique of the prison industrial complex while reading the book, not less of many other intellectuals who have openly denounced the structural hurdles that African Americans have to face in a society they have helped to build.

283,38463,2650486468,it was amazing,"...people don't believe much and I'm beginning to know why...Here is a story of suffering. Of enduring. And then suffering some more. If Beale Street Could Talk doesn't simply talk, it sings from the soul, following its star-crossed young lovers from childhood to adulthood, from innocence to despair, and laying bare everything that the journey entails. In Baldwin's eyes, the loss of purity stems not from a sexual awakening (on the contrary, sex is seen as exhilarating, life-giving), but from the realisation that, if you're black, the world is forever going to be out to get you. That if you're black, you're going to grow older faster, older before your time. As if to drive home the point, there's Billie, Marvin, and Aretha on the soundtrack, poetically wondering what the fuck is going on with voices drenched in pain, voices irresistibly moving. Much like the author's own.Trouble means you're alone.Where Baldwin's much-heralded Go Tell It on the Mountain lost credibility was in its final act of salvation before the Lord. There's no such piety here. Beale Street steps into the church early on, sees nothing but a farcical lunatic asylum full of the deranged and the malevolent, and gives God a wide berth from that point forth. Faith cripples, faith corrupts, faith destroys. Consider: Fonny's mother, the maniacal Mrs. Hunt, so in thrall to her hate-spewing Jesus that she first neglects and then rejects her own son and bloodline, compromising his existence so that she can guarantee her own in an afterlife that won't ever come....I don't think America is God's gift to anybody - if it is, God's days have got to be numbered.But if there is no church, then there needs to be a society. And in Beale Street, American society is deaf, dumb, and blind. A nation that disables and metes out death sentences to its black inhabitants before they've even understood what's happened: the kids had been told that they weren't worth shit and everything they saw around them proved it. Self-fulfilling prophecies abound, where even fellow blacks are willing to hang their brothers and sisters out to dry in order to get ahead in a system that, ultimately, won't ever give a damn about them. But it's the silence of white America that's most pernicious of all becauseIn that eye, you do not exist: if you are lucky. If that eye, from its height, has been forced to notice you, if you do exist in the unbelievably frozen winter which lives behind that eye, you are marked, marked, marked, like a man in a black overcoat, crawling, fleeing, across the snow. The eye resents your presence in the landscape, cluttering up the view. Presently, the black overcoat will be still, turning red with blood, and the snow will be red, and the eye resents this, too, blinks once, and causes more snow to fall, covering it all.So is it any wonder that what once began wide-eyed quickly exhausts itself with the rage, the fury, the contempt; the incarceration, the disenfranchisement, the enslavement. Baldwin's America has prejudice in its veins, blood on its streets, and black bodies piling up in its graveyards. Pain is torn out from the self, disgorged in lachrymose bursts in order to find a cure, to survive. Is survival even an option, though? Death marks the finale, one which caustically occurs on a Columbus Day to commemmorate the invaders. Death. Yes, this Harlem love story is one where dreams are savaged in the womb, mutilating those souls that wish only to sing but won't ever have a chance to do so. No one conveys more powerfully than Baldwin what suffering is, what hardship is, what being black is.He is not alone; we are not alone.And it's because Baldwin knows what it is to be black that Beale Street is about so much more than the torment. Because to be black is to be joyful, to be beautiful too. What joy there is in this novel! Baldwin's narrative is alive with the playfulness and vivacity of spirits that refuse the subjugation demanded of them, that carve out safe havens in their homes, in their togetherness, in their gifts of being. Beale Street is bursting with humour, outraged by the wrongdoings done against its characters, but able to poke fun at black America all the same and find a laugh in even the darkest of moments (immortal lines: ""Blessed be the next fruit of thy womb. I hope it turns out to be uterine cancer. And I mean that.""). The familial dynamic at the core here is fully lived-in, the most believable that there perhaps has ever been, bound together with unwavering, palpable affection despite being stretched to breaking point. Think of how Tish, her folks, and her prospective father-in-law, Frank, unite in defence of their beloved Fonny, sacrificing their time and so much more to give him the best possible chance of acquittal. Think also of how threads of kindness are interwoven within this unjust world - the restauranteurs who give free meals, the immigrant landlord who offers a home against all odds, even the white lawyer who for some reason cares - and how vital these threads of kindness are when you're a PoC. This is community. A world of compassion that exists beneath, above, beyond the jaws of this democratic Hell, and it's this which ensures that solitude, no matter what Billie sings, will never be an option.Somewhere, in time, Fonny and I had met: somewhere, in time, we had loved; somewhere, no longer in time, but now, totally, at time's mercy, we loved.What love there is here too. A love that ties and a love that heals and a love that simply by being love offers enough hope to reach tomorrow. Beale Street isn't as formally ingenious as other outright masterpieces in literature, but Baldwin's prose is infused with a streetwise lyricism that can take one's breath away - driven by that hope, that belief in something better, that knowledge that there is better. A hope misguided perhaps, but if there is suffering and injustice and laughter and love then hope needs to be here too, because Beale Street rhapsodically encompasses the entire breadth of the chaotic tapestry that is living, so therefore there's got to be hope. This is a novel that so often leaves one on the verge of tears, tears that exist not because of the cruelty of the external world but because Baldwin realises just how sublime and wonderful life is, if it's simply allowed to be. The heartache that will remain perpetual is, of course, that for a poor black man in 1974 - and a poor black man in 2018 - that privilege, which shouldn't be a privilege at all, is all too often denied. But the magic of If Beale Street Could Talk is that we know - so vividly, so gloriously, so blissfully - that it can be....what can get worse can get better... what can get worse can get better...

306,38463,2705171352,it was amazing,"If I were writing a quick pitch of this (because people have mercilessly short attention spans) I'd write 'tender, desperate, optimistic, beautiful' and leave it there. I'm not, obviously. I've done weird and analytical reviews for months and I'm not about to stop now. But this book is unfamiliarly beautiful — unfamiliar because I don't read many beautiful books, and I'm finding it's rather difficult to analyse something beautiful. The point of beauty is that it speaks for itself. As a reviewer I'm supposed to do the talking for the book, but in this situation I'm reminded of Todorov's words: 'When the critic has said everything in his power about a literary text, he has still said nothing; for the very existence of literature implies that it cannot be replaced by non-literature.'Still, I'll do my best. I think the most wonderful thing about this book is the infusion of spiritual things, love and hope and giving life, into a reality of morning sickness and racism and unjust imprisonment. It balances past and present, humour and pain, hope and despair, love and hate — but always leaning more on the side of hope and love. When things are balanced as precisely as in this book I imagine a nimble-fingered craftsman at work instead of an artist, but there's nothing meticulous about the unabashedly honest emotion in this. Fonny and Tish's love is boundless — We were a part of each other, flesh of each other's flesh — which meant that we so took each other for granted that we never thought of the flesh. He had legs, I had legs — that wasn't all we knew but that was all we used. They brought us up the stairs and down the stairs and, always, to each other. — and real (they get wildly excited because their perfect loft has a roof). Really, it's kind of a miracle that such a precious love was conceived by two people who only noticed each other when the girl raked a rusty nail across the boy's cheek and her friend screamed that he was going to get an infection and die. I of course am using the word conceived to its full meanings here, because quite clearly Fonny and Tish's unborn child is a symbol for love and endurance and possibility. Nowhere near to being a parent myself, as I read this I began to really think for the first time of the miracle that is having a child. For there to be nothing and then — through love — something. It's an immensely powerful idea that transcends all the earthly crap anyone can throw at you. Even though Fonny is in prison for something he didn't do; and Frank and Joseph have to steal to support their families; and Tish hasn't even been able to hold Fonny's hand in six months, there is still the fact that Tish is going to have a baby with Fonny — that they'll bring life into this world by sheer force of loving each other. This book is wonderfully optimistic, because what's all the shit in the world against a power like love?I'm missing out a lot of things: the vivid picture of being black in 1970s New York City, the clarity of every character dynamic, funny dialogue and some of the most romantic scenes I've ever read in my intervention-seeking HR-dependent life. I've reined in the emotion so far, but now I'm going to let it come out in full force as I declare that I think somehow this book knows and understands me. It's my first by James Baldwin and although he and I have nothing in common — he's a gay black American man who grew up religious; I am none of those things — I have the absurd feeling that I'm his ideal reader. I thought every single sentence was sheer perfection, but there's something more than that that I can't quite put my finger on. I feel oddly possessive of this book, as if there's no one else in the world who can or will have the same reaction that I do. You may wonder then what the hell I'm doing writing a review that's to convince other people to read it. No, it isn't a steadfast belief that good things ought to be shared. I really have gone mad in thinking that something in this sings uniquely to my soul. ",en
307,38463,1929134313,it was amazing,"If I were to tell you just the straight plot of this book - that it criss-crosses between the first days and weeks of the relationship between two people, Tish (our narrator) and Fonny (her love) and in what is the present time of him being in jail as he awaits a trial for a rape he didn't commit while Tish discovers she is pregnant and what can be done from there - it might not sound like it would necessarily be one of the all-time major reading experiences of a life. But Baldwin isn't about the story (though he is a damn excellent storyteller and keeps one without any way of knowing how things will turn out for Fonny, though one may expect it to not be for the best) - this is a book that is wholly about *feeling*, what it means to feel the constant sting and barbs and harrowing fear and anger of oppression, but also the feeling of complete and total love that a man can have for a woman and a woman for a man. It is about feeling alive or dead inside, about feeling goodness or hope or despair, all of those things. It is a book that cries put against racial (and in its way sexual) dominance and terror and looks to find some speck of goodness... But, it being Baldwin too (and I knew to expect this having not yet read his fiction but a ton of his non fiction and essays) that it is chock-a-block full of the wisdom of someone who has lived and loved and lost greatly. That he does it from a woman's perspective is also a plus, but overall it is how this thing FLOWS from one line, one word, to the next that is extraordinary. And all of this on top of depicting a different sort of New York than one thinks from listening to Good-Hearted Liberals who think living in such a metropolitan area is a good thing. This... Shows a whole other side to it. Id put it alongside Crime and Punishment as one of those books where I walk away going ""wow. That is the human experience laid out for you!"" How wise? Oh I could post a dozen quotes from here and not come close to signaling just how incredible a brain is behind this, and how observant of the human condition! But here are a few:",en
308,38463,2616291043,really liked it,"This was my first James Baldwin read, yet this has encouraged me to want to read more. I was originally drawn to this novel because it was turned into a movie and because I was told this story has parallels to An American Marriage.This short, yet vividly detailed and intimate novel, explores Black love. The protagonist is a young woman named Trish who is a mother to be and fiance to Fonny. Fonny is unjustly incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit. As Trish and her family fight to get Fonny out, the audience sees the powerful and sacramental love of this Black family. Trish and Fonny have known each other since childhood. Through a series of flashbacks, and a bit of a stream of consciousness narrative telling, you see what drives Trish, who bears the weight of the situation and her growing, fiesty baby, to keep working and visiting her fiance. You also see how their love pushes/nourishes Fonny behind bars.The powerful love this story illuminates also extends to their family. The love Trish's mom, father, and sister show to one another is beautiful and outstanding. Whether they are helping to raise money legally or otherwise, they all help to contribute to paying for the attorney and bond needed for Fonny.Lastly, this novel reminds me of the saying that time served behind bars is ""hard time"" and reaches beyond the walls of the prison. Fonny's incarceration impacts the mental, emotional, financial, and physical health of all the characters.Read this novel to discover first hand my aforementioned thoughts and more. This novel does not end in a fairy tale. But it has an ending that is true and is reflective of the racial climate and mass incarceration background of today.",en
309,38463,2679163858,it was amazing,"It was such a treat to read this moving, beautiful novel by James Baldwin. I'd previously only read The Fire Next Time, by Baldwin, so I didn't know what to expect from his fiction.I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the writing. Baldwin is a master with words, not overly wordy but saying exactly what he means, hitting you where it hurts every time.It helps that this is such a moving story. Tish and Fonny are two young people living in 1970's NYC and deeply in love. Growing up together their whole lives, their romance blossoms slowly and then all at once into a passionate intimacy. They have their whole life ahead of them--they have time. And then Fonny is arrested.Told from Tish's perspective, and in a non-linear format, we begin with the revelation that Tish is pregnant. Flashing back to their childhoods and early romance, we fill in the gaps of Tish and Fonny's love story as Tish and her family struggle against a system of racial injustice and try to free Fonny from prison before the baby is born.Baldwin has a lot to say about injustice, prejudice, black masculinity and white cruelty. But he also shows us a vision of deep love, between lovers, between families and between communities. Despite its heavy topic/material, I feel like this is an ultimately hopeful and uplifting story. Definitely add this to your list if you've never read Baldwin, and I'll look forward to reading more of his books in the future.Listen to a full review of this book and the movie adaptation, directed by Barry Jenkins at covertocredits.comOr check out my podcast, Cover to Credits, wherever you get your sweet sweet podcast content!",en
310,38463,2682683999,it was amazing,"If Beale Street Could Talk is a novel by James Baldwin written in 1974. The story concerns a young black couple in Harlem. Tish is pregnant and her fiancee, Fonny, is in jail for a crime he did not commit. Tish finds herself trying to convince their families to help her with getting Fonnie released as soon as possible. Baldwin writes this couple is a most romantic way that is rarely depicted so sincerely, with such authenticity to strip the characters souls bare in front of you. There are no big twists or tropes we find in a conventional romance. Instead we find characters adjusting and coping with the new circumstances an unjust society has lead them to. In between the story progressing of these characters trying to figure what happens next, Baldwin writes flashbacks about how they first met and when they fell in love. It makes a cynic like me almost fall for the idea of true love. Only because he depicts the setting these characters are in as brutal and unforgiving and guiless as we know our world to be. I'm looking forward to seeing Barry Jenkins (director of Moonlight) adaptation of the book in the theaters soon! But I'm even more excited to read more Baldwin just to feel his words breathe actual life into me. He explored romance, racism, classism, familial love, domestic violence, familial love, and more all in this concise novel. It's a treat to the mind and soul.",en
311,38463,2689552763,really liked it,"Wow! So so so amazing... above everything this really is a novel about love... im thinking about the part where Tish is talking about Sis and Dad and their relationship dynamic.. ""She knows Daddy better than I do. I think it's because the she's felt since we were children that our Daddy maybe loved me more than he loves her. This isn't true and she knows that now - people love different people in different ways - but it must have seemed that way to her when we were little."" A love thats a little less or a little stronger. A love that grows and changes as its subjects do. A love that is all consuming and transcends language, trials and time. A love that grows inside you, hurling towards you at an incomprehensible speed with extreme uncertainty but is greater than yourself. A love that will cross oceans to do anything and everything possible for you. It's almost impossible to explain any of this or attempt to put in written language but Baldwin does an amazing job, largely bc the love showed in this book is so vast, multi-facetious, so different and so expressive... it illuminates each of the characters in different ways which allows them so much contribution to the story, without making it become stuffy and/or subversive. so so brilliant. Another thing is.. with topics such as institutionalized racism, police brutality, american history/racial dynamics, etc. in art, literature, music, films, etc. The humanity and agency of black characters are often lost or lessened because we become vessels of race, poverty, inflicted violence, etc,...However w this novel, the characters are really just living embodiments of love, that are faced with these things. Its was so amazing to read this and feel so warm and alive. I'm such a bandwagon bitch bc i read this book to see the film which was also so amazing.. but i have to rewatch it to form real, concrete ideas about it. However.. It was so beautiful and a lot of the scenes just took my breath away. Not in addition to the soundtrack which is so electrifying and heart wrenching, which im listening to as I write this hehe. Nicholas was so brilliant to push the cello as one of the forefront instruments, as it's known for its sorrowful eloquence and closeness to the human heart (aka love !) ugh.. makes me miss playing so much.. P.B.A, Eros, etc all pieces im going to learn when i am able to play again. Seriously listen to the soundtrack. Please. I have so many more thoughts and whatnot but i'm off to bed for work early tomorrow. Amazing. Definitely reading more Baldwin after this... any suggestions?? :))",en
312,38463,2657661067,it was amazing,"Although it was first published in 1974, James Baldwin’s classic novel ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" remains powerful and relevant today.At its core, ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" is a love story. The central storyline follows two young black people in New York City: Alfonzo, AKA “Fonny,” and Clementine, AKA “Tish.” The two are getting ready to start a life together when Fonny is imprisoned for a crime he did not commit. When Tish tells Fonny that she is pregnant with their child, they—along with Tish’s family—are even more determined to prove Fonny’s innocence.Both epic and intimate, the novel succeeds as an exploration of love both romantic and familial. But it also explores how love can power us through injustice, even when it seems all hope is lost. James Baldwin’s use of language is downright poetic. Although the novel reads quickly, readers will savor the language (“It’s a miracle to realize that somebody loves you”). Baldwin’s characters are imbued with such sparkling life and verve that they can’t help but be incredibly vivid, even the minor characters. Fonny’s mother, who only appears in the first half of the book, is a particularly complex and fascinating character.What’s most striking about the novel is how much it reverberates today. Fonny and Tish are two young, vibrant people seeking out the American dream. While they face incredible adversity, it’s inspiring to read about the hope that sustains them.While some readers may want a slightly more definitive ending, ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" is nonetheless a beautiful and important book to read.",en
313,38463,2519531715,it was amazing,"It can be hard to see the positives in life sometimes. Humans are an inherently cruel creature, capable of doing some horrific things. But we are also creatures of paradoxes and contradictions, because we can also create beautiful things out of nothing and show love in an infinite number of ways. James Baldwin is quite aware of this contradiction, and it really shows in his writing. I probably would have stumbled onto Baldwin’s writing eventually, but the double punch of “I Am Not Your Negro” and Barry Jenkins upcoming adaptation of this book has made this man very present in my life and current state of mind. Baldwin writes about morally horrific things in ways that seems hopeful and makes what would normally seem like victories become crushing defeats. Baldwin’s eerily realistic view of the true form of humanity is ever present here, and while this is ultimately a book about the human capacity to love and our connections to each other, an underlying current of cynical understanding makes everything seem pointless. The double-edged sword we call life is a dangerous thing to play with it seems. And after reading this novel, I struggle to think of someone who makes describing this mix of love and hate as naturally as James Baldwin.“If Beale Street Could Talk” tells the story of a pregnant 19-year old called Clementine “Tish” Rivers and her love for Alfonzo “Fonny” Hunt, and the two families struggle to get Fonny out of prison after he is falsely accused of raping a woman. It becomes clear very early on that these are people who can only continue this difficult path because of the support they have around them, so the book takes a very intimate look at human love, both for family and others. This is a book filled with the satisfying silences of family dinners, the inside jokes formed from years of being in someone’s company, the acceptance of someone’s flaws because it is what makes them human, the odd joy of listening to music while with someone you truly love, and the ways we can only physically demonstrate something we have no words for. Fonny and Tish clearly love each other, and it plays out in subtle and intricate ways, as each of them seem to fill in different parts of each other, creating a whole new being in the process (both mentally and physically, due to the incoming baby). This continues onto the family life, as each member is a necessary part of a whole, but one that does not feel the threat of falling apart, because they trust each other. The simple sweetness of the Rivers family is contrasted, however, by the failing Hunt family, held together by force of habit rather then proper connection. Of course, love still flows through that family, but the struggle to present it makes it seem like there is nothing there. Because a mother does not approve of her son’s decisions and chooses to whip him into shape using the power of religion, does that mean she does not love him? Through Baldwin’s superb prose it becomes clear that there is no correct answer to this question, but, potentially to our own harm, we still search for one. Our family is a part of us, like it or not, and we cannot help that we inherit the flaws of our parents, and that siblings learn by watching each other make mistakes repeatedly. Family is a finicky machine that functions by its own set of rules. So, what happens when we decide we want to bring someone else into this organisation, and thus must bring their family along too? No one ever understands you quite like your family, and that requires a lot of acceptance and trust. Baldwin is able to describe here how satisfying it is to see an enlarged family work together as a unit, and how painful it is to see everything fall apart in a very simple, but intricate style. Saying it is a joy to read seems wrong, considering how hard it can be to read at points, but from an aesthetic level, this book is masterful in its construction.As an intricate investigation on how love works within families and the people we meet in our lives, this book would seem dense enough as it is, but Baldwin’s all-seeing eyes cannot help but notice the inherent situation that is the American landscape. Community has always been a part of cities, so it can seem like another large family for people to deal with, but people are not naturally trusting of each other, and we are quite good at hating things. Obviously, this book deals with racism and its subsequent consequences, but Baldwin isn’t interested in simple “racism is bad m’kay?” messaging. Baldwin instead focuses on how intricately this harmful system has presented itself in our lives, and whether escape is actually possible at this point. Through this lens, everyone seems like just another victim in a repeating cycle, even the more monstrous characters seem like something breed by the system more then doing it on their own free will. The cops are racist, but are they satisfied on the inside? Is this why they act the way they do? Or do they just simply no longer care? Baldwin presents a few separate answers to us, and its all a matter of how pessimistic you want to feel about the situation which answer you choose. If you dig deep enough, no one really comes out as anything other then a victim. We are flawed people expected to manage a system that governs us all, of course it is just going to come out as self-destructive and filled with self-hate. Essentially, the struggle of this book lies in a simple question: do we choose to live with easily validated pessimism, or we do we try to live as the optimists we wish we could be? The struggle for balance between the two is a thing that we will always have to deal with, and as a result we will always remain flawed creatures. Yet in Baldwin’s hands, this just shows how we are unique. Through the struggles of the Rivers and Hunt families, the African-American experience in America, and the love of young Tish and Fonny, Baldwin paints a kaleidoscope of human suffering, pain, isolation, happiness, hope, and love. So, in the end, is Baldwin’s novel a statement on how love can unite us, or a cynical explanation on how flawed we are as people? Well, why can’t it be both?",en
314,38463,2682388655,it was amazing,"Well, my Brooklyn cousin, a prodigious reader of fiction, asserted forcefully that this was one of the best books he had ever read, so I approached it with caution. And in fact, Baldwin's tale of two childhoods, two families, one love marked by tragedy, though not the one expected so there is also an intellectually-satisfying element of surprise in the plot that satisfies the intelligence, is truly fine. It's tricky for me to say what makes this novel so good. Yes, there is the interesting time and place, which is Harlem in the early seventies, and yes, there are the racial issues, so stubborn that they cling to us well into the twenty-first century. But I also think it is in the way Baldwin tells the story. The narrators' perspective keeps shifting through various levels of past, present and feared future, in no particular logical order, at least that I discerned. In doing that, Baldwin shows us the way our own minds work on the inside as we tell ourselves the story of our lives. The result is coherent and complex both. The read is short and the benefit great. Give it a try.",en

It was a VERY fast and sweet little read, and I am super excited to watch the movie now because I'm sure it's going to be amazing. The story is really great, and I even really liked the writing. But I was never super invested the whole time. This story is of Tish and Fonny. We find out that Tish is pregnant, and Fonny unfortunately is in jail for something we learn a little later on in the novel. That's pretty much all I can tell you without giving anything away, but I love Tish and Fonny though SO MUCH, and they were the cutest lil couple to read about. I love how involved Tish's family was in their lives and the baby's life. It was very interesting to read of the projects in Harlem, how strong of a bond the family had, and how strong the love is that Fonny and Tish felt for one another.

If Beale Street Could Talk is a beautifully written short novel about the strength of love in the face of injustice. My heart hurt for this young couple that wanted to build a life together, but was unable to do so merely because of the color of their skin. Throughout the story, we see elements of hope, love, endurance, and perseverance. Although it was written over a decade ago, the themes of injustice, racism, and police brutality rings very true today.

320,38463,2609380424,liked it,"3.75. A dark look at the sad state of our justice system and a commentary about racism in America. This is about Tish and Fonny, who are a young black couple living in New York City in the early 1970s when Fonny is accused of raping this woman and is sent to prison. The story is about how Tish and her family are affected by this and how they fight to try to release Fonny from prison. What rubbed me the wrong way was that there wasn’t chapter breaks, instead the novel is broken into two sections. The first section taking 90% of the novel and the final section (named Zion ironically) taking the last 10%. I often found in hard to renter the story after putting it down because of the section breaks. Since Baldwin has been dead for a while this can’t be changed. My other gripe is the open ended ness of the ending. The reader never gets definitive proof of Fonny’s innocence, and never get to see him tried. The reader is left with the decision to decide Fonny’s fate, if he rots in prison or eventually becomes a free man. The only ending readers are given is that Tish (our narrator) has a baby and Fonny’s dad frank has killed himself after being fired from his job and threatened with prison time. Beautifully written, but just too sad. ",en

The desperation coincides with a visceral hope, hope in the love of all the people that keep us alive, characters trying to stumble their way towards a light that might not exist. And all this, in the midst of a rich, insightful prose. I will definitely have to check out more of Baldwin, as well as the film adaptation of this novel (God bless Barry Jenkins).",en

I enjoy less heavy books. But I really dug the experience I felt while listening to this story walking through the streets of Brooklyn.

I didn’t like that I had to read 92 pages before I found out why Fonny was in jail.

The way that act of family and joy becomes an act of resistance against a broken system.The reading, by Bahni Turpin, was also excellent.

I also loved the setting in 1970s Harlem, even recognizing streets and stores that still exist there today. I can't wait to see the movie now, which is winning all kinds of awards. ",en

There were some moments that really rang true to me - from Tish’s feelings during/about pregnancy to the biased way a cop can set up a lineup to favor a suspect. (Criminal defense nerd alert!) But, the plot felt kind of... superficial? And the observations on life, men vs. women kind of... meh? And my public defender heart just bled for Daniel, though no other character seemed concerned for him in the least. The whole book is just Fonny Fonny Fonny, and no one could spare a moment to worry about what was happening to Daniel? ",en

I adore Baldwin's essays, and all his central themes - love and reciprocated love as the answer, freedom, the ""weight of the white man"" on African-Americans, American mythologies of race - are here. I nevertheless found this novel disappointing and will try to put my finger on why it didn't fully work for me. (Later later later...)",en

Gentle, not so much in subject matter, as the realities Baldwin's characters face are harsh and intractable. But gentle in that the language is poetic, that there is this swell of love and grit at the center, and it is persistent. Formally, I loved the use of repetition, and the way naming works in the book, but that is for a much longer review than this. Can't wait to see the film interpretation! ",en
338,38463,2686204189,it was amazing,"Baldwin's imagery and character development, compels us to open our hearts. He creates a relationship between the reader and each character. Even the darkest characters have a human quality you, remarkably, can relate to. It is once we are vulnerable for these characters, that he brings the gravity of the situation into true form and hits us with it. It is a difficult and complex jigsaw of feelings, but they must be explored. ",en
339,38463,2697541953,it was amazing,"If Beale Street Could Talk is an unconventional love story about Tish and Fonny. Fonny is in jail for a crime he did not commit and Tish and her family are doing everything they can to try and get him out. Newly pregnant Tish is also dealing with Fonny’s family who do not support him or her pregnancy. Two things stick out in this story. The first is the presence of strong female characters. Tish, her mother Sharon, and her sister Ernestine are a force to be reckoned with. They are extremely determined to get things done by any means possible, especially Sharon. She is willing to put herself in unfamiliar situations just to clear Fonny’s name.The other thing that sticks out is the race relations if the 60’s and 70’s. These were still very tense times in America and the novel reflects them well. Minorities are treated as lower class by the people around them whether it be the police or landlords. They are not portrayed as extreme as they could be, but it is just enough to keep the plot moving.Being that this is my first Baldwin novel, it only makes me excited to read more of his works.

370,18304322,1314553375,did not like it,"This book is a hypocritical mess. There are three main things wrong with it:1. It was boring2. It's not body-positive for a book that's about body positivity3. A love triangle (boo! hiss!)Doesn't that defeat the purpose of this book? I would say it does. This book is vastly inferior to the spectacular Future Perfect, which sends the message of being comfortable in your own body in a far better way.The main character in this book is fat. She is also an insecure, judgmental snit. Look, I get that characters aren't perfect. I'm not perfect (gasp, horror, etc.) but characters should elicit sympathy in a reader and it is supremely hard to do that when the main character is constantly judging others whom she deem to be lesser and uglier and fatter than she is.
I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zippers in her size. Her eyes are too close together and her nose pinches up at the end. She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way.
It's hard to send a message of body positivity and acceptance in others when the main character tends to skinny-shame, however contrite she feels about it.The main character is an insecure mess, and not in a good way.
Millie and Amanda together are basically one giant moving target that says MAKE FUN OF US.Amanda’s legs are uneven, so she wears these thick corrective shoes that make her look like Frankenstein. (At least according to Patrick Thomas.) When we were kids and she didn’t have her shoes yet, Amanda just limped around, her hips swiveling up and down with each step. She never seemed bothered, but that didn’t stop people from staring. The nickname thing is pretty lame if you think about it. Frankenstein was the doctor, not the monster.
I don't sympathize with her. I want her to grow the fuck up and get over it. Again, a book should make me feel for the character; the only thing the interestingly named Willowdean does for me is grate on my nerves. It's not that I have a problem with her insecurity, it's that it is a constant part of her life and her narrative for a book that promises me a tough girl. It's that she is slyly judgmental against all the skinny pageant girls.
Cliques of girls sit at round tables with white tablecloths, the same ones my mother ironed in our living room last night. The legacy girls with mothers and sisters who have been crowned. Athletes trying to beef up their college résumés. The cheer table, which consists of anyone who does anything at a football game that doesn’t include a ball. And the theater and the choir girls, of course. All of them wear dresses. Like, Easter dresses. Precious little garden dresses with matching cardigans. While we are wearing nothing more than jeans and T-shirts.
Because she's so superior, being normal. Being fat.Willow is a supreme bitch to her beautiful, slim best friend, El. When Willow decides to send a message and enter a pageant (with odds of zero in her favor), El decides to join forces with her. United we stand, right? Wrong. Having her best friend with her is the last thing Willow wants.
“Have you thought about the fact that I feel as out of place here as you do?”“You have to back out. El, for me, you’ve got to. Let me have this one thing.”“What? Let you have what? You can’t pick and choose who joins the revolution.” She makes air quotes as she says “revolution.”I hear the logic in her voice. I recognize the truth there. But if El entered, she could really win. And that’s why she could ruin this.
It's like El said. You can't pick and choose your message.Furthermore, nothing happens in this book. Willow goes about her life. Willow meets people. Willow talks to people. Willow has a crush. All that's fine and good in the hands of a good writer, because after all, the majority of contemporaries are just about people going about their lives. The writing in this book does brilliant to make this book shine. You could skip half the book and not miss much. Most of the book isn't worth reading anyway.",en
371,18304322,1267675289,liked it,"Dumplin' might be the perfect example of why I don't tend to read light-hearted, fluffy contemporaries. Occasionally, my foray into this sub-genre ends with surprising new favourites like Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, but mostly I'm left feeling a little underwhelmed. Many times, I'm thinking ""yeah, that was quite a nice book"" or ""that had an important message"" but I don't feel any emotional connection to it.The thing about Dumplin' is that it contains a great message. Willowdean ""Dumplin'"" Dickson is fat - and no, that is NOT an insult to her. She deals with other people's judgey eyes but, for the most part, she doesn't care. She's happy with who she is and other people can go screw themselves if they think differently.
I know that fat girls are supposed to be allergic to pools or whatever, but I love swimming. I mean, I’m not stupid. I know people stare, but they can’t blame me for wanting to cool off. And why should it even matter? What about having huge, bumpy thighs means that I need to apologize?
This is an extremely body-positive book, which is a great thing. It's very much about breaking down stereotypes, learning not to judge, and learning to love yourself. Willowdean is not perfect and sometimes gets judgmental too when put in a bad mood, but she chastises herself for it:
“And who the hell was that twiggy bitch?” As soon as it’s out of my mouth I regret it. All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on. Fat. Skinny. Short. Tall. It doesn’t matter.
As well as this, it's very sex-positive too. Willow is a virgin but she offers support to her best friend when she chooses to sleep with her boyfriend and it doesn't turn into a drama-filled horror story when she finally does. Murphy introduces complex relationships between Willow and her friends and family. She also opened up an all new can of worms when she decided to include so many references to my beloved Dolly Parton (yes, I love her! yes, I have seen her in concert! she is a goddess of joy and inspiration). But more about that later.But I just think a book needs to have a little more than this to draw you in - it needs to be moving, thrilling, exciting or (as I thought this would be) funny. And it's not really any of those. I never laughed, teared up, realized something new, or wondered what would happen next. The pacing is slow and the actual pageant doesn't rear its head until the second half of the book. I like this book mostly because I'm glad a book with this message exists.Also, I understand why Murphy included the romance, but I never felt any chemistry between Willowdean and Bo, AND it did seem a little bit like wish fulfillment. I know the author wanted to show that big girls are not unattractive and have normal relationships and dates with guys, but did it really have to be a drop-dead gorgeous jock type? I had to roll my eyes at that one.But one last thing - DOLLY PARTON. If she is not currently your go-to playlist when you need a pick-me-up, you seriously need to get on it!

This book is: Hilarious. Quietly poignant. Provocative. This book contains: Nuanced friendships and complex families. Romantic moments as sweet as puppy dog kisses. Lots of Dolly Parton songs. References to awesome books. And it's so great to find a book that is fiercely positive, most especially about body image, identity, and self-love. The best stories let you live for awhile in someone else's skin and allow you to experience the world in way you haven't before. Being inside Willowdean Dickson's head is a joy, not only because it's so easy to sympathize with and relate to her, but also because that sassy Texas attitude makes her so damned funny. I loved the everyday experiences of the first part of the book, when Will is going to work and school and dealing with drifting apart with her BFF, and struggling with her sadness over her aunt's recent death and her mom's imperviousness to her feelings. Not to mention the KISSES. I wasn't as into the pageant part that dominated the second half, but it was handled in a way that felt both realistic and satisfying. (Thank heaven it didn't feel false or manipulative--or even worse, zany.) True story: looking up ""pageant mums"" will both horrify and delight you. I'm also super jealous of all the kids who get to frequent Julie Murphy's branch, because she's got to be the coolest library lady that ever was.

373,18304322,1251253402,really liked it,"Once upon a time, I was fat.I would have liked to use the nicer term ""overweight"", but who am I kidding? Almost weighing 70 kilos in my 5 feet 3 inches frame, I was fat and unhappy. I had big fucking boobs, big bulging sides, big buttcheeks, big arms, thighs that met together in at least one tangent, and the fact that my cheeks were already chubby without the added fat? Unhappiness galore. I tried to convince myself that even though I looked this way, I should still exude confidence because my physical appearance didn't and shouldn't decide my worth as a person, but after countless, ""Oh, dear! Look at how you've grown!"" from uncles and aunts who drop by every 2 months, after having to look for pants two to three sizes larger because I gained more weight again, after having seen your friends get hit on and try out sexy-as-fuck clothes and look so effortlessly fabulous, and you were stuck with pants and loose shirts, it started getting old, and fast.It came to that point where whenever I heard the term mataba (fat) or malaki (big), I'd get so insecure and anxious. I'd want to get out of the scene and then hide until everyone was gone. I'd start thinking how inadequate I was, how much I was missing out on just because I wasn't as sexy or as fabulous as other girls. I'd start crying to myself why the fuck I was this way. Why did my mom had to come from a family of big people? Who didn't my dad come from a family that was tall and glamorous? I struggled so hard during this phase, and it became that motivation for me to shed down the weight, because I didn't want these wordsto keep haunting me like a ghost that just won't go away. It was mentally, emotionally, and psychologically traumatizing for me.I've lost weight then. I've become confident. I feel better now in my own skin and body.But I do wish this book had already existed during that time of my life, because maybe I wouldn't have hated myself that much then. Willowdean is fat, and she doesn't care. I mean, she does feel insecure about herself sometimes (like everybody else does), but she is fairly confident in her own body, although she does struggle with the judging and teasing of her peers when it comes to body types that are not deemed ""beautiful"" by society. Willow sets out to change that, by joining a beauty pageant, and inspiring deemed ""fat/queer"" girls to join her as well.I loved Will's character and attitude. She was a mix of the ME I was back then, and the ME that I wish I was back then. Her insecurities were the things that I was anxious about on a daily basis, the only difference is that Willow decided to do something about it, and to prove to others wrong that someone's being fat is not a cause for them to not do the things they want to do. That just become someone is queer doesn't mean they can't win a fucking beauty pageant. That just become someone has a buckteeth doesn't mean they can't feel and be beautiful. This was a light-hearted book that talked about heavy issues and made them inspiring, enlightening, and so, so positive.I used to be fat, and I used to be ashamed of it. Willow made me realize just how wrong I was for feeling so, for letting people's opinions weigh me down and decide how worthy I was. Fat is just an adjective, but that doesn't make up the whole of me.Aside from the strong messages that was in this book, I was in awe of the female friendships and family dynamics that were portrayed here, and how much Will has grown so much as a character through these unexpected bonds. There were so many complex themes that played out between each and every one of them - the relationship between a fat daughter and a mother who was still stuck in her glorious days as a beauty pageant winner; between two best friends who come from two opposite sides of the spectrum; between a girl and a boy whose worlds are far apart; among four females who were shunned as outcasts because of how they looked. I loved each and every one of them, and how positive this book made them out be. Yes, there were drama, but it wasn't the exhausting kind where you'd want to haul the book into the trash can. They were the kind that tingled and pulled your heart a little bit, then warmed you all over.Plus, there's a ship that unexpectedly made me want to clutch my heart. A romance rarely does that to me.Dumplin' is something to behold. It speaks to every one of us who have felt insecure and frustrated with ourselves - by the way we look, or the way we act, or simply because by the way we simply are, all insecurities brought about by social pressure and norms. It speaks to that side of us who looked for reasons to feel confident in ourselves. This book gives that to you and lets you realize that at the end of the day, we're not made up by the labels society imposes upon us. I am me because of the experiences, values, and things that make up me; and you are you for the same reasons, too. Fat, or short, or queer, or straight, or thin, or healthy - who the fuck cares? Let's not make these things define us. Life is so much more than that.This book makes you want to scream, ""Yeah, I used to be fat! Maybe in the future I'll get fat again! But you know what? FUCK THAT SHIT CAUSE EITHER WAY I'M BEAUTIFUL!""",en

Because this premieres on Netflix tonight and I'm so excited to go home, put my PJs on, cozy up in bed, turn on the boobtube and shove my face full of what I lovingly call ""diabetes in a bag"" like my faaaaaaaaar removed teenage self . . . . 
ORIGINAL REVIEW:Most of my friends gave this one a “meh” rating, but I FREAKING LOOOOOOOOVED it . . . 
They obviously all read it wrong (j/k). They also might have actually ponied up some dollars for it, but it was gifted to me by a wee tipsy witch on Festivus Eve.Meet Willowdean Dickson . . . 
“That’s me. I’m fat. It’s not a cuss word. It’s not an insult. At least it’s not when I say it. So I always figure why not get it out of the way?”
Remind you of anyone?????
Yep. Me too. It didn’t take long, however, to realize that Willowdean’s sassy persona was merely a front and that she was your average, insecure, teenaged girl. And I loved her. In a world of YA where the characters’ voices sound older than a geezer like me it was refreshing to read someone so realistic. So what was Willowdean’s story about? Well, pull up a chair and let me fangirl tell you. Willowdean (or Dumplin’ as her momma calls her) is a plus-sized 16 year old who lives waaaaaay down South in Texas with her momma, a former beauty queen and current organizer of her small town’s annual local pageant . . . 
When not attending school or hanging with her bestie Ellen, Will works part-time at the local Harpy’s – which my brain WOULD. NOT. STOP. calling “Hardee’s” and I’ve been craving a monster thickburger ever since . . . 
(You’re welcome, fellas)Anywho. Needless to say, Willowdean’s day-to-day is not one filled with thrills and chills. That is until her new co-worker “Private School Bo” takes an interest in her . . . 
“My first kiss, which took place behind a Harpy’s Burgers & Dogs and next to a dumpster full of day-old trash. Yes, it was perfect.”
It was perfect until Will realizes that Bo will be switching schools and apparently their summer romance wasn’t quite what she thought it was . . . .
(*insert sad face*)And that’s when Willowdean decides enough is enough and it’s high time people get treated like people no matter what their size. How is she going to bridge the gap between fat and thin? Why, by entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant, of course. But she can’t do it on her own . . . 
This book may not have been perfect, but I gobbled it right up anyway. My only real complaint? The romance. I realize that the heart wants what it wants (thank you, Selena Gomez), but does it always have to be this guy???? 
(*cough douche cough*)Why can’t it be this guy every once in awhile????
Realistically, if I were a teenager again I’d probably be shallow and go for the hot one too so I can’t get too angry. Especially if he said stuff like this . . . 
“Willowdean Opal Dickson, you are beautiful. Fuck anyone who’s ever made you feel anything less.”
 Plus, when complete and total A.W.E.S.O.M.E. is also contained within the pages . . . 
Nearly anything can be forgiven. It’s time every girl realizes . . . 
“There’s a beauty queen in that cute, little fat girl.”“No,” I say. “That cute little fat girl IS a beauty queen.”
And then when you grow up? You can REALLY be brave . . . https://vimeo.com/125347592

""If you're gonna go, then goShe said to me on the phoneSo tired of hearin' all yourBoy problemsIf you're gonna stay then stayHe's not gonna change anywaySo tired of hearin' all yourBoy problems""
Dumplin' is about Dolly Parton and I opened with a Carly Rae Jepsen song. One, because I'm not familiar with Dolly's music. Two, Boy Problems describes Dumplin' perfectly. I'd wager half the book is angst over boys and romance instead of the promised pageant revolution. Willowdean is fat—and she knows it. She doesn't go on unnecessary diets to change herself and is comfortable enough to slip on a swimsuit and go swimming with her bestie.
""There's something about swimsuits that make you think you've got to earn the right to wear them. Really, the criteria is simple. Do you have a body? Put a swimsuit on it.""
Then she meets a boy at work, Bo, commonly referred to as Peachbutt because he's a fine slice of fruit on a summer's day. Nearing the school year, she breaks up with him because she can't stand the stares that comes with a fat girl dating a cute guy.Here's where Dumplin' falls apart for me. Based on the blurb, I anticipated Willowdean to be a sassmaster confident in her own skin. Instead I get an angsty insecure mess told in a, frankly, run-of-the-mill YA heroine narrative voice. I wanted punch and fizz and got milk and cinnamon. There's nothing wrong with feeling inadequate about your body. It's a natural feeling and on any other occasion, I would be thrilled to see it addressed in such a relatable manner. But it's not what I ordered. It's not what the blurb promised. For once, I wanted to read a book narrated by a heavyset girl who doesn't give two fucks about her weight or what strangers think. And joins a beauty pageant to show 'em fat-bottomed girls make the rockin' world go round.Willowdean doesn't join the pageant until halfway through and that's after endless fluffy moments and boring everyday occurrences. The pacing is ridiculously slow.  I didn't expect romance to make up a huge chunk and for it to be utter wish-fulfillment. Seriously, what are the odds of two guys—one hot loner (Bo) and a football player (Mitch)—being interested in the same girl? Willowdean leads Mitch on, let's get that out of the way. No, it's not a matter of male privilege. Willowdean has done squat to demonstrate she's not interested in him, despite pining for Peachbutt. They've gone on on dates, they've held hands, they've kissed—she freaking writes his name on her face in permanent marker to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance.
""I shouldn't but I move to kiss [Bo]. My nerves hum and this moment when my body feels both chaotic and determined is what was missing with Mitch.""
It's selfish, disgusting, and destroyed any redeeming qualities this book had, like female friendships and a positive outlook on sex.Ultimately, I'd compare Dumplin' to Meghan Trainor's hit All About That Bass. It attempts to promote a body-positive message, but ends up shading women who aren't curvy. Dumplin' had the ingredients for success and squandered them. What a waste of potential.

The characters weren't amazing, the story wasn't amazing, etc. I was really excited to read this because I love reading books about fat girls, but her size was rarely mentioned. I know the book isn't supposed to focus on her weight, but I found it a little less relatable than i'd like because it failed to give descriptions of her size. Like at one point near the end of the book, it was talking about how she pulled her knees up to her chest and the fat girl in me just went nuh-uh. my knees haven't touched my chest in 17 years. But anyway, this book was just forgettable, and it makes me sad because I was really looking forward to this. Nothing about it was grand and spectacular, and although I liked the writing style, I wish it could have been tweaked to pack more of a punch. The beauty pagaent that this book centers around took place in like 20 pages and there was barely any explanation about it. I would still suggest reading this, but if this is one of your most anticipated books of 2015 like it was for me, you might work on lowering those expectations right about now.",en

“Find out who you are and do it on purpose” -Dolly Parton 

Dumplin’ was one of those books I devoured. When I listen to an audio book, I know I’m really into it when I have great books sitting on my kindle waiting for me to read, but I’m finding inconsequential tasks to do around the house just so I can listen. It took me less than 2 days to listen to this book, which is super fast for me. There are so many parts in this story that were relatable to me. I adored our heroine, Ms. Willowdean Dixon. Our leading lady has an ex-beauty queen mother, her best friend Ellen, and an addiction to all things Dolly Parton. She’s in high school and has just recently started working at Harpy’s, a local fast food joint. It’s there that she meets Bo. Bo used to be a jock and is someone Will is attracted to. She’s shocked when she finds out he likes her too. This story has an element of romance, which I loved, but that’s not what the story was about. It was, more than anything, a story of acceptance and self discovery. Willowdean doesn’t have the same body most of her friends do. I wouldn’t say she’s fine or happy with it, she has insecurities just like everyone else, but slowly she embraces who she is. She realizes that no one has the right to comment on anyones body but their own. 
“All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on.” 
Will decides, to prove a point, she will enter the beauty pageant her mother once won and helps run every year. Along with a fun group of misfit girls from her high school, she makes a stand. I grew to love this group of girls and the effect they had on Willowdean. There was so much I loved about this book. I could feel all of Will’s insecurities as if they were my own. I loved watching her grown and triumph. It was a pretty perfect story. If only the ending wasn’t so rushed. I feel as a romance reader, I’m pretty spoiled when it comes to epic HEA’s and fantastic epilogues. And I liked the way it ended, I did… but I wanted more! Either way, this was a great read. Probably one of the best YA’s I’ve read this year. If it wasn’t for the ending not giving me as much as I wanted, it would have been a 5.

So I always figure why not get it out of the way? and I know that fat girls are supposed to be allergic to pools or whatever, but I love swimming… I know people stare, but they can’t blame me for wanting to cool off…What about having huge, bumpy thighs means that I need to apologize? Slowly turned into…constant judgement ???!!??I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zippers in her size. Her eyes are too close together and her nose pinches up at the end. She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way. Which ultimately turned into. . . My Scientific Opinion: This place is a shithole and all the girls who work here are vapid skanks who treat me like El’s charity case friend.

I won’t be one-half of the couple who everyone stares at and asks, //How did she get him?// Omg a hot guy likes you??? But you don’t want him to like you in public??? You won’t even tell your best friend about him bc your jealous she’s making friends besides you ??? and then you blame it on the guy bc CLEARLY he’s at fault???hmmmm10/10 rational thinking going on here. Also love triangle warning ahead. Not only is this fabulous girl able to score her smokin’ hot crush but one of the FOOTBALL players is also checking her out, is there ANYTHING this girl, CAN’T do??!!???Anyways, it seems to be a good book but I have 0 energy to put up with the drama that tags along.

382,18304322,1270418517,really liked it,"Well, WOW, that was a breath of fresh air. I was freakishly worried about this book because I loathed Side Effects May Vary. But you know what? Dumplin' was INCREDIBLE. There were a few things I was pretty squinty about (basically the romance) but it was so realistic and down-to-earth and refreshing and SOUTHERN Y'ALL. (Warning: I am Australia. I don't even know what Southern is. The ya'll's just amuse me.) Oh! Oh! OH! And the best part? It's about a beauty pagent so do you know what comes next?DO YA?Heck yes.(I love that movie, by the way. It is incredible. Also Michael Caine. BUT MOVING ON.)The characters are downright fabulous. They're not perfect, gosh, they're riddled with flaws, but everyone is interesting and dimensional. I didn't agree with all the characters actions...actually, Willowdean (the protagonist) rubbed me up the wrong way A LOT, but I can't deny how real she felt. I'm pretty sure any girl will relate to her struggles and insecurities. And gosh, she's a character. She introduced her self as ""Cashier, Dolly Parton enthusiast, and resident fat girl.""She's complex. She's really brave and doesn't give a damn what people think...most of the time. She's still insecure about her body, but -- she wants to be HAPPY in her body. She doesn't want to change. She doesn't believe she should have to change, and I really admired this. She doesn't run around being ""preachy"" but she stands up for other girls and when a guy catcalls, she yells obscenities back. Willowdean is the kind of protagonist I've LONGED to read about forever. And the writing? It's very detailed and vivid. Granted, this made for slow reading, though. I'm usually a speed-reader, but I felt I had to physically slow down so I could get all the little snippets. WHICH IS GOOD. I feel like almost every sentence was utilising the sentences and painting pictures and making sure I, as the reader, was totally embroiled in the story. It mad the characters POP too. OTHER THINGS I REALLY LIKED:+ It's not set solely in high school! YAY. Most of the setting, actually, is at the fastfood place they work at.+ It's hilarious when the mother (who is in charge of the pageant) gets all righteous about how it's ""not a joke"" and how it's ""so important"" it just reminded me of Miss Congeniality so so much.+ How there's a lot of emphasis on friends! And that growing different and up doesn't have to mean growing apart (though sometimes it can).+ And how it smacked down cliches: like jocks aren't always stupid, and the silent broody guy isn't just beautiful and sexy -- sometimes he's a jerk too.+ How the protagonist was pretty much a normal average person -- school, work, TV, tada. No eccentriciies. (Although I do love eccentric characters, it's nice to have someone more down-to-earth once in a while.) + Oh and there were tacos.Okay, but we gotta talk about this cringing romance. It's not a smooth-clean-nice romance, and I GET THAT. It's realistic! When society views you as looking ""wrong"" (like Willowdean is ""fat"") then you're going to be plagued by anxieties. But I felt Willowdean was just a bit pathetic about this. And deluded?! Like, she wallows in thinking now one is ever going to love her -- but she basically has two dudes by the end. I MEAN, COME ON. REALLY??? I always feel weird about triangle-type relationships, because one side is always leading someone on and that's unfair and cruel. BUT ANYWAY. So Willowdean meets Bo (which is an adorable name, and reminds me of Po from Graceling, whom I also adore) at work and they have a tentative summery fling. THEN THEY BREAK UP TRAGICALLY. Why? That is an excellent question, my friends. I have no idea. I don't understand what went wrong between them. And I was focusing! I feel like it was equal parts of fault...Bo wasn't communicating the boundaries of their relationship (like would they continue or break up after summer?) and Willowdean was so OBSESSED with the fact that she was unwantable, that she made herself be unwantable by walking away. Like. what.(Anyway, I could be wrong about my analysation of their feelings. It was just so confusing for me to read.)Willowdean is very self-centred. Which was hard to read about, because I can't really fathom how you can exist so deep in your own bubble that you miss what's going on. She has a mega-fight with her best friend (over selfish reasons) and she loses the boy she loves...all because it's all about HER?! I really struggled with this.But otherwise, I feel like this is a super EMPOWERING book! It left me feeling encouraged! It left me with an epic list of quotes that I want to just, possibly, eat because they were so good. It was just so refreshing to read about a girl who isn't skinny but that's not who she is (like she's not enslaved by food through this book, actually, no binge-eating or purging). She's just a teen trying to find her way in the world. And she messes up SO BAD. But that's also realistic. And the ending is unexpected, a little bittersweet, and heartwarming. Although the romance is TOTALLY left hanging. But whatever. I'm pleased with this Dumplin. I am.***NOTABLE QUOTES OF AWESOME ****These quotes are from an ARC and should not be elsewhere, okay, yeah? I'm probs evil for posting them here BUT I CAN'T HELP IT. They be so good.""There was some old guy catcallin' from the drive-thru. Called me sweetcheeks.""""Awww,"" she says. ""Well, that's kind of flattering if you think about it.""""Mama, come on. No, that's gross.""(Bless this Willowdean.)""Plus having sex doesn't make you a woman. That is so freaking cliche. If you want to have sex, have sex, but don't make it this huge thing that carries all this weight. You're setting yourself up for disappointment.""I understand that life after highschool is probably something I should be thinking about, but I can't picture me in college and I don't know how to plan for something I can't imagine.I take one deep breath as I check the to-go bag supply underneath the register. ""It's been a long day. Need some space.""Marcus mumbles something about PMS and to my surprise, from the kitchen, Bo says, ""Why can't she just be having a shitty day? You don't need to make up some bullshit reason why.""""You're missing out on so much."" She takes a step toward me. ""Boys and dating. That kind of stuff.""I scrub my hands down my face. ""You have got to be kidding me. News flash, Mom: a man will not cure my troubles.""I hear things like, ""so horrible"" or ""I'm sorry, but she's hideous"" or ""why doesn't she get braces?""That last one is the sentiment that stays with me all day because Hannah shouldn't have to get braces. Maybe she can't afford them or maybe she's scared to get them. Either way, she shouldn't have to fill her mouth with metal so that some shitheads will leave her alone.",en

I was kinda iffy on whether or not I was going to like the beauty pageant parts of the story but thankfully there were some good moments with that and also the other things going on in the main character's life.What I loved most about the book was Willowdean wasn't perfect. She could be shallow, cruel, and hypocritical among other things. I found it refreshing to have a protagonist who could act like a jerk. This to me is much more realistic than the usual way YA fiction authors write their main characters. It's like they think if the character is overweight than they can't have any flaws and they become these weird caricatures that don't really resemble anyone I know. It was refreshing to have a main character who lacked self-awareness at times. I look back on growing up and even though I like to think of myself as a good person there were definitely times when I acted in a way that didn't paint me in the best light. For most of us, being a teenager was not always a good time because you are this giant mess of insecurity, raging hormones, and a mind that's not fully developed. And even though you know might know better, you still act like an ass. And big surprise, just because you are overweight doesn't make you immune from being an ass from time to time. So kudos to the author for having a main character with flaws!I absolutely loved how Mitch factored into the story. I found myself reflecting back to crazy high school love life drama and remember exactly how it felt to be not just in Mitch's shoes but Willowdean's as well. It's not fun on either side of the equation. Overall, this was a really enjoyable read but maybe it's not for everyone. I guess it just depends on how you view the main character. Some of the characteristics of her personality that I found endearing, could be annoying for another reader. Not every book or character works for everyone, but for me this was a good fit. I look forward to watching the Netflix movie and also reading the followup to this novel which features some of the side characters in this book. ",en

She wants to try something that her aunt had always denied herself because of her own insecurities about her weight. Now Will suddenly finds herself contending with becoming a beauty queen, her crazy pageant mother, an angry best friend, two cute boys… and maybe a small revolution. Full disclosure, I know Julie, and love her very much as a person. She is also, however, an excellent writer. The writing in Dumplin’ is as funny and self-assured as its narrator. From the first sentence I was so immersed in the world that I felt myself dripping with Texas summer sweat. Willowdean, in particular, feels wonderfully real. She’s not cripplingly insecure, but she’s not superhumanly confidant either. Just like most of us! I loved her so much, and got so caught up in her story, that I had to buy an extra charger at the airport.

""I’m Dumplin’. And Will and Willowdean. I’m fat. I’m happy. I’m insecure. I’m bold.""
This is a book about confidence, friendship, and being comfortable in your own skin. It’s a book about teenage, growing up, and growing apart.Dumplin’ was a very impulsive read for me. I hadn’t planned to start reading it anytime soon, in fact the list of books I have planned to read is growing exponentially by the moment. I opened the book fearing the worst, that it would be an overly emotional story about a girl depressed about herself and everything she goes through, because I did not remember the blurb from when I read it last year, which I must say is becoming quite typical of me. In all honesty, this book was an amazing reading. I started it and finished it very quickly, the story moves at a great pace, and the protagonist is great while not being unrealistic.I can’t get over how beautifully realistic this book is. The high school background, the characters, the situations they’re placed in, and Willowdean herself are extremely naturalistic. Willowdean is an amazing character with a personality to trump all else. While being aware of her weight, Willowdean is never weighed down by her appearance and focuses on being the best possible version of herself. Of course, she is also susceptible to the woes of being in high school, and her mom’s endless efforts to make her lose weight. But through it all she stays true to herself and everything she believes in. She is a determined young woman with the power accomplish whatever she wishes, and I loved that Julie Murphy took the time to show us Willowdean at her most vulnerable to convey that no one, no matter how strong we are, can go through life without feeling the ups and downs.
""I think you gotta be who you want to be until you feel like you are whoever it is you’re trying to become. Sometimes half of doing something is pretending that you can."" 
The setting of the book is pretty typical, in Clover City, Willowdean goes to your typical high school with its typically assorted student bodies. Willowdean’s mother is generally the host of the Miss Clover City beauty pageant, which she won when she was in high school. And every year when Pageant week starts her mother goes all in with the preparations choosing to escape from the reality of what her life has become. In this book, Willowdean’s aunt Lucy is said to have died a while ago and while Willowdean still mourns her aunt’s death her mother seems very emotionally detached from the whole situation.Willowdean and Ellen have been best friends for pretty much their whole lives, it all started when Ellen’s mother and Willowdean’s aunt had once bonded over their love for Dolly Parton, who was a famous singer, and now both Willowdean and Ellen are also big fans. We see Willowdean and Ellen grow slightly apart in this book when the differences in their life become a bit too hard to handle. The bond between friends being a major part of this story, Willowdean and Ellen’s friendship plays a huge role in leading to character growth.We see new friendships formed in this book when Willowdean makes the decision to join the pageant. She inspire the outcasts or unnoticed or the most frequently picked on people in the school to join too. While doing this, her long time crush Bo seems to return her feelings, but their relationship is nothing but eventful.

I am not one to follow the book trends, I like to read books off the beaten path because I find a lot of hidden gems that way but this book intrigued me. The story is about a beauty pageant but the overall theme, ironically, is not to judge others, and to be yourself, love yourself, just the way you are!The characters are great and the plot was predictable but good. I watched the movie after the book. I think the book is geared more for teens since it is more simplified in every aspect. For a grandmother like me and having gone through many of the teen trials and the mother's trials, which the movie seemed to show both of these equally important, I could relate to the movie more. I was laughing one minute then my eyes were leaking the next!

389,18304322,1315364780,it was ok,"SO this rating is probably closer to 2.5 stars but I decided to round it down because, even though I enjoyed this book, it has too many flaws to be worth a three star rating. My main problem with this was that it was heralded as a book about body positivity and acceptance but it felt far from it. I found Willowdean to be quite a hypocritical character in general. Her internal monologue was filled with her judging other people; Millie, for example, who Willow points out as 'the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don't make pants with buttons and zippers in her size'. I was even more frustrated that Willow was annoyed and indignant when another student was made fun of. I honestly saw Willow as no better than the other students- the only difference was that Willow didn't bully them to their face. I don't think that saying she was ashamed to admit something makes it even slightly better. She judges other people to make herself feel better. Rather than eliciting sympathy from me, I was appalled by Willow for being such a judgement butt-head. Furthermore, Willowdean bragged about being confident in her own skin (yaasss you go gurl!) but resorted to shaming other people and their bodies. As I mentioned before, she makes fun of Millie on page three (!!!!) to make herself feel better for not being 'that kind of fat'. What? She also shames skinny people, referring to one as a 'twiggy bitch'. Having read this book, I now understand the comparison drawn between it and that annoying 'All About That Bass' song. The basic message seemed to be that being curvy is okay, and being confident is even better, but fuck skinny girls. I just couldn't get past the hypocrisy of it. (I should point out that I don't think Willow is a bad character because she is insecure or flawed. I am insecure so I understand that facet of her. I found it frustrating that she was so judgmental of other people's insecurities. It was a really unlikable trait for her character to have.)It also frustrated me to no end how when Ellen decides to be supportive and enter the pageant with her, Willow gets all shitty and tells her to drop out. Your friend is trying to support you and you tell her that her support isn't wanted. WHAT?! As Ellen says ""You can’t pick and choose who joins the revolution.” I would have thought that standing strong and united with your best friend would be ideal, but apparently not. I did enjoy the last portion of the book. I enjoyed the pageant and the drama surrounding it. As a whole, this book was entertaining. I liked parts of it but found Willow annoying like 80% of the time. I found the love triangle to be kind of unnecessary; her friendship with Mitch was great and I liked it but I don't think complicating it with romance achieved anything. This book was meant to be about Willow overcoming the judgement to be her most confident self, not picking which boy she liked more. Some of the parts about grief and growing up were touching and lovely. Favourite character award is a tie between Millie and Ellen because they were awesome. I don't know if I'd recommend this book to people, but I won't warn them away from it either.",en

Do you have a body? Put a swimsuit on it.”  This is one completely adorable, funny, heartwarming and inspiring contemporary YA. I regret that I hadn’t read it sooner. I love the main purpose that the book wants to put across. People spend too much time thinking they’re too fat or too thin, eyes too far apart or too close together, teeth too big or too small, skin too dark or too pale. Perhaps it’s true that somebody else is always going to be better but so what? Nobody is perfect and yes that’s cliché but in order to be comfortable with ourselves, that’s the only way to think.  Every person has insecurities even Jon Snow (no matter how confident, handsome and haaawt he looks *sighs*) and that’s perfectly okay because what a dull life would it be if we all had been so confident and so sure of ourselves all the time. These inspiring ideas were realistically and genuinely portrayed in the story through Dumplin’, the main character who is gorgeous, fat, confident, funny, awkward, beautiful and insecure all at the same time. Her uncertainties about herself are what make her human. They’re what make her relatable and true. I love the statement that she made by entering a pageant. She rocks!The book is another eye-opening experience for me because I’m often guilty of commenting on other people’s body especially when I think they’re too thin. Simple comments like “You really should eat more” seems sweet and harmless to me until I’ve read the book reminding me that I am in no position to comment on anyone’s body unless it’s mine.

If it hadn't been for the movie, I wouldn't have bothered with this book. Over the last three years I've forgotten so much. To the point where I confused character names and their personalities.Upon my reread I'm actually surprised that I was even able to finish this! Willowdean annoyed me so much. And wow her thoughts were so cringey! For someone who preached body positivity she went against her word so many times! Anyways moving on. So I had many problems with this. I didn't feel that Willowdean's character development was well done. Let alone any of the other characters. The romance was also very cringey. And I didn't see the point of the love triangle. Most of the characters while having real struggles felt two dimensional. I wish we got to know more about their backstories. Would've helped to flesh them out. Onto the things I liked! The beauty pageant was still as entertaining as I remembered. Their girl's friendship was nice. I really liked Mitch. And how some of the topics that were discussed resonated with me. I would've loved to read about Aunt Lucy. I did like the girl power. And despite my issues with these characters I found them to be strong.I'm just so conflicted because there were a lot of good messages! But I never felt that they were done right. Mentioned and just brushed aside. Maybe that's the whole point. I still wanted more. And would've loved to follow other characters aside from Willowdean. Overall I enjoyed some parts and thoroughly disliked others. Regardless I still think it's worth the read. This was recommended by  Tash ! Click her name to see her review. When I had first read  Tash's  review I knew that I must read it! I was excepting to love every bit of it and enjoy the story. While I did not love it I did thoroughly enjoy reading it.Willowdean (more often referred to as Will) is one of the fat girls in her town. She has no problem with this and does not consider calling herself fat an insult. Every year her mother and a few others host a beauty pageant. Her mother is a former winner and still fits into the dress she wore when she won.The book starts off during summer right before Will and her best friend Ellen are supposed to go to grade 11. Will works at Harpy's a fast food restaurant. It is revealed that Will has had a crush on Bo her co-worker for some time. Bo doesn't really talk a lot he keeps to himself so it's hard to see whether he likes any of his co-workers in any way.One day as Will is taking the trash out she runs into Bo and he kisses her. Surprised she walks away. He sees her again and apologizes for randomly kissing her and claims that he has some personal stuff going on therefore it would be best not to date anyone. While she isn't happy to hear this she doesn't protest. The next day however he kisses her again. They have a secret relationship for 2 months. No one knows about their relationship and they keep it that way. At that point I was ready to stop reading because the relationship between the two of them was odd and didn't really make sense. But because I bought it and hoping it would get better I read on. I am pretty happy that I did that as it did turn out to be a good story.School is right around the corner so Will assumes that whatever she and Bo have will do done and over with soon. While dropping Ellen to get her payroll she runs into Bo and his family. His stepmother reveals that Bo will start going to Will's school. Will is shocked that she never heard this from Bo. And she can't imagine going to school with him as well as working together.Things aren't so great with her relationship with her mother or Ellen. She feels that her and Ellen are drifting apart mostly because of Ellen's co-worker and new friend Callie who pities Will for being fat. Her aunt passed away recently so it's been hard on both her mother and her. Will felt that her aunt understood her in a way her mother never does. Her aunt and her bonded over some of the silly things her mother said. Her mother is not happy about Will being fat and she tries to subtly push her into losing weight. She does this because she thinks her Will is going to be happier if she loses weight.Now with school beginning the pageant is also right around the corner. Which Will is not at all excited about. She hates the pageant and everything it stands for. After seeing Bo in her history class she decides to quit her job and apply for another one.In a way of moving on from Bo she agrees to go on a date with Mitch who is in her english class. When this fails she enters the pageant. Her entering the pageant inspires 3 other girls to enter with her.This is probably one of the most inspiring books I have ever read! I loved that Will decided to enter the pageant for her aunt and herself. I would have liked to read more about the pageant. I felt that some points in the book the story really dragged. I really did not like how some of the characters tried to shove it down Will's throat that if she lost weight she would be happy. While a lot of people are pretty happy when they lose weight that does not mean that they weren't happy before. This is the case with me. I couldn't really see Will working out with Bo nor Mitch. I was also impressed by the fact that Will did not feel the need to lose weight for the pageant. It was really sweet to read about the other girls entering with her. The friendship was awesome! As well as how complex the characters were and the journey all the girls took with the pageant. I liked how Will repaired her relationship with Ellen and her mother. I was not excepting the book to end the way it did. Kudos to the author for doing something unexpected. Overall this was a really good book! I recommend it to fans of contemporary, Dolly Parton, and anyone looking for an inspiring/empowering book.",en

""I’m fat. It’s not a cuss word. It’s not an insult. At least it’s not when I say it.""
I love this charming book about courage, set in South Texas with a Dolly Parton soundtrack. I was gonna say body image, but truth is, body image is not the central theme of this book. It figures some of course, but it’s more about the courage to retain your shape when the world dictates you to be another.Willowdean Dickson,Dumplin' to her former beauty queen Mom, is completely fine being fat (not a pejorative term). She’s happy with the fact that she wears drawstring skirts instead of pants for her Harpy’s uniform and being a third-wheel to her bestfriend, El and secretly crushing on fry-cook hottie Private School Bo. She's content with her life until she starts having make-out sessions with Private School Bo. Instead of getting that confidence boost when a crush likes you back, Will finds herself sunk in self-doubt and insecurity.At this point in the book, I also began to doubt myself, am I really as open-minded as I think I am, or am I just a bloody hypocrite? When Bo shows the tiniest bit of interest in Will, I was immediately suspicious of him and was waiting for the big reveal of his ulterior motive, because why else would a hot former jock with sleeve-popping biceps be interested in a fat girl? When a “safer”option in the form of a shy, sweet, plain guy was given to Will, I rooted for him instead
“I terrify you”? The thought of it makes me feel bad, but it’s kind of nice, too. To not feel like the one who’s about the jump out of their skin all the time.”
Yes, I am a hypocrite, it is a bitter pill to swallow while reading this otherwise empowering novel. Good thing Julie Murphy isn’t like me, she believes that the fat, the unevenly legged, the bucktoothed girls (and boys) also deserve the hot guy (or girl) and the crown.In her quest to regain the confidence lost from her summer fling with Bo, she decides to join Miss Teen Blue Bonnet. With this, she inspires and alienates the people in her town. This is the part when we see how expertly Julie Murphy writes Will’s character. Will is level-headed, funny and sassy. She has quips like: “liberally spread salad dressing across my plate because on the eight day God created ranch dressing”, but she gets angry when her mother suggests diet and exercise, and she also holds certain prejudice against girls who are fatter than she is. In short, Will is a wonderfully complex character and a witty narrator.

397,18304322,1386442705,,"Earlier this summer, I talked about fat phobia in YA and noted that I hadn’t yet read Dumplin’ but had read a lot of positive reviews of it. It’s everything I wanted and more. This is a book where Willowdean, a fat girl who knows she’s fat and owns her body as such, but it’s a story about grief, about family, and about Dolly Parton impersonators. There is a sweet relationship that develops here, and I thought the experiences Willowdean had as a fat girl were realistic, honest, and vulnerable — a key element that so many of these books lack.Willowdean has a real voice, and her voice isn’t 100% confident all the time. Despite being comfortable in her own skin, she has moments of absolutely feeling crushed beneath the expectations the world around her has for her and her body. And those things rang so painfully, authentically true.We rarely get stories where the fat girl gets to be funny, have friendships, have romances, and have challenges unrelated to her body/”health” of her body. More, we rarely get them where the voice is key. And that’s because as a society, we silence fat people. We make them invisible. We make them make themselves disappear (and I say this as someone who has certainly seen the looks people give when you are climbing into an airplane seat or a bus seat and are made to shrink yourself, as to not take up space that you paid for and can fit perfectly within). So that Murphy gives Willowdean that voice? That’s powerful as hell, and teen girls who read this….FAT teen girls who read this…will see that they matter. That they are seen. That THEIR lives matter and are important and they are welcome and encouraged to take up all the space in their lives that they need to.I only wish I could hand this book to my high school self.

“Dolly Parton is singing to some mysterious Jolene who she thinks is more beautiful and more worthy than her, begging her not to take her man. It’s catchy and everyone knows the words, but to me, it's this reminder that no matter who you are, there will always be someone prettier or smarter or thinner.""
This was a YA contemporary romance story, about a girl who thought she was too fat to have a relationship with a hot boy.I felt quite sorry for Willowdean in this story. It wasn’t easy for her to be overweight in a place that loved it’s beauty queens, and the way she felt like she wasn’t good enough for the boy that she liked was also sad.
""Things didn't work out? You ended it. I didn't even get a choice.""
The storyline in this was about Willowdean’s life, her relationship with her mother and her dead aunt, and her problems when it came to her love life. It was sad the way she felt like people would wonder why she was with Bo, and how she had managed to snag him when she was fat, and tried to sabotage the relationship because of that.

Willowdean Dickson is a curvacious sixteen-year-old living in a small Texas town. For as long as Willow can remember, the only things that are certain in Clover City are its yearly beauty pageant, high school football and the loyalty of her best friend, Ellen.The latter shifts when the two friends start heading down different paths. All of a sudden, Willow is forced out of her comfort zone. Although she’s never cared a hoot about what people thought about her size, circumstances suddenly make her question everything she thought she understood about herself.I really liked the “real” portrayal of towns like Clover City. They really do exist, and I was reminded of the Drew Barrymore film, Home Fries. The other thing I especially appreciated was that Willow was a character that many young adults and adults can relate to. I’m so glad her weight or size was never disclosed in the book; she was just a character who never really felt like she “fit” into the idealized body images portrayed by Hollywood or in fiction.I oscillated between sizes 10 and 12 in high school, and though I wasn’t overweight, it never escaped my notice that most girls in school wore single digit sizes. It made me feel self-conscious, especially in the girls’ locker room. Books like these and all of Ricki Lake’s movies are great tools that remind you that you have to love and accept yourself. Sure, that’s always an ongoing process, but when you’re working toward that…it makes you a little bit braver than you were the day before. We’ve all got an inner Dolly in us–let her shine!",en

401,18304322,2099594478,did not like it,"With all the hype surrounding  Dumplin' , I'm really sorry to say this book didn't appeal to me at all. I did find the premise interesting and promising at first, but by the time I reached the 60% mark, I was mostly bored and skimming the pages. I have many things to say about it, so let me just make a list of the reasons I  hated  disliked this book:- This book was such a fucking hypocritical mess.   Beautiful, he says. Fat, I think. But can't I be both at the same time?  What started out as a beautiful book about body positivity soon became the main character, Willowdean, imposing her judgements on others and insulting them. It started around 5% (that was quick!) and continued for the rest of the book. I didn't sign up for this.- Willowdean was so annoying. Like, I-constantly-wanted-to-bash-her-face-in kind of annoying. I completely understood her insecurities, but I expected her to have some character development by the end of the book. But all I got at the end was a love triangle and angst instead of the promised pageant revolution.- Pointless plot. Listen, after skimming the blurb any reader would expect Will to win the pageant right? It would be the most fitting end to the story and the most satisfying one, too. Fat girl defies all stereotypes by winning a beauty pageant, traditional territory of skinny girls with model figures. Fat girl grows into herself and learns to love and accept her body. I was expecting all of that. Then our main girl literally gets herself DQ-ed from the competition. She actually gets disqualified. And she doesn't even have some grand epiphany to show for it.- At first I thought Willowdean's mom was being a bitch by saying she didn't care about entering the pageant and was just doing it for fun, but by the end I was wholeheartedly agreeing with her mom. The pageant featured only when there needed to be some conflict or realisation in the plot. I thought Willowdean had something to prove and she'd work for it, but she didn't even bother doing a talent, or costume, or anything you'd expect of someone who wanted to prove her point. Halfway through she even quit on her friends, and then decided to do it again in the end.... honestly enough with the drama.- Love triangle angst. Yikes. Willowdean literally leads the star of the football team on AND yet still manages to snare her hot crush. Girlie has no thought for the other guy's feelings, apparently. Next.- Zero plot arc if I haven't said this before. Nothing is resolved in the end, everything was rushed to be tied up almost like the author gave up on her own book. Willowdean's life doesn't change from when the book started, she doesn't have any visible takeaways from the pageant. When Bo, her crush, asked her to be exclusive, she refused to be because she saw herself as ugly and didn't want to be gossiped about... and at the end of the book she didn't even say yes to him. I expected something. I wanted something to show that she had character development. And there was nothing.Oh well. But there are some gems in this book though, and I've highlighted them and made the highlights visible to save you the trouble of reading this book. Have a good week ahead everyone!",en

Where she develops an iron heart from all the bullies and then needs a boy's life to unravel it all. That's obviously me just sprouting out wishful plot devices but what I got, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.Willow is very judgmental about other girls and the comments she would say about others really bothered me. I thought she could take the high ground and not let anything or anyone get in her way and she does that. But she does it in a way where she steamrolls the people that she loves. Namely her mother, best friend and love interest. I couldn't understand it. She was always mad at everyone! And she would try to justify it so she would always be in the right. I was hoping for her to grow and mature by the end, but I wasn't feeling it. I like how the main focus wasn't on the romance. There was a lot of important relationships that included her mother and her best friend that I was interested in reading about. I just felt like Willow was always just mad at everyone and she was blaming them all instead of changing her viewpoint. Maybe that was the entire goal though? If it was I missed it. There's a lot of empowerment about being true to yourself and do things that you normally wouldn't do, but in the end, I just didn't really care about her because she rubbed me the wrong way.Overall, I would still recommend this to people looking for a good read. In my opinion, I wasn't too keen on the main character but that could always change for others.  Wonderful developed character relationships form an intriguing read, but all other parts felt flat for me. RATING 2/5QUOTESI hate seeing fat girls on TV or in movies, because the only way the world seems to be okay with putting a fat person on camera is if they're miserable with themselves or if they're the jolly best friend.I'm done being your secret.It makes me feel good.

I got none of these things.Will was a horrible protagonist who thought horrible things about her own body and the bodies of others. When a girl in her school asked the boy she liked out (when he and Will weren't even dating) she made nasty references to the girl's clothes and body.Not only that, she was also selfish. When Will finally joins her mom's beauty pageant to prove that she's not ashamed of her body, her best friend, Ellen, signs up too. Will tells Ellen that she has to back out because Ellen has a beautiful, nonfat body and she might actually win. Ellen naturally becomes angry at Will for being so insensitive.To make things even more perplexing, Will occasionally made some body-empowering statements or stuck up for some poor girl who was getting bullied at school. It sent a confusing message when the main character went from saying anyone should be able to wear a swimsuit to commenting meanly on other girls' clothes and bodies or saying she hated her thighs.There was also a cheesy romance that didn't make a lick of sense. Will had a crush on her co-worker, Bo, who was constantly sucking red lollipops (which made me roll my eyes) and unintentionally made Will feel bad about her body.
“There’s really no use in me trying to be invisible to him. There’s no hiding an elephant.”
Bo was the typical brooding bad boy who doesn't say much, is hugely muscular, and has perfect teeth except for that tiny, crooked ""imperfection"" in his front teeth. He was basically a cliché male love interest on steroids.Bo also tried to control Will and repeatedly asked her to be his girlfriend. What he said in one scene actually made me mad:
I pull my ponytail loose to let my curls breathe.“Are you trying to get me to kiss you?” he asks.“What? No. Why would you say that?”“Then put your hair back up.”Jaw slack, I stare at him, waiting for him to say something else.He doesn’t look away. “I’m serious.”I flip my hair over and gather it into a ponytail.
I wouldn't have minded a typical chick lit story if it had been led by a strong, empowering protagonist, but Dumplin' served nothing more than a meaningless, superficial story that I've read so many times before. It was definitely an easy read, but it wasn't even fun, harmless brain candy. It just seemed pointless.",en

I picked up this book in the hopes that it would be fun and body-positive ... but ultimately, it kind of lacked in both those departments. Probably the most disappointing aspect of this book is that Willowdean comes off as rather hypocritical, jealous, and selfish. I never felt much sympathy for her, honestly. I wanted to like her, I wanted her to be an awesome main character who gave no shits whether anyone doubted her or made fun of her for her body. But where the summary of this book seems to promise a confident and body-positive main character, the book doesn't really fulfill that promise. Willowdean is super insecure. Yes, at times she proclaims that she doesn't give a crap that she's fat, but the next moment she'll be whining about how her thighs are gross and no one should ever love her.That's not even my biggest problem with her, though. It's okay if she's insecure sometimes, that's fine. But what makes it worse is that she's always shaming other girls. She shames other fat girls:""I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zippers in her size.""She also makes judgmental comments about a girl with uneven legs, and a girl with crooked teeth. She becomes friends with these other girls, but it seems like it's more out of pity and ""because she's a 'freak' like them"" than actual good intentions.She's also quick to judge skinny girls. For example, her best friend makes friends with this other girl who Willowdean immediately deems a ""twiggy bitch"". Throughout the book, she is subtly (and sometimes outright) hostile towards the other girls who are participating in the pageant.To top it off, she's pretty terrible to her best friend, El. When Willowdean decides to enter the pageant, El decides to join with her to show her support––and immediately Willowdean is like ""wait no you can't enter––this is my thing!"" and then proceeds to not talk to El for like two months. ... What?! Some friend, eh?I was also not a big fan of the romance in this book. There's a love triangle. *long sigh* And it's a big mess. Willowdean just flat-out leads on this nice guy named Mitch, even though she's in love with this other sexy guy named Bo. She's not obligated to like Mitch of course, but it just seemed cruel of her to go out with him while she continued to lust after Bo.And Bo ... he came off as a little creepy to me. At the beginning of the book, he lures Willowdean to an abandoned elementary school to make out with her. She's literally scared for her life and thinking up ways she can beat him up and escape. Like ... seriously, dude? You couldn't think of anywhere else that wasn't so sketchy?But also, he pushes her away saying he ""can't be in a relationship right now"" and then halfway through the book he very suddenly changes his tune––he starts chasing after Willowdean again and being like ""I want you to be my girlfriend like right now"" and demanding that she ""give him an answer"". WTF? The love triangle stuff takes up a large chunk of the plot. Which brings me to my next point––I think this book should have been a lot shorter. It's around 350 pages, and I started to get a little bored after about 200. There are a lot of repetitive scenes. And the actual beauty pageant, which I had hoped would be more of a focus, doesn't even happen until the last like 50 pages. All that said, this book had some redeeming qualities. I at least liked that it was sex-positive; at the beginning, El has sex with her boyfriend and Willowdean is totally supportive. As far as I recall, there's no slut-shaming in this book at all. And for a book with a lot of girls in it, that's great! I also liked that there were some nice female-friendship moments. I actually really liked Hannah and Willowdean's friendship. And I mostly liked the friendship between Willowdean and El (at least when they weren't stupidly not talking to each other for like 1/3 of the book).

406,18304322,1343600925,really liked it,"4 stars!All my life I've had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it's that if it's not your body, it's not yours to comment on.Fat. Skinny. Short. Tall. It doesn't matter.I loved this. It's very rare that I read about a MC who is bigger. And I loved that she didn't apologize for it or try to change the way she was, because she felt good about who she was.This book is about Willowdean Opal Dickson (though her former beauty queen mom calls her Dumplin'). She lives in Clover City, home of the oldest beauty pageant in Texas. The Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant. Her mom was crowned in her youth and these days, she basically runs the pageant in addition to her day job at a nursing home, even squeezing into her old gown year after year. So she is basically the opposite of her daughter. Will has always felt fine about the way she is...she knows that she's bigger, but not only is she fine with it, she embraces it.I held my hand out and introduced myself. ""Willowdean,"" I said. ""Cashier, Dolly Parton enthusiast, and resident fat girl.""The word fat makes people uncomfortable. But when you see me, the first thing you notice is my body. And my body is fat. It's like how I notice some girls have big boobs or shiny hair, or knobby knees. Those things are okay to say. But the word fat, the one that best describes me, makes lips frown and cheeks lose their color.But that's me. I'm fat. It's not a cuss word. It's not an insult. At least it's not when I say it. So I always figure why not get it out of the way?She has a best friend named Ellen, an all American beauty. Will is a cashier at Harpy's Burgers and Dogs, a local fast food place. She has a huge crush on a coworker of hers, named Bo, who is an athlete at a private school in town. She finds herself pretty surprised though, when it seems like maybe Bo might just like her back. But once she and Bo start out a tentative relationship, that's when Will loses her confidence. She feels uncomfortable whenever they get the least bit physical (and no, I don't mean sex), thinking that she doesn't live up to his usual 'type of girl'. She also starts to worry about what people will say if they make their relationship public knowledge.So, in an attempt to take back her confidence, she decides to do the unthinkable...at least, unthinkable for her. She enters the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant...along with a few other unlikely candidates. She's out to prove that she deserves to be up there just as much as any thin girl.Beautiful, he says. Fat, I think. but can't I be both at the same time?I loved the message that this book sends and think that it's a good read for anybody, no matter your size or age. Because we all have something that we're insecure about and everyone has their moment where they're just not comfortable in their own skin. I think we can all relate to that feeling. And no, Willowdean isn't perfect, but I think she is one of my new favorite MC's. She made some bad choices, but she wasn't fake and she stands up for herself and those she cares about, even against her own mom sometimes.""Mom, I feel good."" My voice starts out even and calm. ""This dress makes me feel like someone I didn't know I could be. I've never owned anything like it. But if when you see this--when you see me--you think it's a pity, that it's a shame I didn't lose a few, then screw you, Mom. Try harder.""This is my first book by Julie Murphy, the 2nd one she's written. But I will definitely be checking out her debut. She sends a powerful message with this book and I'd love to read more like this by her in the future.I guess sometimes the perfection we perceive in others is made up of a whole bunch of tiny imperfections, because some days the damn dress just won't zip.",en
407,18304322,1845898265,really liked it,"I'm almost sure you've heard about this book already, but if you haven't? It's a body-positive book about a fat girl who decides that she too has every right to compete in a beauty pageant. Contrary to popular belief, this book isn't about competing in a beauty pageant, rather, it's more about just accepting yourself and being proud of who you are. 
And it's not just about being fat as a girl – it's about being a girl and having something about yourself that you're struggling to accept or that others can't accept. 
Which makes this story incredibly relatable, because don't we all have something we'd rather change about ourselves?This book does not hide behind pretty words, it talks about everything in the open, even all the negative aspects (of both bodies and people's characters), so if you feel like you might be sensitive to that, maybe you shouldn't read it. But that's something I really loved about it. Plus, #OwnVoices.This book was a buddy read with my friend

408,18304322,1289909284,really liked it,"I received this book from the publishers in exchange for an honest review. WHAAAAAAAAT! My mind is blown away by this book. This is the first Julie Murphy book I've ever read and as soon as I finished this I went and bought Side Effects May Vary. First of all, A LARGER CHARACTER WHO IS RELATABLE, BEAUTIFUL, FUNNY AND REALISTIC. Like, can we get a hell yeah!? I didn't know what to expect going into this book but I was prepared for the common tropes like, ""If I lose weight..."" or ""I wish I could be as pretty as..."" etc. BUT IT WAS NOT! HELL YEAH!It was a fun, light read that dealt with bigger issues in a heartwarming way. The characters had their quirks. They had qualities I loved about them and things I disliked. But i loved that about them. Even the side characters, no matter how small played bigger roles. They all had a voice that was heard well. This book had so many great qualities like friendship, self-love, happiness and so much more. I could've read this book over and over and over and I just might do that.There were parts of the romance aspect of this book that I disliked. I felt that it was realistic in a way but it was also filled with unanswered questions. A lot of the time I had to check I hadn't missed a page because one minted Willowdean and the love interest, Bo, would be happy and angry or sad. The writing was easy to read. It was well enough to keep you turning the pages. Some of the sentences were executed in a way that you remembered. I cannot wait to read more from this author. It was a refreshing, YA contemporary read. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars!",en
409,18304322,1205459541,it was amazing,"Once in a while, you come across a book that you can really connect with. Not just slightly, but in a fundamental level. For me, Dumplin' was such a book. The moment I read the synopsis for Julie Murphy's second novel, I knew that I would have to read it. Though my expectations were high, I did not quite expect to be faced with a story that felt so real, so honest and so much like something that I could relate with.I don't know where to start. I feel like have so much so say, but I also know that anything I come up won't do justice to this story. Dumplin' follows Willowdean and her life in a little West Texas town during the summer break between her Sophomore and Junior years as well as the fall of her junior year. Willowdean is a lot like other teenage girls her age – she loves spending time with her best friend, she works in a fast food restaurant during nights and she is crushing on a boy she thinks will never notice her. But in addition to all of that, Willowdean is fat. Yes, fat – not chubby, plus-sized, big boned or curvy. FAT. And she's okay with that. But when things start to happen with the boy she likes and the yearly teen beauty pageant gets closer, Willowdean begins to question everything she has thought about herself and her place within her group of friends and in a more extended manner, within the society.Though I often find features from YA contemporary female main characters that I can connect with, whether is be nerdiness, anxiety or something else, I am not sure whether I have ever connected with a character as much as I connected with Willowdean. At several points, I felt like her thoughts were echoing mine so closely that I found it difficult to make the difference between Willowdean (the character) and Milka (the reader). Willowdean has always been fat and she learned to embrace it. She does not understand why her body should define her as a human being. Though she acknowledges the way people often look at her and her body, she knows that some people have it worse. When it is made pretty clear to her that people like her should not participate in the Teen Beauty Pageant, Willowdean decides that she wants to show everyone that beauty comes in many different forms. With a small gang of unconventional beauty queens, Willowdean embarks on a road of self-discovery and second chances.I highlighted so many parts of this book with my Kindle, mostly focusing on the way Murphy writes about Willowdean's confidence and thoughts about her body. I love how Willowdean is not afraid to use the word 'fat' – she acknowledges that it is a thing people notice about her and she's okay with that. So by calling herself fat, she is not trying to look for pity. Rather, she is trying to help people get pass the uncomfortableness that the word 'fat' creates – being fat is Willowdean's reality, but it not all she is. She is funny, confident and loving, but she can also be selfish and judgemental, and it is exactly that what makes her so real. She makes mistakes and does not necessarily acknowledge her flaws right away, but she is willing to do some self-searching and ask for forgiveness when she realizes that she has made a mistake.As a fat girl (yes, I am also okay with using the word fat), it is so refreshing to read about a character who is okay with how she is, but not in an overly confident, “I don't care about anything” way. Yes, Willowdean knows she is fat and she acknowledges that dropping so pounds probably would not instantly change her life. She is confident in her own skin, but she also occasionally feels like she is caged into a body that is too big for her. She questions her outlook and the way people react to her, but deep down knows that she is good enough, just the way she is. I feel like the fact that Willowdean questions herself and the way she looks makes her even more real because even those with a perfect body, according to the standards of society, occasionally feel fragile and like they are not good enough. Deep down, though all of these pageant girls look different, they all have the same worries, which can be linked to the way our society represents girls – nothing is good enough and there is always something that could be changed; your hair could be thicker, your boobs could be bigger or your personality could be bubblier.Murphy's novel made me come back to so many questions I have thought about before. Why is the word 'fat' seen as a bad word whereas the words 'skinny' and 'thin' are used as a badge of honor? Is your happiness directly in connection to the number your bathroom scale? Is your beauty and worth as a human being defined by your body mass index? Why should people with bodies deemed desirable by the society fall in love with people with bodies that are “unhealthy”? Can a fat person really ever be confident or are they just trying to keep up an act to hide their misery? And finally, why is the word 'fat' often connected to girls and women, whereas boys and men with bigger bodies are often deemed as 'big' or in some cases 'athletic'?There is no way I will be able to answer all of those questions. I don't think anyone can, mostly due to the fact that we all take a different stand on them. Unfortunately, words fat and unhealthy are often connected to each other – yes, some people who are fat are unhealthy, but is not all black and white. I am fat, but I also think I am healthy. Yes, maybe I could be a bit more athletic or once in a while skip those chips or sodas, but nevertheless, I am healthy. In addition, the word fat is often connected with the concept of laziness. There is this widely ranging idea that all people that do not fit within the normal standards of the BMI scale just sit on their sofas, eating greasy pizza and watching TV all day long while all the normally bodied people inhabit gyms and snack on kale chips. I think that the way Murphy writes Willowdean is so important and I wish that I would have read such a book when I was a bit younger and not as confident – Willowdean is hardworking and active in addition to being fat. She does not cry alone at home, eating obscene amounts of potato chips alone in her bed while watching TV. She goes out, has friends and lives her life. And she can do all of that despite the fact that she is fat.Though I have always loved a good romance storyline, I think in the past few years I have started to like friendship storylines even more. And there's an awesome one found from Dumplin'. Willowdean and El have been friends for ages – they know everything about each other and in reality, they are more like sisters than friends. But when El's relationship with her boyfriend Tim gets more serious, Willowdean starts to feel like they start to drift apart. Then new friends, the pageant and other things get between them and they get isolated from each other. They see each other every day, but for some reason it just feels like they cannot connect anymore. It takes some self-searching from both parties to find a way to connect again if they even want to be friends again in the way the used to be.The friendship between Willowdean and El feels so real. They love each other and rely on each other. Though the romance between Willowdean and Bo makes Willowdean question her decisions and the way a relationship between the two would impact her life, it is really the drift in the friendship with El that guides her decisions and makes her realize that she also needs to ask for forgiveness. At one point in the novel, Willowdean states that the only way for her to fix her life is to put all the little pieces it has been broken into together one by one and that the first piece for her is always El – not Bo, not her mother, not her image, but her best friend. And I think that is just absolutely beautiful.The connection between Willowdean and her mother is fragmented, and throughout the book, they are both to blame for it. I loved the fact that Murphy does not turn the mother into a villain that makes her daughter's life extremely difficult. Rather, Murphy has written a mother who has for so long relied on her own image and the way she looks that she fails to understand that her daughter is not willing to live her life like that. When I was younger, I remember that my mom, who has always struggled with weight issues, used to tell me that life would probably be easier for me if my body went hand in hand with the standards defined as desirable by our society. At the time, I thought she was being heartless, tormenting me for no good reason. Now I get that she was just trying to take care of me. I know there are people are lot bigger out there in the world and I am fortunate to say that I have never really been extensively bullied as a result of the way my body looks. But I know how Willowdean feels when she says that she does not see a point going to a clothing store when she knows nothing will fit on her. But like Willowdean, I also know that my worth as a human being will not increase if my clothing size gets smaller. I am happy with myself as I am, and if I even do want to get smaller, it will only be because I want it for myself, not because someone told me to do it so I would be more desirable and deemed more of worth.Bo is such a sweetheart – he begins as one of those brooding, mysterious characters who deep down is pretty much the perfect guy for Willowdean. He is a jock (well, more of an ex-jock after an injury) and the type of guy Willowdean has always though she has no right being in love with. She sees guys like Bo with the girls who do the pageant – long legged, thin and All-American. Even after Bo starts to show that he is interested in Willowdean, she hesitates, predicting the thoughts other people would have while seeing them holding hands. Why is a guy like that with a girl like her? Is he just pitying her? Does she deserve him? Though no one directly says these things to Willowdean, she can predict them. Yes, she is herself focusing on her body and their differences, but I think she has a right for it. What I love about Bo is the fact that he is able to see Willowdean as she is, not as a fat girl with a thin best friend. And despite Willowdean's hesitation, she can be herself with Bo. Not a girl with big thighs and stomach, but just a girl who really likes a boy that seems to like her back.I am head over heels in love with Dumplin' and I have a feeling that every single person who reads it will fall for it too. Whether you identify yourself as fat, skinny, average, thin, plus size, big boned, chubby, petite, curvy etc., I think there is something in here you can find a connection with. Whether you are confident or not, I bet we can all relate with the struggle Willowdean and her friends go through. Dumplin' is such an important, honest novel with a fierce, likable yet flawed protagonist, that I cannot praise enough. After reading this, I felt like I should be best friends not only with Willowdean, but with Julie Murphy herself because a woman who is capable of writing such an honest novel with interesting, realistic characters and relationships deserves my uttermost respect. Julie Murphy, thank you for writing about a fat girl who is okay with being fat. Thank you for writing a character who realizes that her self-worth is not connected to her weight. Thank you for showing that fat girls can have fun too. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",en
410,18304322,1294937939,,"There was a lot about this book that was absolutely fantastic -- the irresistible, irrepressible main character, the way her friendships and family relationships were portrayed, and the great messages about self-acceptance and not letting fear and shame and low self esteem and other people's negativity stop you from doing whatever you want to do.But I really wish there hadn't been a romance involved. Does the overweight girl need to be in a love triangle just to prove that she's ""worthy??"" I'm slowly joining the camp that is like LOVE TRIANGLE WHHHHYYYYYY? This is such a charming, funny, feel-good book and I adored it up until the point that that the romance left a bad taste in my mouth. (view spoiler)[ Why did she keep pining after Bo? He was embarrassed to be seen with her in public and just gave up on her when she called him on his b.s. I feel like she used poor Mitch and then kept pining after the guy who treated her like crap -- that was a big issue for me. I think a better ending for this book would have been that she ditched both guys and found a better one.

I wish women would be proud of their bodies and not diss other women for being proud of theirs!""  ----Christina AguileraJulie Murphy, an American best-selling author, has penned an inspiring as well as thoroughly entertainingly YA novel, Dumplin' that unfolds the story of a ""curvy"" high school teenage girl who after losing her self-confidence over her image enters a beauty pageant of her town to make people know that beauty pageants are not only for skinny girls but are also for ""curvy"" girls.Synopsis: Self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson (dubbed “Dumplin’” by her former beauty queen mom) has always been at home in her own skin. Her thoughts on having the ultimate bikini body? Put a bikini on your body. With her all-American beauty best friend, Ellen, by her side, things have always worked…until Will takes a job at Harpy’s, the local fast-food joint. There she meets Private School Bo, a hot former jock. Will isn’t surprised to find herself attracted to Bo. But she is surprised when he seems to like her back.Instead of finding new heights of self-assurance in her relationship with Bo, Will starts to doubt herself. So she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine: entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant—along with several other unlikely candidates—to show the world that she deserves to be up there as much as any twiggy girl does. Along the way, she’ll shock the hell out of Clover City—and maybe herself most of all. Willowdean is the fat and curvy teenager whose mother is the former teen queen of Clover City. That feels like it puts a lot of pressure on her image. Instead, Will is the most confident teenager of her high school who is comfortable in her own skin and has always been, even though she has a ""perfect and skinny""best friend, Ellen. During the summers, Will takes up a job at the junk food diner mostly because of the money and for free hot dogs. But when she meets a private school hot guy, Bo, who too works with Will, things change for Will. She develops an instant crush on Bo and eventually Bo too started liking her back, that is when Will is hit hard with her low confidence over her fat body. That is when she enters the beauty pageant to gain back her confidence over her ""curvy"" body and especially to put an end to all kinds of bullying. She wants to show the people of Clover City that she can compete with her curves along with the skinny girls. Can she do it despite her mom's reluctance towards Will's participation in the pageant?The author's writing style is quite sassy and is layered with funny anecdotes which makes the readers go ROFL at times. The narrative is light and free-flowing and is inspired from the way the modern day teenagers converse among themselves. The story is set in Clover City in Texas and the author has vividly captured the summer landscape as well as the sultry weather of this state. The author explores the value of friendships between teenagers, the relationship between a teen and her parent, especially about the expectation from both the parties and not to mention young corny love. While the main story revolves around the idea of self-confidence, self-acceptance and self-love. The author has loudly and clearly explained the message that, you need to be comfortable in your own skin and be able to love your body type be it whatever type it is, in bold letters. The characters are simply fantastic, well-developed with their witty demeanor that is both real and terribly funny with proper emotions. The main character, Willowdean a.k.a. Dumplin' as called by her mother, is a real charm of this book. Her imperfect body and her daring confidence made me her fan. Her amusing attitude crack me up with laughter. Her character goes through a lot of evolution when a perfect boy falls for her. Well, this situation is way too relatable for me, if an extremely hot boy falls for me, then I start to doubt my body, my looks, my beauty, my hair and all. I think this is a trait found in almost every females, be it young or old. Will, too, goes through the same phase, where she starts doubting herself which makes her participate in the beauty pageant. Yes, Will is smart, brave and funny like any normal teenage high school girl. Yes, Will is subjected to bullying, but she handles them with a class and that made her stand out in the rest. Will's story is believable and it can be anyone's story which the author has depicted that with lots of positivity. I kept rooting for Will till the very last page and certainly, and from my review, it is pretty obvious that I could not let her go even after the end of the story and when I found out that there is a sequel to Will's story, I can't read to read the next book in the series.The supporting cast, comprising of Will's mother, Will's dead aunt Lucy, some gay characters, Will's bff, Ellen, some bitchy divas, Will's crush, Bo etc are too well-developed and their striking demeanor leaves an impression even after the end of the story.The love story- alas- this is where things go a bit wrong for me,as it is comprised between three characters, meaning a predictable love triangle, although the author hasn't stressed too much on the love triangle aspect between Mitch and Will and between Will and Bo. The romance between Bo and Will takes time to develop which makes the love story worth while and in this age of insta-love, Bo and Will stood out among the rest. The love between them is cute, sweet and corny but in a good way and that definitely made my heart fill with a desire to fall in love once again.In a nutshell, the story is positive, very real, fascinating and motivating that is both funny and thoughtful. Will is an epitome of all those teenage girls who do not feel confident about their body type, and on a positive note, we must remember what Will conveys through her story ""Go Big or Go Home"".Read a short and exclusive interview of Julie Murphy on my blog, BookStopCorner.Verdict:  A must read book for all the girls as well as for the ladies too!

This book has been on my radar for years but it wasn't until I heard about the Netflix movie that I actually decided to make a plan to read it. I wanted to watch the movie not because of the book but because I will watch anything that Jennifer Aniston is in. #RachelGreen4Ever!! I thought I would love love love this book when I started reading it but I ended up just liking it a lot. If you've followed my updates you know I'm battling a migraine so I don't know if that has anything to do with it or not. I really found Willowdean annoying and whiny. I get that she's dealing with self esteem issues but damn girl project much! Time For A Tiny RantI know I'm suppose to think that Willowdean's mother is the ""villain"" because she wants her daughter to lose weight but she's not. Her mother's sister died (before the book begins) at 36 of compilations from being morbidly obese. Maybe she doesn't want to lose her daughter that same way. I don't know makes sense to me but maybe I'm a monster too! Rant Over! Despite my tiny rant and my rageing(I don't think I spelled that right but who cares) migraine I did really enjoy this book and it reminded me of my love for Dolly Parton, who's music I listened to while reading this.

413,18304322,1473278619,it was ok,"2.5/5 stars. While this is a somewhat cute story about redeeming yourself and facing some truths, I was very underwhelmed by this book. I was expecting a story about a heavy-weighted main character who decides to enter a beauty pageant, simply because she has the confidence to do so. While this is somewhat true, I don't think Willowdean, our protagonist, comes across as having much confidence at all. She keeps second-guessing herself, and worst of all she's very disrespectful and mean to people. I couldn't help but wonder if that was really her way of being confident - not hesitating from sullying people around her? I regretfully didn't find any inspiration in Willowdean at any point in the book. Furthermore, I very much disliked how Julie Murphy threw a ""golden line"" into the story. By that I mean that she often includes sentences that are supposed to be these philosophies on life and how we're supposed to view ourselves and each other. I prefer to read that myself between the lines and not be reminded of it as often as was the case in this book. So I did have some problems with this book which was also very much predictable. I think it is a cute story, but it's also very mediocre, and I honestly didn't like the message that Willowdean's behaviour might send readers of this book. ",en
414,18304322,2500361985,really liked it,"When I think of Texas I think of Matthew McConaughey saying “alright, alright, alright"":Full disclosure though, I don’t even know what movie that’s from or whether he’s even playing a character from Texas in the movie. Other things that pop into my mind when I think of Texas are the Southern belles, baked goods, rodeos and cowboys – I know, I know, I have a very refined and realistic picture of Texas. But I digress. While there is no Matthew McConaughey to be seen or any rodeos to be ridin’ (I know that doesn’t make sense, but I like the way it sounds) in this delightful book by Julie Murphy, there is a lot of hairspray, chilli (like the dish, not chillies that grow from chilli plants) and confidence with a good dash of teenage angst. Dumplin’ tells the story of plus-sized girl and Dolly Parton stan, Willowdean Dickson, who decides to enter the Miss Clover City beauty pageant. When I started reading this book, I thought Will would be a girl who was completely confident and comfortable in her own skin, but that was not the case. I don’t know why I had such an expectation considering the blurb literally says: “Will starts to doubt herself”. At first, I felt cheated, but then I remembered that she’s only 16! At 16, it’s normal and completely understandable to be uncomfortable with your own skin. I’m not completely comfortable with my own skin and I’m nearly 21. This story is as much about Will trying to move on from the death of her dear Aunt Lucy as it is about Will trying to accept and embrace herself. Will makes a few mistakes along the way, but I excused most of them because, as I said before, she is only 16 and I like to see characters that are flawed because that is what makes them real. As for the other characters, Bo was a sweetheart as was Mitch. They were both loveable in their own way and completely different from other male characters I’ve read in most YA novels. Will’s best friend, Ellen, didn’t really make as much of an impression on me simply because we didn’t get to spend much time with her. Other side characters, including Millie, Amanda and Hannah, were each unique and really well developed. So the character development in this book gets a solid A from me! The one thing that annoyed me was that (view spoiler)[Ellen, Will's best friend, becomes different and goes off with the popular kids (i.e. Callie). Callie is rude to Will and didn't have any redeeming qualities. This is a storyline I’ve seen in three other books this year, which is three too many. (hide spoiler)]Overall, Dumplin' is nicely paced, has a great arc to it and ends in a way that may not tie all the loose ends but still leaves your heart singing. Pick it up if you want to be entertained and see some realistic character growth. Not to mention, the Netflix movie comes out this Friday the 7th (look out for my review on that on my blog).

415,18304322,2649003574,liked it,"Read this as our bookclubs' January BOTM: Join us if you support Diversity in stories: Diverse Divers Book ClubTwo-Sentence Review (Just in case you’re feeling lazy to read a long one) Great writing, amazing rep and realistic characters who don’t wish to be liked but to be accepted for who they are: this is a good read despite the tropes it has that I didn’t like.I want to start by saying this book is really refreshing and liberating in a great way. I don’t think I’ve read a lot of books, especially YA, that has a plus-sized protagonist and joining a beauty pageant at that. ? I really like the messages it’s trying to show and I think somehow it succeeded. And no, I’m not just talking about plus-size-women-can-join-a-pageant thing though yeah, it’s a great message. As Will said, there’s no rule that says she can’t join. But aside from that, this book showed a great lesson on self-acceptance, friendship, love, and even family.The characters, though not all likable and I swear they made me frown more than few times, they’re very realistic with flaws and personalities they’re not sorry of. I also like that there’s no mistaking one character from the other and not just because of diversity but because the author did a great job at giving each one of them a different voice. I mean, every character in this book can be all whites and thin and you’ll still know who’s who. This book’s message leans on physical diversity and it showed that physical appearance is not what defines a person, their personalities do. For example, Willowdean isn’t just the fat girl in school who gets bullied, she’s more than that and she definitely showed that. Or Ellen, Willowdean’s best friend, is not just the pretty, thin best friend, she’s more than that in the story. But my favorite character would be Lucy, Willowdean’s aunt. She’s dead and not really in the story but you’ll understand why I like her when you read the book. I really hoped she’s still alive. ?Willowdean annoyed me sometimes, especially in the beginning. She can be self-centered, insecure and totally clueless. And she can be hypocritical too. But I forgive her because I do understand how it feels to be her. I was her when I was in high school. I didn’t join a pageant, lol, but I was the fat girl. I don’t think I need to explain my experiences. ? Also, she’s brave and really wants to love herself IN Her body. And when someone bullies her, she speaks back. I really like that about her.Another thing in the story that annoyed me is the romance. I don’t like it at all. Sure Bo is a good character, I actually like him, though to say I love him would be an extent. I also find his romance with Willowdean a little cute. At first. What I don’t understand is the love triangle. There’s a freakin’ love triangle which for me is not necessary. I mean Willowdean is showing the reader her insecurities (though she doesn’t let it consume her), so having two guys who like her is just too much. I’m not saying it’s impossible to have two guys liking her but in the story, this trope is not necessary. And besides, I ended up liking Mitch, the other guy, more than Bo. And the way the romance was ended isn’t at all satisfying so having such big drama in romance aspect seems unnecessary and of course one of the guys doesn’t get Will so it’s cruel. Plus Bo and Will’s misunderstanding around the middle of the story baffles me.But aside from the romance, I love all other relationships that were dealt with in the story such as the friendship and family stuff between the characters. The resolutions were well-done. I love how the conflict between Willowdean and Ellen was resolved. It was very realistic. Also, I haven’t mentioned yet, having that kind of conflict between best friends is also very realistic. Though Ellen and Willowdean annoyed me that time, still it’s very realistic. I also love the scenes in the last quarter between Willowdean and her mother. Those scenes were heartwarming.Overall, though I might not call this book a favorite, I still enjoyed reading it. The great writing and realistic story made this book an amazing read.",en
416,18304322,1369076799,it was amazing,"Ugh. Ive just finished this book and I am not sure that I will ever be able to accurately describe how much I completely loved it.This book spoke to me on so many levels. I have wanted a book with positive and accurate plus size representation for as long as I can remember. The insecurities that Willowdean felt are so accurate that it felt like I was reading about my high school self. The struggles that she faced with her body and the new found dislike is something that many girls go through. This book is so important for HS girls who are struggling to find where they fit. I wish that I could have read this when I was much younger.I loved both of the boys in this book… obviously I loved Bo a little more because I cant resist a boy with cherry stained lips.. like that just sounds delicious (inner fat kid talking) Mitch was also such a nice guy, I do wish that his character had been developed a little more though. But I never felt that this book was about her romance with either of those boys, I felt that this book was a romance with herself. I love how the author never focuses directly on the love triangle. Its very clear that this book is about more than teenage love. It is about learning to love yourself and learning that you are deserving of love from others. As I was reading this book, I found myself getting teary eyed over the most ridiculous stuff. I dont think Ive ever cried over Dolly Parton and Drag Queens so much in one day (okay thats a lie, I cry over both daily) but the thing that sticks out to me is Willow’s relationship with Lucy. I feel that Lucy was the only person who allowed Willow to feel completely at ease and thats why their bond was so strong, even with Ellen Willow felt insecure. I hope everyone has a Lucy.This book also made me feel super thankful for my mother, who never once made me feel insecure with my body. She has always loved me for who I am and made sure to make me feel beautiful (which I am, have you seen me?) She never once commented on my weight or tried to force diets on me. I will forever be thankful to her for my high self-esteem. Willows relationship with her mother hurt me so much, but I loved seeing the growth between them at the end.BASICALLY EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.THIS BOOK IS SO IMPORTANT.What I loved:  Bo’s cherry red lips Hannah’s snarky comments Millie’s inherent goodness EVERYTHING ABOUT WILLOW WOW I LOVE HER",en

I think that after reading the summary and getting so excited about this book, I set my expectations so high, possibly too high and I've ended up feeling a little disappointed. I was hoping for a book full of body confidence, positivity and acceptance, a book I wish I'd had as a teen but that's not the feeling I got coming away from it. (Which isn't so much a criticism of the book, more so a reminder to myself I need to stop second guessing the contents of books...) That's not to say there wasn't body positivity in this, there definitely was and it was great to read but there was also a quite a lot of judgement towards other people and their bodies from the main character, which to me felt counterproductive? I wasn't the biggest fan of Willowdean's character and the way she treated others, and the romance was give or take for me but having said that, there were a number of things I did enjoy. I loved the last few chapters and the Pageant (which I wish there had been more of) and I also very much enjoyed the fact that there was actual swearing in a young adult novel *shock horror?!?!* I really enjoyed Julie Murphy's writing style and hugely appreciated that at no point did Willow attempt or consider losing weight for her mother, the pageant, a friend or a boy. She stayed true to herself and her belief that her happiness wasn't dependent on her weight and the two weren't intertwined. Overall, despite having problems with this book, I'm glad I picked it up and considering the ending, I'm definitely looking forward to see what the sequel is going to be like! It's also made me realise just how much I want to see more body positivity in YA surrounding people of all shapes and sizes!",en

I've gained a great amount of weight in the last couple of years and I'm now on a diet and going to the gym to lose it all.

I can easily say that her inner monologue was one of my favorites to read. There are some really great secondary characters that were an excellent support to Will and the story. Everyone felt really fleshed out and there for a purpose; I especially loved the set of girls who joined the pageant with Will.

Willowdean is a kickass protagonist, and Bo is utterly dreamy. Being a big girl myself, this book was inspiring to me. It had words of wisdom taught in the unlikeliest ways- like from an Asian drag queen named Lee who impersonates Dolly Parton. One word for that- BRILLIANT. Willowdean's struggle with insecurity echoes one that I've felt my entire life, and it resonated with me. This story is one I won't be forgetting. One of my favorites from 2015!",en

The romance in this novel was also a favourite of mine but at the same time, I respected that it wasn't the main focus of the novel. This novel was about Willowdean and her self-discovery, the romance was an aspect of that.Definitely an enjoyable and relatable novel for readers of any age.

Willowdean Dickson (Willow to everyone, Dumplin' to her mom) is the big girl born to a Beauty Queen/Pagaent honcho mother in Fort Worth Texas.She was always too much of, too little of...to fit in.When she makes a connection with jock Bo, Willow has a hard time believing someone as popular or wonderful as Bo would want to be with such a fat girl.In a moment of defiance, Willow decides to enter the Miss Teen Bluebonnet Beauty Pageant to redefine the image of beauty. It forces her to face many issues she has been hiding from as well as finding inner courage to accept herself.I like that Willow wasn't a doormat. When people teased her, she kneed them in the balls. She stood up for herself and she was vocal. I loved the impact she had on others around her in her attempt to come to find herself worthy of romantic attention.I loved the supporting characters, her mom, Elena, Bo, Mitch etc. They added spice to this story. It just wasn't angsty or super emotional. The journey was even and smooth. While I enjoyed it, I can't say I was moved out of my comfort zone or to even work out to lose weight myself.

I loved Julie Murphy's debut novel, ""Side Effects May Vary"", and I thought I would like ""Dumplin'"" but this book was just...TERRIBLE. Poorly written and that ending was VERY unsatisfying. The protagonist, Willowdean was insufferable, whiny, and judgmental to say the least. She's so worried about everyone judging her, that she doesn't realize that she's judging everyone else in the meantime. No self-awareness. The whole love triangle thing was ridiculous. Does every YA novel need a love triangle? I wanted to read more about the beauty pageant competition, but it was chopped up and rushed the last 30 pages. If this was supposed to be a book about self-confidence and learning to accept others for their differences, then Julie Murphy surely wasted an opportunity in telling it. I must be the only person on Goodreads to give ""Dumplin'"" a 1-star rating. Wow. I wanted to like it. I really did.",en

It managed to pull off a number of character changing revelations, a beauty pageant and a love triangle without me feeling the cheese, and that's a feat.I enjoyed the main character, her personality flaws and development. What made this more enjoyable for me though were the supporting characters, especially the other 'unlikely' pageant contestation and Will's mother. I actually think this could be a story about the mum, kind of like in Ferris Bueller's Day Off when people think it's really about Connor.

And sometimes it's over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn't good enough. But you don't have to bother with that nonsense. I wasted all that time so you don't have to.”I completely understand why so many people love this book. All I knew about this book before going into it was that it was a body positivity ya with a hilarious main character and full of Dolly Parton references. And boy. Was. I. R E A D Y. But…instead I got this. It might contain everything I mentioned above but there was a few things that rubbed me the wrong way. WRITING: GUYS. I ACTUALLY LOVE THE WRITING. Welllllll. Mainly because of the slang. I could vividly hear these accents in my head without it seeming unrealistic. However, besides that the writing wasn’t all that special. I don’t mean that as an insult. I just mean that it didn’t have any flowery language that you had to decipher. It was realistic to the point where I can imagine SOME of these characters being real people I might come across. Others? Not so much. Which will be talked about more in depth when I get to the character section of this review.PLOT:Self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson (dubbed “Dumplin’” by her former beauty queen mom) has always been at home in her own skin. Her thoughts on having the ultimate bikini body? Put a bikini on your body. With her all-American beauty best friend, Ellen, by her side, things have always worked…until Will takes a job at Harpy’s, the local fast-food joint. There she meets Private School Bo, a hot former jock. Will isn’t surprised to find herself attracted to Bo. But she is surprised when he seems to like her back. Instead of finding new heights of self-assurance in her relationship with Bo, Will starts to doubt herself. So she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine: entering the Miss Clover City beauty pageant—along with several other unlikely candidates—to show the world that she deserves to be up there as much as any twiggy girl does. Along the way, she’ll shock the hell out of Clover City—and maybe herself most of all.With starry Texas nights, red candy suckers, Dolly Parton songs, and a wildly unforgettable heroine—Dumplin’ is guaranteed to steal your heart.The whole plot of this book centers around Willowdean who is a self-proclaimed fat girl living in a small town. At the beginning of the book she works at a fast food restaurant where she has a not so secret crush on her coworker Bo, not thinking he would ever like her back. Yet he does which sets off a catalyst of events such as having a fight with her best friend (Ellen) and a series of other things. After finding an application form in her deceased aunt’s bedroom for the annual beauty pageant Willowdean decided to sign up. Her signing up encouraged a few other “misfits” to do the same.This is where I have a problem with the book. Literally nothing happens. There is absolutely no resolution. Yes, Willowdean might of changed slightly by the end but it felt rushed. The pageant was supposed to be this huge plot but it barely got any time? And that says a lot because IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HUGE PART OF THE PLOT. I felt like we never got a good reason for why Willowdean wanted to compete, better yet she never showed any inkling on actually trying. The pageant was only mentioned when it was convenient. And the romance (between Bo & Mitch) wasn’t all that special. We barely get any development between them before Bo/Willowdean start “dating” and even less development as the book went on. There was nothing subplot with Will’s best friend Ellen which COULD HAVE BEEN SOLVED IF WILL JUST STOPPED BEING SO IRRATIONAL AND DUMB. It’s normal that we grow out of friendships. And there was this whole “we shouldn’t body shame” but?? WILL BODY SHAMES! I know no one is perfect especially teenagers but for every good thing Will said was replaced by something ignorant. The ending, liked mentioned before, felt uncomplete. Or that it was a cheap ploy to wrap everything up with an uneven bow. CHARACTERS:Will. Willowdean. Why. Just…why. I tried to like you. I DID like you for some of the book. But there was just some aspects of her character that made me mad. I’m all for flawed characters but she wasn’t even flawed. She was just selfish and arrogant. I felt like this was worsen by the fact that she didn’t go through a good arc and still was the same at the end, even if she came around in some of her ways. I also felt like Bo wasn’t that fleshed out and I couldn’t really get myself to root for them. Now, for the characters I love. ELLEN! MILLIE!! HANNAH! WILL’S MOM! These are the characters that got me to keep on reading. Were they perfect? No. Especially Will’s mom. But I feel like some of these characters go through a good arc or deserve more screen time. Mitch was…kind of like Bo. Not enough development, although I actually rooted for him sometimes (not with Will but just in general).To sum everything up:WHAT I LIKED:-the use of slang-DOLLY PARTON REFENCES + ALL THE SONG QUOTES-the setting!-millie!!!!!-how real some scenes were/how powerful some of the quotes were-it was actually funny at timesWHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:-will-the plot? lack of character development? cheap plot lines? take your pick-the romance??-the general vibe of some of the characters FAVORITE QUOTES:“All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on.”“There’s something about swimsuits that make you think you’ve got to earn the right to wear them. And that’s wrong. Really, the criteria is simple. Do you have a body? Put a swimsuit on it.” “And I guess that's when I decided being good at something didn't mean you had to do it. Just 'cause something's easy doesn't make it right.” “Isn’t that sad? It’s like the whole world has to walk around with name tags on so we can all feel more comfortable? I guess things are less scary if you know what to call them.” “But maybe Lucy wasn’t supposed to be your compass forever. Maybe she was there for you just long enough so you could learn how to be your own compass and find your own way.” She winks at me. “The universe is a strange thing.” “But the good news is that since this is the worst day ever, tomorrow can only be better. Even if it's by a little bit.”",en

I’m rounding up a tad on this one, it’s probably more of a 3.5 for me, but only because I had a few problems with it.I really, really wanted to love this book. But I think the thing that was most off-putting for me was Will. I’ve always had a hard time loving a book if I dislike the MC and this was one of those cases.Here’s why I didn’t like her:1. She was a HORRIBLE friend to El and when it came down to it, a horrible “friend” to poor Mitch as well.2. She was constantly body shaming herself and others while also trying to embrace her body and to me, it wasn’t just wishy-washy, it was like she was always trying to think how she assumed others would and it was just... mean half the time. (Like calling the girls El worked with Skanks in her head for being skinny? Or bashing on Millie when she was introduced)3. She’s incredibly selfish but I’m not going to touch on that beyond saying how selfish she was.Things that I thought redeemed the book:1. Millie. Why couldn’t SHE have been the MC? 2. Amanda.3. Hannah. 4. Our lovely drag queens.I feel like this book really did have a lot of potential, and overall I think it serves a positive message as it was intended to. But I also feel like a lot of what was in this book was too forced. Whenever someone cussed it was just tossed in there. The romance with Will and Bo had about zero foundation. The whole thing is based around the pageant, which lasted like 20 pages tops and didn’t do a whole lot for the plot. I liked the book, but I didn’t love it. I’m excited to watch the movie though to see how it compares.",en
430,18304322,1444045138,liked it,"Dumplin’ sounds like a sweet little nickname when one is five but no teen wants to be called a lump of dough by their mom in front of their cruel peers.
Willowdean has the unfortunate luck of having a clueless mom who does just that and can’t seem to figure out why her “Dumplin’” is so moody. Ah, the dramatic life of a teen.Willow has bigger problems than her nickname though. Her beloved aunt Lucy has recently died (due in part to obesity), leaving her alone with only her grief and her former beauty queen mom who not so subtly urges Willow to lose weight. Constantly. Mom is worried Wilow will end up like Lucy. Mom’s world revolves around the pageant and Willow, a self-proclaimed fat girl, has no interest in such things. But as the story goes along, things happen that shake up her self-confidence (and if you guessed those “things” were a boy, I’m sad to say you are right). So between the flagging self-confidence and discovering something about her last aunt Lucy that saddens her, she impulsively decides to enter the pageant and enlists a bunch of misfits into joining her. Sounds kind of fun, right? And sometimes it is but mostly it’s not.Much stuff and many things happen but none of them are earth-shattering, nor are they nail biting. If you’re looking for a lot of action this isn’t your book. This is a very “slice of life”, character orientated story. That’s my favorite kind of thing so I enjoyed it right away and the narrator was great, she voiced Willow as a teen and it didn’t sound fake. I thought, finally, a book was going to live up to its hype for me! But then Willow started driving me CRAZY and there were many times when I didn’t like her very much.Let me explain. Willow is happy in her skin when the story begins. She’s a big girl and she is okay with that. She has a beautiful, thin best friend but because Willow is so confident, their physical differences never come between them. I was loving that story and I really enjoyed Willow’s outlook on life but then, alas, Bo happens and things start to devolve. He’s her crush and her co-worker and has a butt as juicy as a peach. He’s also gorgeous, slightly mysterious and apparently enjoys kissing her. But only in private. Uh oh. Willow is smart enough to see where this is heading (or at least thinks she is) and dumps him without explanation and then pines away for him while leading on another boy. Her best friends says It best when she states, “You’re a shitty friend Will.”
It’s here that the more unsavory bits of Willow’s personality start to take center stage and show their ugly faces too much and the book loses a lot of its charm. Willow doesn’t always say things out loud but she most definitely skinny and fat shames, she’s jealous, self-centered, judgmental , insecure and unapologetically mean to her supportive best friend, to her mom, to Bo and especially to a sweet boy named Mitch (yeah, it’s a love triangle, shoot me now). Willow’s a teen and full of mood swings and ugly thoughts about her peers. I get it. We all have our undesirable moments but Willow had far too many of them for me. I thought she’d be above some of that shit and be a better heroine. Instead she’s just like all the rest. What could’ve been a meaningful read with a strong, unique heroine turned into just another ho-hum young adult novel. It does have its good points; it’s readable, funny, sweet and savage and real and there are some good messages there amongst all of the muck but I was hoping for something new. Something different. Something fearless. And I didn’t get it. Thus I can only rate this one a 2 ½ but I’ll bump it up to a 3 because I’m sweet like that.",en
431,18304322,1297185895,liked it,"This review appears on Happy Indulgence! Check it out for more reviews.After reading Dumplin’ and not loving it, I felt like everyone’s had a party where I wasn’t invited. Everyone’s been raving about it, it’s going to be made into a movie, but upon reaching the end, I still felt like I struggled to reach the point.Having a fat main character is the main drawcard of the book, and Willowdean (or Will for short) Dickson knows that she’s fat. But the book doesn’t talk about her insecurities a lot, or even how different she feels compared to the other girls competing in the Miss Teen Blue Bonnett Beauty Pageant. At it’s heart, Will is just like everyone else, coping with family, friendship and a love life. And that’s what I felt was missing.Will is confident, bold and hilarious with her frank, dry humour (and to be honest, I found her kind of intimidating). With an overbearing pageant mum, she goes through life declaring that she doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her. But when she starts getting into a relationship with her hot co-worker Bo, she’s overcome with insecurities, claiming that a guy like him doesn’t belong with a girl like her. I could see just how hard on herself she was, but the only barrier to her happiness was herself. And she needed to work through those insecurities, those thoughts before she could allow herself to be happy, but in the process, she pushes away the people who care about her.The book is pretty slow, with the beauty pageant not kicking in until the 2nd half of the book. I kind of thought there’d be more focus on the pageant, but instead, Will pretty much wallows in the insecurities of her love life and her problems with her best friend. I thought she would be practicing for the pageant, giving it her best shot, but nope. She approaches it as an afterthought, more preoccupied with the romance.While I liked the romance, I felt like we didn’t get to know much about Bo or Mitch, aside from their typecast “popular guy” or “football guy” stereotypes. Which is something that the whole book is trying to fight against. Bo is a really sweet popular guy, who works at the fast food joint. Aside from not caring about Will’s body, being incredibly sweet and having a well defined jawline, we don’t know much about him other than his attraction for Will and that he works at the same place as her. Neither do we know much about Mitch, the stocky football player who asks Will out, aside from him having a jerk best friend. I felt really sorry for him, Will kept lying to herself and to him with her lack of feelings, pretty much stringing him along.Peppered amongst the romance and the humour are some pretty wonderful moments, like getting catwalk lessons from a drag queen, the kisses with Bo and befriending the outcasts of the school. It’s these charming moments that I really enjoyed, that will translate really well on screen.In the end, Dumplin’ teaches you to be confident in yourself, no matter what body you are in. Because the only person who is going to prevent you from that happiness, that confidence, is yourself. And believing that you have the chance to do anything, like enter a beauty pageant as a fat girl, is where it all starts. I only wish more of that came through in Dumplin’. But we can’t have everything.With it’s Texan charm, pageant mum’s and wonderfully confident fat girl at it’s helm, Dumplin’ sets out to spread positive body image and battle against heavier girl stereotypes.

A primeira metade do livro foi bem interessante. Willowdean é uma personagem que, apesar de ter 16 anos, já tem ideais muito bem formados sobre seu corpo. Ela se ama, se aceita, tem suas inseguranças de vez em quando (quem nunca?) e eu tava gostando bastante. Da metade pro final, a coisa desanda. A protagonista começa a tomar umas decisões meio: ???????E a autora inventou de enfiar um triângulo amoroso ali no meio que, sinceramente, PRA QUE???????Sobre o audiobook: Achei legal escolherem uma narradora com sotaque do Texas (onde se passa a história) mas toda vez que um personagem masculino falava ela fazia meio que uma voz de homem super caricata e cortava o clima todo da cena, hahaha.

435,18304322,1304624874,really liked it,"15/6/2016I reread this for book club and I think I loved it more than I did last time around. Julie Murphy just GETS IT. The self hatred. The self doubt. The feeling that everyone's looking at you and judging you even when they're not. The ""but how can this person possibly be interested in me when I look like this?"". There are so many wonderful lines and beautiful moments and I just love this book a lot, okay?7/10/2015I...wasn't really expecting to like this book. I read Side Effects May Vary last year and hated it with a fiery passion, so while I was interested when I read the blurb for this, it wasn't something I was going to rush out and get. Until Amanda was like ""OH MY GOD, YOU HAVE TO READ IT."" So I did. And I had a lot of feelings about it. I feel like there are two possibilities where this book is concerned:1. You're a fat girl or a former fat girl and you'll get exactly where Willowdean's coming from. Her self-doubt and her defensiveness and her selfishness will make perfect sense because you've been there, you've lived it, you relate to her a little more than you'd like. 2. You've never been a fat teenage girl and don't really understand why she acts the way she does. I fall very firmly into the first category. Admittedly, most of my weight gain happened at university rather than in high school, but I was still one of the biggest girls in my year level in high school. I related to her struggles to find a dress that fits, to deal with wearing bathers in public, to how people react when they see her in clothing stores or buying fast food or any number of other things. And I related a little too much to her rather rocky relationship with her mother and her ""you just need to TRY harder!"" attitude... Willowdean's an incredibly relatable character, and the book was full of fabulous characters and funny moments despite being far more feelsy than I was anticipating. A breath of fresh air in the sea of ""I'm a size six with perfect skin and perfect hair but I'm soooooooo not pretty even though every boy in school wants to date me"" tropes.",en
436,18304322,1402129940,liked it,"???¼Dumplin' is a young-adult contemporary novel written by author: Julie Murphy. This story encompasses issues related to coming-of-age, death/loss/grief, family issues, self-image, society's views on beauty and weight, interpersonal relationships, and first love. The story was entertaining and easily held my interest, and I think it addressed important topics. However, there were some elements about this novel that didn't quite flow in my opinion, specifically with the romance and the subject of self-acceptance. Unfortunately these parts ended up impacting how much I enjoyed the novel as a whole. Overall, I liked Dumplin' and especially enjoyed the references to Dolly Parton. Her name isn't one seen in many young-adult novels so this added some originality which I appreciated. I would recommend this book to empathetic readers who like coming-of-age stories. Enjoy :)My favorite quote:""All my life, I've had a body worth commenting on. And if living in my skin has taught me anything it's that if it's not your body, it's not yours to comment on. Fat, skinny, short, tall, it doesn't matter.""",en
437,18304322,2606497367,it was amazing,"I saw that this was being turned into a Netflix movie and was intrigued enough to purchase this book. I saw it so much at the bookstore and never picked it up. I want to go back in time and kick my own ass for not picking it up then. I really didn't expect this book to touch me in such a deep way. It brought out feelings from high school and now in the present.I honestly don't think I can review this book in the justice that I think it deserves to express what it means to me. “Sometimes figuring out who you are means understanding that we are a mosaic of experiences. I’m Dumplin’. And Will and Willowdean. I’m fat. I’m happy. I’m insecure. I’m bold.” What I loved the most about this book was that it was messy. It was real and wasn't a sugar-coated piece of fiction. Was Willowdean the best protagonist? No, but she came off as a real teenager. She wasn't the most optimistic, or the best friend she could be, but she felt so honest and real to me. I see a lot of posts about how she was negative and they didn't like her views on people. I don't know what this says about me, but I loved her negativity. She's a teenager, and I was almost the exact same way. I didn't have good things to say about people in high school. It sucks, especially being bigger. I guess I can understand her negativity.The quote that stuck with me throughout reading was the one told to Willowdean by her aunt Lucy: “I've wasted a lot of time in my life. I've thought too much about what people will say or what they're gonna think. And sometimes it's over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn't good enough.""Let's talk about a few characters. Mitch, Ellen, and Bo.One thing I believe everyone who reads this book can agree on is that MITCH DESERVES THE DAMN WORLD! He deserved the truth. Even if Willlowdean told him that she had feelings for someone else, he would have still been her friend. And I really enjoyed reading about them hanging out and getting to know each other. Willowdean and Ellen's friendship. Do I think she handled certain things wrong? Absolutely. I also think that they needed the break from each other. It really gave them the chance to see what it would be like without each other in their lives. I don't really have any feelings about Bo. Good or bad. I'm glad he got his head out of his ass about how he felt about Willowdean, but he could have honestly done that way before. I felt like this book showed the importance of finding yourself, learning what makes you happy, and building a fort of good friends around you. This is for anyone who has felt a certain way about their weight, friendships growing apart, and just being a teenager in general. I can't wait for the Netflix special to drop on December 7th and I hope that it does this book justice!Blog | Instagram | Twitter",en

It’s not much of a success as I thought it’ll be. I’ll have to make up.Dumplin’ was hyped up in the community with the movie going on and the success that follows it. They were all songs of praises. And as a person who’s reading goal is to gear towards more diverse reads. It is in my list of to-reads, and a whole variety more of books to read with a fat rep. Since it’s been voted and won as the Book of the Month and I already have a copy in the shelf, I jumped into bandwagon immediately.Reading Experience:It wasn’t what I thought it’d be, it wasn’t that bad and it wasn’t that great either. Throughout the book, there were parts wherein I find inadequate-in a holey way. I feel that certain points of view could have been hashed out if, there were supplication of how a scene came into what is being told now. It was slow for me too, the pacing took its time.I am okay with love triangles now, but at the moment I feel like a turtle going back to my shell. I wasn’t a fan of it that much. It was done not for my liking. I don’t think I’d be the best market for that. Even with the other characters’ romance origin. It started really romantic. There is a slow burn present there. And the sweetest gestures that shows so much care. I am smirking as hell. The latter part of the execution was for me. There’s that.I love that body positivity the novel connotes during the pageant. It may appear as Dumplin’ contradicting that and may appear as hypocritical to some. However, I feel the complete opposite. I think it goes against the internalized misogyny in an individual of a minority too, to accept the thinking of just because a person is not fat or that an individual is seemingly fit, doesn’t mean that individual has no insecurities as well. I highly appreciate that scene. I want to go hug Willowdean and Ellen so tight.Speaking of Ellen, her best friend, the friendship in the book was another that screamed at me. There had been a rift. And during that rift, it was the most frustrating thing for me too, as a reader. She knows what to do yet she isn’t executing them. And then she met those drag queens without judgments, embracing them, earning new friends. Not with them but the newly formed camaraderie with the fellow contestants. The relationship with her Aunt was something I admire too. I felt that the crafting of that relationship was the only thing solid. I find my eyes getting moister by the second she mentions that she misses her too much.I also love that Willowdean hasn’t felt the way she should go on a strict diet and exercise to fit in with the pageant. She embraced herself and stun them with what she had learned from her newly found friends.Would I recommend it? Yes.Favorite Quotes“Maybe ’cause you don’t always have to win a pageant to wear a crown.”“Loyalty is…loyalty is being there for someone. It’s selfless.

I wasted all that time so you don't have to.” This book is a really cute, light read. But if you expect more, you'll be disappointed. It's a story of Willowdean ( Also called Dumplin' by her mother), who is fat but doesn't care of what other people think/talk about her body, and that's what I loved most in this book- her attitude towards people and how she never felt ashamed of her body. I really like the positive message the book is trying to give through our main character. Will's mom is a former beauty queen who always keep searching for some way to convince her to get in shape. But Will isn't bothered by any of this, the actually trouble starts when a boy enters in the picture. She's always conscious about her body when Bo is around. Which leads to misunderstandings, fights, drama, and....you know how it goes. And as much as I wanted to love this whole love angle, I didn't feel anything towards any of the characters. This book is very positive and gives a great message, but the characters seemed very dull. I couldn't connect of any of them so this whole story was just an okay read for me because there was no excitement or anything. Overall it's a really good story for all the girls who feel uncomfortable with their body/looks, and even for others! It's a light and quick read, but nothing memorable. ",en

441,18304322,2105363067,liked it,"Perfection is nothing more than a phantom shadow we’re all chasing.3.5 STARS Look out for minor spoilers ahead. The way I see it, we're all insecure about something. All of us. Whether you're insecure about your weight, your eyes, the way hands look in photographs, or simply the length of your eyelashes - there are physical features in all of us, that we can't help feeling anxious about. And, it doesn't even have to be physical. We can be insecure about our voice, people's perception of us, shyness or dancing in a loud room full of music. This book had a delightful message, full of body positivity. People should simply love their bodies. Full stop. No insecurities. But then again, if humans were perfect, life would be boring. People should feel comfortable in their bodies, as long as they're healthy (and if they're not, they have the freedom to slowly, and carefully, and healthily, work towards a healthier self - but not through the pressure of others; only through the importance of maintaining their health). We should all be grateful and happy with our bodies. But, let's be real. None of us look in the mirror, and think to ourselves 'wow, I look good'. Or at least I, certainly, don't. Dumplin' serves a moving and inspirational portion of body positivity, and loving yourself despite judgement faced by the world, not only from people around you, but also from yourself. It's one of those books that just sound like: 'What's stopping you? Go for it'. As the saying goes, your biggest enemy is your reflection in the mirror. What I liked: ?? - The message the author is trying to share. Now, I've heard people claiming this book is hypocritical and although it seems like it's promoting body positivity on the surface, beneath it all, there's no message. Now, I won't necessarily disagree with that, because unfortunately Willowdean was a pain in the neck sometimes and her actions often contradicted her morals - but, think about it form perspective: this book IS about body positivity. The author wanted to inspire and give courage to her readers - acting as an encouragement to simply live their life without boundaries and love who they are. Books with the aim to spread love for oneself, are very important. ?? - The 'small town' vibe. I am a huge admirer of atmosphere, therefore the fact that this book was set in a small town in Texas was an immediate plus. I really like the show 'Friday Night Lights', and thinking about it now, the setting of this book was remotely similar to Dillon.?? - There is a lot of focus on friendships. Now, that is something, that I always, always appreciate in a good book. Millie, Amanda, Hannah and Willowdean's friendship was pure gold - and although, I, at one point, wondered if Willowdean's intentions were as pure as the friendship itself, it was still a great aspect of the book. And, I loved all the girls - even Hannah, although, let's face it, she wasn't always a ray of sunshine. I liked Ellen and Willowdean's friendship as well. It was not perfect, in any way, and the author very realistically described one of the 'perks' of growing up, through showing how the two girls began growing apart from one another. Having been someone, who has gone through something along those lines of a fading friendship', I can say, that I appreciated that it was touched on in this novel. ?? - Bo, Mitch and Tim were lovely. They were all great guys, and I enjoyed reading about them, whether they were mentioned a lot or not. Mitch and Bo, in my opinion, were both treated awfully by Willowdean - but more on that later. ?? - There was a lot of focus on grief after losing somebody you loved.?? - The whole premise of the book. More significantly, I thought the idea of including a beauty pageant in a book was extremely refreshing, and enjoyable to read about. ?? - Willowdean's part time job in Harpy's and Chilli Bowl was a small, but a great addition to the storyline. I just love little details like that in books. What I didn't like: ? - WILLOWDEAN! Willowdean, Willowdean... and oh, did I mention... WILLOWDEAN? She was just a mess. Now, I understand that nobody is perfect as a teenager. Scratch that. Nobody is perfect at any age. But, as a teenager, you're kinda excused to dumb behavior, because when else to make mistakes than you're young and learning? I get that. I really do. I'm a teenager myself - I make mistakes on a daily basis. But, this kind of crossed the line. Willowdean does have a few good qualities (good leadership skills, could be nice when she wanted to, a good listener, stood up for herself and others) but unfortunately, they need a little tweaking, to come anywhere near the number of disappointing actions she does. She had a very frustrating personality, and needless to say, she was a hypocrite. Somewhere in the book, she says something really worth hearing, about learning not to judge other people's bodies. Lovely, splendid. Unfortunately, throughout the entire book, she continues judging people. From Bekah, to Millie, to the judges, and what not. It was really disheartening to watch her actions crumble beneath her words. ? - The love triangle was unnecessary. Completely uncalled for and did the storyline absolutely no justice. I have no idea what the point of adding two boys into the picture was? Literally, enlighten me. Not to mention, her treatment of both Bo and Mitch was truly awful. She led them both on, got mad at Bo for quite literally nothing, and treated Mitch like trash, leading him on... no more spoilers, but this really was a huge downfall. Both of the boys were great, and did not deserve to get such negligent treatment. I understand some reason behind her later treatment of one of the two, but if her love for him was as strong as she constantly either claimed it was, she would have managed to overcome her fear in order to be with the person she loved most. The love triangle was, to put, plainly 'stupid' and made me feel extremely bad for the guy who didn't get chosen, and who she used for her own enjoyment. ? - The knots weren't properly tied up. There, were so many questions left unanswered...SPOILERS AHEAD. SPOILERS. SPOILERS.Some questions on my mind:•WHO WON THE DAMN BEAUTY PAGEANT? I'm interested, people. I read this book for a reason, and although it's not on the top of my concerns, doesn't the person who won the beauty pageant, deserve a little credit? I guess not, because since it's not Willowdean, it doesn't matter. Ugh. •WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO MITCH? Is she just going to act like nothing ever happened, and ignore him. Like... what? They could at least be friends, and show a little decency, to the whole situation. Literally, all Willowdean said after she got caught was 'Sorry' and something along the lines of her not wanting to hurt him. Like, he was always so kind and caring towards her? How could you treat someone like that? Willowdean. Willowdean... you annoy me so. so. much. •WHAT DOES THE MUM ACTUALLY FEEL TOWARDS LUCY AND WILLOW-DEAN? Could the questions regarding their family bond be ANSWERED??•WHAT HAPPENED TO BEKAH AND BO? Think about it... Bo told Willowdean that he'd 'break up' with Bekah. So, first if he did do that, why is Bekah suddenly acting so kind towards Willowdean and offers her vasoline during the final? And, if not, why is Bo playing with her feelings? That feels a little out of chatacters for him. There's a few more that I can't think of at the moment, and whilst I thoroughly acknowledge that books aren't always meant to have a clear ending, I felt like it just could have been a lot better had there been a little more explanation.? - Once again, Willowdean's selfishness... Although, she claims, multiple times that she's happy with her body (although, she often feels a little insecure), she behaves extremely arrogantly towards people, using her weight as a way to slam guilt into other people. She used her weight as an excuse to insult Ellen and evoke the feeling of guilt inside her, when they simply had an argument, like most friends. So, since she feels comfortable inside her body, she can use her weight against others? It was ridiculous and infuriating. This was a very enjoyable, fast paced, and light read - and it was a relief after reading slightly 'heavier' books. Although I felt like throwing this book against this book against a brick wall and I caught myself often sighing from annoyance - I do think that books that evoke such strong emotion even if it is negative, deserve a little recognition and recommendation. I don't know if Willowdean was made such an unlikeable character on purpose, but it surely did give me an excuse to be angry with her. It made me mad and irritated, but it was also, like I mentioned above, truly enjoyable and it was one of those 'likeable books',>if that makes any sense to you. Overall, I'd give this one a go, if you're looking for a light hearted, entertaining contemporary, but try not to destruct anything while you're at it. This book is not to blame for any broken windows or walls.",en
442,18304322,2045876893,it was ok,"I'm confused. What was the point of this book?? I thought we were going to see some A+++ body positivity and some really tight, feel good validation about how weight doesn't define us. But instead I got... this?? Did whoever wrote the blurb actually read the book?? Because Dumplin' is less about one girl's good fight against society's obsession with skinny and more about one girl's fight for angst and love triangles. I've been reading a lot of contemporary recently. Don't ask, I'm just in that vibe. And honestly? Dumplin' is so average it kills me. I am dead. It was completely not what I expected it to be. For example, I didn't expect to dislike the narrator, Willowdean. Sure, she's got a kick-ass name, but what else? Nothing. She's a self proclaimed fat girl with a giant chip on her shoulder. I thought she would be sticking up for all the people out there who feel uncomfortable with their bodies. Nope: I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zippers in her size. Her eyes are too close together and her nose pinches up at the end. She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way.Is this supposed to be funny? Because it's not. It's mean. Millie is fucking rad, she should have been the heroine. She owns who she is, she's brave and sweet and kind. And in contrast, Will is a bit of a bitch. No-one escapes her judgement: Millie and Amanda together are basically one giant moving target that says MAKE FUN OF US.Amanda’s legs are uneven, so she wears these thick corrective shoes that make her look like Frankenstein.What the fuck, Willowdean?? And when she's not poking fun at the ""less attractive girls"" she's ripping at the skinny girls too. It's relentless. I hate the way she only befriends Millie and Amanda after she falls out with her best friend, Ellen. I don't know. The whole book was sort of uncomfortable in the way that Will treats others. She uses Mitch and leads him on and it's just cruel. She's mean about her mother's passion for pageant. She dicks her boss about -- DOES SHE WORK AT HARPY'S OR NOT?? MAKE UP YOUR MIND WILL! I feel like some of the descriptions of Will's insecurity were accurate and relatable, and I liked the way that grief was portrayed sensitively and realistically. But a lot of the good stuff was eclipsed by the shit. The whole pageant scenario was a mess beginning with the way that Will treats Ellen after she decides to enter too:“Have you thought about the fact that I feel as out of place here as you do?”“You have to back out. El, for me, you’ve got to. Let me have this one thing.”“What? Let you have what? You can’t pick and choose who joins the revolution.” She makes air quotes as she says “revolution.”I hear the logic in her voice. I recognize the truth there. But if El entered, she could really win. And that’s why she could ruin this.Wait, what? She's such a fucking bitch over the whole thing. See I thought the book was going to preach inclusivity, like: But no. She makes the whole pageant thing an ""us against them"" scenario. And I'm not here for it. Yes, we should be ensuring that people of all body types are respected and heard. But that means all body types. Not just Willowdean and her one woman crusade against everyone who's not her. Aside from this clusterfuck of a message, we just got pages and pages of Willowdean sulking. Yeah, PAGES AND PAGES. Because on top of all the judgmental bullshit, the love triangle (which is so devoid of chemistry it's not even worth mentioning) and the endless self centred angsting, this book is boring as all hell. Dumplin' was disappointing. This is 100% not a story about a girl who stands up for those who have spent their lives ashamed about not matching up to society's ideals which is what I thought I was getting. Never mind. I'll keep looking. ",en
443,18304322,699742773,really liked it,"Dumplin' is a very personal book to me because it hit every insecurity that I have about my body. I don't normally tear up while I'm reading a book, but this book made me want to sob into a pillow, but at the same time, it gave me so much hope and there is so much to love about the book.I've struggled with the way my body looks for years, past my teenage years and still into adulthood. I've always been on the plus side of the weight scale. I can't remember a time when I wasn't fat. It wasn't the easiest growing up being the biggest person in kindergarten and eventually high school. I wasn't bullied per se, but hurtful comments were made about the way I looked, frequently by people who were close to me. I felt ugly. I felt repulsive. At one point, even looking at myself in reflections made my skin crawl and filled me with so much self-loathing. And I felt lonely because no one understood me. I had no one to talk to about what it was like being a fat person. I wish it were different, but people judge you when they see you're a heavy person. For me, going to a restaurant for dinner was uncomfortable because I was scared I would be judged for eating. I hated going shopping because I was worried I would never find nice clothes that would fit me. I hated being seen in public with my thin friends because I was worried that I would look ugly next to them. Over the years, I started to shed my insecurities on the exterior, but deep down, I still had them. I still get pangs in my chest when someone mentions how ""big"" I've gotten over the past year or one of the most hurtful comments I've gotten ""No one is going to want to be with you because of how fat you are."" I know that sometimes these comments come because people care for you, but that doesn't make it any easier.You may be wondering why I'm sharing my life-story with you in this review. That's because I wish that I had a character like Dumplin's protagonist, Willowdean, to look up to when I was younger, to give me confidence and hope that I don't have to let the way that I look rule my life. Willowdean was empowering in every way. She was comfortable in her own skin, funny, feisty and wasn't afraid to shut down others when they made fun of her or the other girls in the book. She wasn't all perfect though. She had the tendency to be selfish at times and I thought it was realistic. Watching as the insecurities seeped into her when she entered the pageant and when she was with her love interest, Bo, was painful and I wanted to give the girl a hug. I relived every sucky body-image related moment in my life while reading Dumplin'. It's safe to say, Julie Murphy captured that voice in an authentic way.Besides being body-positive, Dumplin' was also very female-friendship oriented. Willow made some awesome new friends and I loved watching these girls bond. They were funny and loyal, and friends that every girl should have. The romance between Willowdean and her co-worker, Bo, was sweet and while it was filled with obstacles, it worked for me. Bo was wonderful and I had nothing but love for this boy. There were some minor things that I could have personally done without in Dumplin' such as the way Willowdean treated a boy who had a crush on her but who she only saw as a friend and the mean girl story with her best friend Ellen's co-worker, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.Ultimately, Dumplin' is a great book because it teaches readers such an important life lesson: be confident with who you are and don't let prejudices and stereotypes ruin your life. Like Willow would say, ""If you got it, flaunt it!"".",en

This in no way impacted on my view.This book has been out in America since September, and as soon as the reviews started streaming in, I knew it was a book for me. When I received the email from Harper360 about the UK release of the book in February, I immediately jumped at the chance to read it. The day the book arrived was a Saturday (the one before Christmas, actually, and my first home from uni), and because of building work on our house, I'd had to be out the house since 8am til about 2pm. Coming home to fabulous book post, just made everything so much better, and I started the book right that second!In Dumplin', the MC, Willowdean, is a self-professed fat girl, and she has no shame in it. Just because she's a bit larger than other people, doesn't mean she should be ashamed of herself. However, her mother, a former pageant queen, feels like her ""Dumplin'"" could always lose a few pounds, and has had her on different diets since she was in third grade, I believe. After her aunt Lucy died, due to a heart attack cause by obesity, Will's weight becomes more of an issue, and she also has other problems to contend with. A hot guy at work is showing real interest in her, and she is having issues with her best friend. To top it all off, she decides to enter the legendary Miss Clover City beauty pageant, along with a few of her 'misfit' friends.Now, isn't third grade when you're 8-9? Being English I don't really understand the whole American grading system, but I do know that the kids in third grade are still really young. To have one on yo-yo dieting is honestly disgusting, and kinda made me hate her mam, to be honest. I love Willowdean for being so happy in herself. Yes, she knew she was big, and yeah, she could lose a few pounds, but why should she? She's confident, and happy; she has friends, and doesn't need to be stick thin for any of these. Most books you read about 'bigger' girls these days end up with them having a full makeover: weight loss, hair, make-up, the whole works, and I think that is damaging for modern teenagers to read. Don't we have enough problems seeing borderline anorexic models and Photoshop actresses in magazines, adverts, movies, etc.? Not everyone looks like that, and to make that seem like the 'normal', 'proper' way to be, it's no wonder so many teenagers have body and self esteem issues.The 'misfit' group of characters, aren't really misfits - they're just normal people, who aren't perfect. And how refreshing is that? And they weren't all to be pitied - they were feisty, and strong, and just a tad bitchy. They were normal teenage girls, and not the perfect, all-American teenager we see so much of. I liked them all, and was glad that there was tension between Will and best friend, Ell, so that she could get out of her comfort zone, and make new friends.The romance, I wasn't too much of a fan of. Bo, for me, wasn't who I'd have picked for Will. There was just a slight edge to him, and I cared more about the friendship sections of the book, than the romance - quite a surprise for me. Mitch was a much better guy, in my opinion, though I understood that the connection just wasn't there for Will to chose him. That being said, I didn't feel like it was a full on love triangle, just that there were two guys who liked Will, but none of the regular angst you see when that occurs.As I've said, I really disliked Willowdean's mam. However, I felt like that whole story arc came full circle, and was pleased with how their relationship was left at the end of the book. Since finishing Dumplin', I've found out that Julie will be writing a companion novel, due tentatively for 2018, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of Will and her mam. I hope the companion is from Millie's PoV, or even Amanda's.Oh yeah, and Dolly Parton was a huge part in the novel - who doesn't love a bit of Dolly?!This is a book that teenage Sophie would've adored, and 20 year old Sophie does just the same. The only real issue I had was that it ended so abruptly - like so many contemporaries do :( - but now I know there will be a companion/sequel, I'm so much happier! Everyone should read this book: young and old, thin and fat, you name it. I wasn't expecting this review to be so long, but I just have a lot of feelings, okay?

449,18304322,2619036554,it was ok,"This book never really appealed to me based on the reviews I've seen, but I can't find it in myself to watch an adaptation without at least trying the book first, so I figured I would give it a chance.My consensus? It wasn't the worst thing I've ever read, but it needed a lot of work in a lot of areas.The story follows self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson as she enters her mother's famous pageant along with the other town outcasts and tries to juggle her first romantic relationships.As far as the two things I liked in this one? The Dolly obsession and Mitch. As a person who attaches a lot of my identity to my music, even as someone who doesn't listen to Dolly, I know how it feels to be empowered by certain artists. Mitch was just a cutie pie. His character addressed some toxic masculinity stuff, and the way he treated Willowdean was so respectful and sweet. Honestly, he deserved better than how she treated him.assorted things that didn't work for me in Dumplin':- there's no plot. I've liked my share of meandering contemporaries, but this book lacked focus and didn't have characters compelling enough to make up for it.- there's no sense of tone. oftentimes I felt myself confused at what scenes were supposed to make me feel, as the majority of the time I just felt indifferent, as there was nothing that really made the story or writing stand out to me.- the pacing is meh at best. the pageant takes a long time to come into play and I even considered one starring at the beginning simply because of how bored I was.- the romances were bland and inoffensive, but for being such a major part of the story, I felt nothing when reading the scenes between Willowdean and Bo. There really didn't need to be a love triangle either.- though she does incur some growth, Willowdean is a pretty awful person for the majority of the story. she treats her friends, her mom, and her romantic interests like absolute trash. Mitch calls her terrifying, she puts down her skinny friend for wanting to enter the pageant, and she basically tells her mom that her aunt was a better mother figure than she could ever hope to be. this is all supposed to support that Will has a 'take no shit' attitude, but she just came off as a complete brat for the majority of the book. a flawed main character can be great (A Very Large Expanse of Sea is a great example of how to write an angry, defensive main character), but your MC can't lose all sympathy in the process.Overall, I didn't have super strong feelings towards this one, but I don't regret my time reading it. Now off to watch the movie and maybe listen to a little Dolly...Movie Thoughts: My gosh, that was one of the most wholesome, lovely films I've seen in a long time. Netflix knows their shit when it comes to YA adaptations and I can only hope they continue to bless us readers like this. Not only is this adaptation faithful to the book's message and themes, it's different enough to be its own thing and improves upon a lot of the book's tone, pacing and characterization issues. The film is truly the iteration this story was meant to be told in.",en

I just have a love hate relationship with it. It wasn't terrible. But it wasn't the best thing I have ever read. Go to the bottom to see the rude quotes. Overall story: This story... Where do I begin? I had such high hopes for such a hyped body positive book. However, within the first 50 pages the main protagonist begins to shame others! If your having problems yourself don't shame others because you feel bad about yourself. I was just shocked that of all people the main character was shaming others... Characters: Will: Guys. Will is a whole mess. Our main protagonist was one of my least favorite characters. She's rude, judges others, and worst of all plays the victim in almost every situation. However, I did like how she gained confidence in herself throughout the whole book. You could totally see a confidence change. Bo: Wow. What a terrible love interest. This love interest is one of the worst I have read in a book before. NO I DONT SHIP! Throughout the book I just felt like he was using Will. El: I don't like the friend either. I KNOW I'M SORRY. She's just as mean to Will as Will was to her. She treated her like a spare tire. Which was crappy. Callie: I think this was suppose to be the mean girl. She sucked. She did her job because I hated her all the way through the book. Hannah: The only character I loved. Hannah was relatable and such a cute character to read about. First off, Will talked about her teeth all the time. Why the heck do you care do much? Overall Hannah was pretty cool.The Mom: Unsupportive and crappy. She was just rude! She made up for it a centimeter at the end. Lovey Dovey: The love thing was so cringe. It was all so forced and awkward. The ending didn't do it for me. Sorry. The next thing is she didn't want anyone to know they were in a relationship because basically she felt sorry for herself?! But yet at the beginning she wanted it to be not secret? I am confusion. EXPLAIN WILL! Ending: Wow that was disappointing. The ending had me half full. I really needed more. We didn't even get to see who won? We saw who was runner up and that was about it. So many things were left unexplained. Cons:(start with the bad...)I feel terrible rating this book so low. However, Will was really unlikeable. She shamed other women. Who were suppose to be her friends. “All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on.” Like oh super cool! Read below... My Scientific Opinion: This place is a shithole and all the girls who work here are vapid skanks who treat me like El’s charity case friend. Take your own advice Will! I need a book with more positivity. Pros:(end on a good note:) I actually liked the laughs that were put in. The girls going to the drag show were hilarious. (And Hannah) ",en

 “Perfection is nothing more than a phantom shadow we’re all chasing” 
 I honestly don’t know why I waited so long to read this! With the movie coming out I decided it might be time to give it a shot and it didn’t disappoint. I loved how it embraced self worth and esteem. There were so many little nuggets of wisdom throughout this book.   “I've wasted a lot of time in my life. I've thought too much about what people will say or what they're gonna think. And sometimes it's over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn't good enough. But you don't have to bother with that nonsense. I wasted all that time so you don't have to.”  Willow Dean the MC was great. I gotta say in the beginning and for a lot of the book she was upset about people being judgmental but yet... she was kind of like the people she despised. She had lessons to learn and I think by the end, (without spoiling anything) I think she learned a good bit. These days there is so much pressure on Women AND Men to be a certain size, look a certain way, be like this one or that one, that it’s just to the point where people have a hard time just being themselves. That’s what this book was about for me. Shinning the light on ourselves and looking at the inside and not the outside. I read this in one sitting- it was written so “easy breezy” that it was extremely hard to put down. I am so looking forward to the movie now!",en

It was the attitude that came with knowing how ridiculous people thought she looked, but never changing a thing because she felt good about herself.
Changing the rating to one star, because I cannot, for the life of me, remember anything about the good parts in this book. Just the fact that I felt sick all throughout reading it. I’m a fat girl. I, more than anyone, wished to see in this book what I would have needed in the early stages on my own teenage years. And yet, this book fell flat. It’s a disappointment. Dumplin’ tells the story of Willowdean, a young fat girl living in a small town in Texas, as she learns to navigate her life after an important loss. She works, sighs a lot even when she’s not really supposed to and leads a pretty normal high school life. That’s it, until a decision will turn her into one of the unlikely candidates for a beauty pageant. I dislike a lot the way in which this book has been promoted as this new perfect book, with tons of self-confidence and nice messages regarding body positivity. That’s what I was expecting as well: a main character that feels good in her skin and is not afraid to let others know it too. Instead, our Willowdean is an insecure mess for most of the book, and lots of her thoughts processes were just sad and depressing. It mirrored so much of my own thoughts from when I had a low self-confidence that sometimes it was hard to breathe. I wouldn’t have minded so much if it was not meant to be this revolutionary contemporary on such topics. But I came here for feel good things, and I was not given that. 
The word fat makes people uncomfortable. But when you see me, the first thing you notice is my body. And my body is fat. It’s like how I notice some girls have big boobs or shiny hair or knobby knees. Those things are okay to say. But the word fat, the one that best describes me, makes lips frown and cheeks lose their colour. 
Plus, Willowdean is just an over-all very unlikeable character. I know at fault is probably the first person’s narrative (which is never a plus in my view), but she felt very detached from the story and I felt more real the voices of the secondary characters. She is indecisive and moody, refuses communication when is actually tried and she’s a hypocrite who judges EVERYONE around her. She skinny shames other girls, shits on girls in her situation and has a comment at ready about anyone she meets. It’s horrible and makes all her actual positive words fade and turn into just big nothings. The only way in which this book directly shows a decisive stand on the issue of fat persons is Willowdean calling out her mom for the suggestions regarding her body. But again, even that is over-shadowed over and over again by Will’s own, identical judgements passed on other fat girls. However, I do appreciate that the ingrained reactions to fatness have been discussed and that bullying against fat people has been tackled. There has been a passage where the PMS excuse was called out, and that was beautiful as well. I can see that this book tried to weave through these issues and bring forth a piece that should have made you think, but it kind of failed. 
Have you ever walked into a building that is dedicated to being everything you’re not? I want to be healthy, but I also want to be happy.
But the secondary characters are beautiful!! I swear I enjoyed each and every one of them; even when it felt like little to no effort was put into building their character, they all felt very real and lovely and I enjoyed finding out about them a lot. The setting has been well-built as well: it felt suffocating at time and very sad, just like a small town that no one has ever heard of should be. Of course, though, because I am me: I disliked the love triangle. Despite being dealt with fairly soon (it certainly doesn’t go on for tens of pages like in other novels of the genre), I still don’t think it was something necessary in this book and neither did it brought something new and meaningful to the story. For me, it just kindled my disinterest and dislike towards Willowdean. 
I think you gotta be who you want to be until you feel like you are whoever it is you’re trying to become. Sometimes half of doing something is pretending that you can.
The narrative style was okay most of the times, but nothing out of the ordinary. Just the fresh, simple style I was expecting from a book such as this. I’m neither a fan of Julie Murphy’s writing, but not a hater either. There were these instances when “quotable lines” were thrown into a very normal (and sometimes boring) dialogue just to give it off a more interesting/philosophical feel; and I usually fall for these kinds of things. But in this case it felt fake enough to have even me pick up on it. The ending also fell flat. The story built up to the pageant, but all was dealt very fast and somewhat superficially, when the time finally came for Will’s “moment of fame.” There was no actual explanation about it, and neither at the end of it. It ended too abruptly after all the slow scenes that were before it and it was just another disappointment and detail that left me sour. Still, this book is important simply for having a fat character as the main character, which is still a rare sight in YA (and literature in general) and I will appreciate it for it. I enjoyed it enough to reach the end, obviously. But there are too many details I just can’t get over. 
I wish I would’ve had friends that were going after things they weren’t supposed to have. I was so scared of myself at that age. I was so scared that all the big things I wanted would never be anything more than wants.

Good friendships are durable. They’re meant to survive the gaps and the growing pains.

Clearly, I'm going to use ""adorable"" a lot to sum this book up. But it is. That's the bottom line.Will has all kinds of stuff going on in this book, certainly way more than just being overweight. Her mom is like, Queen of the Pageant, and in Texas, that is apparently a big deal. Her aunt, who was basically her support system, died at a young age not long ago from weight-related complications. Her best friend is kind of acting shady, and she's got a big old crush on Bo, the dude who works with her.So you know, let's join said beauty pageant with as many other ""pageant atypical"" females you can gather! It's fun, and charming, and for other characters it probably wouldn't work so well, but with Will, it just made sense. It fit her personality, and I loved that she started kind of a mini-movement.There were two parts of this book that stood out the most to me: The overwhelming charm, and the relationships. I don't mean the romantic ones (though they do stand out!) but all of them: Willow's tumultuous relationship with her mom, her evolving friendships, and most importantly, the relationship she has with herself. Will basically never realized that she even did feel insecure in her own skin. She didn't give it much thought at all, until Bo showed reciprocal interest. And of course, as one does, he wants to touch her. She feels repulsed by the mere thought of someone feeling her heft, and in that moment, she becomes so, so human. So relatable. I wanted to hug her and then cry with her, because it's such an awful, yet such a real feeling.The gist of the book is Will navigating life. Not just ""life as a fat girl"", but life in general. She struggles with things that are specific to her, and things that pretty much everyone goes through. Will's personality is larger than her body, and she just shines. She makes mistakes, she gets back up, and she learns to live her life.
Bottom Line:
 This is such a lovely coming of age book that I dare say everyone can relate to. Thin, heavy, or anywhere in between, Will has to go through the same ups and downs we all face, and learns so much about herself and everyone around her along the way.*Copy provided from publisher for review.",en

465,18304322,2080708263,it was ok,"I bought this as a Kindle read because I kept seeing such high ratings for it and then learned that it is or was a #1 NYT bestseller and is being made into a movie. This intrigued me because it looks like a very lightweight YA book; and so it is. I got bored by chapter 26 (which is forty percent through, according to my Kindle) but also irritated. The author seems to be so focused on MAKING A POINT about fat acceptance that, firstly, she writes an ongoing and blindingly obvious hypocrisy into the book. The female protagonist is supposedly lovable and gorgeous, despite her excess weight (and dammit, don't you dare say otherwise) but her boyfriend is of course the hot-jock football player that all the girls pant after, up to and including whistling at him in class and drooling together over his tight bum, in public places. Because it's fine to objectify boys so long as you don't do it to girls, which would make you a sexist pig. Also, fat girls are beautiful and should feel great about themselves, but fat boys are unappealing apparently. You can't have them as the hero of the story, right? For our girl, only the best will do and by ""best"" we mean hottest jock ever seen in a pair of swim trunks.Secondly, there is no mention of Dumplin's (AKA Willowdean's) father so far in this book, which is chapter 26. This is weird. She is growing up with her mom and, until last year, her aunt Lucy who lived with them, but who has died young from obesity-related health complications when the book opens. It's of course fine to grow up in such a household and that is not my complaint. What's not fine is that the author apparently believes that the whole story of the father can be written off like this by his daughter: ""A single parent home is all I've ever known, and Lucy more than made up for some deadbeat dad. My real dad was some guy passing through town. He stuck around for awhile, but not long enough to be more than some guy. He's in Ohio or Idaho. Wherever the potatoes come from,"" (p.216). I had to do a search of the book to find that isolated mention of her father.Because children from single-parent households are glib and breezy about never having contact with the missing parent, and they don't feel neglected or abandoned or have anger, distress, self-esteem problems related to that? Wrong. They most certainly do, always, inevitably. Not to say they can't get through it; they can and do. But to pretend it's not at all a problem because an aunt who loves you will totally make up for any questions or feelings you might otherwise have about your dad not caring you exist? That's idiotic, sorry. Also, the fact that there are no positive and loving and close male role models for Dumplin would absolutely affect her ability to know how to relate comfortably and well to boys and men. Again, this is something she could work through, but the kind of conversations she carries off so intelligently and thoughtfully with Bo, once he begins to loosen up himself, are unbelievable to me. The insecurities she mulls over regarding Bo are about how her body fat will feel when he touches her. She worries about that and feels scared to reveal her body to a boy sexually. But apparently she is totally cool on how to socially relate to males, on a one-to-one basis, because Aunt Lucy and Dolly Parton exist. Right, that makes total sense in some universe. What I am saying is that this book has some glaring problems that got in the way of my enjoying it, but I don't believe they are oversights. I believe the author made her choices specifically either because they reflect her own principles or because they are so highly marketable right now. The current zeitgeist is that fat girls are ""real women"" (so thin ones are airbrushed and unreal, apparently). Also, women rearing children on their own, or with other women, whose children never know their biological fathers, causes no confusion or upset at all for the children, nor do the children have problems relating to males when they start dating them. Before I get tomatoes thrown at me, I want to state that I am firmly PRO gay relationships and marriage and adoption and equal rights. That is not my point here. My point is that children do have a natural curiosity about their fathers and mothers, whenever one parent is missing from their lives. It is a pain they feel acutely and it has to be noticed, discussed, and worked through with the child's best interest at heart. If you are writing about a child who has had this missing parent scenario, you need to do a lot better than brush it off by saying an auntie took the place of dad. That's bollocks. I could give more examples of the authors' blatant trumpeting of particular social mores that happen to be on trend at present, over others which are truer but unfashionable, but you can find them for yourself if you care to read this book. As for me, I've wasted enough time and money on it. ",en

If you're going to write how 16 and 17-year-olds talk, you need to listen to them talk, REALLY listen to them talk, for hours and days and weeks and possibly years and then depict them in an authentic way.

She's a pain, to be sure, and way too critical of her single mom, but she's a well-written, full-bodied character (pun intended), and it's obvious that the author loves her and wants you to love her more.My favorite lines from Dumplin':All my life I've had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it's that if it's not your body, it's not yours to comment on.

It’s not that it’s sad – it’s that it’s relateable, and the issues that Willowdean was facing were ones I faced as a teen, especially with her mother, her friends, and feeling good enough to be with a guy.Let me explain: When I was eight, my mom showed me an article in the newspaper that showed Princess Diana and how she wore a lot of pink and purple, and told me that those were the colours I should wear if I wanted to be more feminine. When I was 12, she got permanent eyeliner and brow liner tattooed on, and suggested that I might want to do this sometime when I was an adult. When I was 13, she told me that it was important that I became a “life-long weight watcher.” And throughout my high school and college years, she would often comment on how, if I just made an effort, I could be prettier, more popular, and thinner (I was wearing the big, baggy t-shirts, comfy jeans, Doc Martens of the grunge era) – and that would make me happier.Contrary to the synopsis, Dumplin isn’t just about a pageant or a boy – it’s about a girl who isn’t afraid to say she’s fat, who both judges herself while standing up for herself, and who is dealing with the death of her beloved aunt, who died of a heart attack and was on disability because of her extreme obesity. It’s about not having a ton of money, and needing to work to get out of your small town or get your car fixed, all while your entire town is obsessed with a beauty pageant.All of these pieces make Willowdean question herself and her own choices. So when Willowdean gets the guy of her dreams, she just can’t let herself be okay with it because she’s not okay with herself. And to add insult to injury, she and her (very thin and beautiful) best friend are slowly growing apart because of love, jealousy, and hurt. In short, this is a book about everything you feel about growing up. And it’s funny, sarcastic, and swoony, too.What Dumplin really gets right is theme: every moment of this book, whether it’s advancing the romantic plot or friendship plot, or just Willowdean’s own development – it’s all in line with the themes of loving yourself and how difficult and important that can be sometimes.And yet, the plot does not dwell on those themes – this is not a book about how to deal with being fat or your body issues. It’s about a girl who is just…living her life. Murphy infuses Willowdean’s voice with so much honesty and rawness that I was left crying a multiple points because of how REAL it all felt to me. These were the thoughts I had in high school, especially about boys and friendship, and these were the moments I had with my mother over my own appearance.While there are some beautiful gems of moments in this book where I swooned and sighed, Dumplin was so delicately and thoughtfully written that the whole thing felt like a moment. I dogeared dozens of pages and nodded to myself so many times. It’s a book I know I’ll read again to learn from and feel those magic moments of rightness. Words to Live By: “All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything, it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on. Fat. Skinny. Short. Tall. It doesn’t matter.”‘”I thought about it. I think every girl in this town does. But I wasn’t the same person I am today. I didn’t have it in me back then to pretend I felt good enough about myself to enter a beauty pageant.”Her words sink in. I wonder if that’s why the pageant has bothered me more this year than in the past. The girls who enter have got to be proud enough of themselves to say they deserve to compete. That kind of unflinching confidence makes me uneasy in a way it never has before.”‘‘”Wait. What’s my strength?” I ask.She smiles. “Your confidence, of course.”I zone out completely. How can she see something I can’t feel? And what’s the point in acting confident if I’m not? I never thought I cared about what I saw in the mirror. But Bo ruined that. It’s supposed to be easier to like yourself when someone else likes you.But that can’t be true. No matter how much I tell myself that the fat and the stretch marks don’t matter, they do. Even if Bo, for whatever reason, doesn’t care, I do.Then there are days when I really give zero flying fucks, and I am totally satisfied with this body of mine. How can I be both of those people at once?” Book Theme Song: 
Jolene by Dolly Parton
This is Willowdean's favourite song, and it's mentioned in the book more than once.Dolly Parton plays a really big and wonderful role in this book, so I HAD to choose it for the theme song.
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I’m begging of you please don’t take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don’t take him just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
 The Final Word: It took me years to deal with the self-esteem issues that I had from my teenage years. This book is both an embodiment of those issues and a way to understand and deal with them - and aside from that, it's also super emotional, sweet, funny, and swoony. I really believe this is a book that any teen who has ever thought a bad thought about their appearance will relate to, and it's definitely one that I'd recommend for health classes and to be put on any bookshelf from 7th grade onward.DUMPLIN’ comes out on September 15th. Have you read it? If not, will you be picking up a copy? Do you watch or have you been in any pageants? What do you think of them? ",en

Su tamaño es parte de ella, pero sabe que no es todo lo que importa. Ella tiene confianza (la mayor parte del tiempo) y es completamente dueña de su personalidad. Una de las cosas que más destacó para mí fue el grado de realismo es Willowdean.Esto no es sólo un libro para las chicas ""diferentes"", es para cualquiera que alguna vez se ha sentido incómoda en su propio cuerpo. Julie Murphy cuenta una historia realista y relevante. Dumplin te hará reír, sonreír, ilusionarte, y llorar. Es inspirador y agradable y estimulante. Dumplin es un libro que sé que voy a volver a leer una y otra. Se lo recomiendo a todo el mundo, sin importar su tamaño o el sexo o la edad o cualquier otra cosa.",es

471,18304322,1383418588,it was amazing,"I'm going to go all in on this one for two reasons:1. It was SLOWASFUCK at work today, so I was standing at an Auto parts counter reading this on my phone. And I got really into it, couldn't put it down!2. I can really see myself in Willowdean, so much that it hurt to read about her struggles at times.Guys, this book is so freaking real! I have read Julie Murphy's other book, and can't say I really cared for it all that much. Who knows, maybe I was just burned out on kids-with-cancer books (especially ones about teens, involving a romance/love triangle/heart eyes of some kind). Willowdean is a high-school junior who is fat. To her, this isn't even really a bad thing. It's just part of who she is. Yes, she has insecurities. Who doesn't when you don't fit the stick-thin Hollywood image of beauty and perfection? Story time...I went through years of hating my body, feeling awkward about myself, and justifying my appearance to the world around me. I was a skinnyass child, who got fat after puberty. It wasn't all at once either, I just gained about ten pounds every year in high school, until I was forty pounds overweight when it ended. But yeah, shopping for clothes was a nightmare, I always felt like everyone was staring at me (really, mostly at my fat ass) as I walked, and I never really believed my boyfriend when he said he loved me. How could he love me, when every time I looked in the mirror I didn't love myself?With a beauty pageant queen as a mother, Will is going through some of the same self-doubt. But she has her best friend Ellen, the fact that she's come to terms with herself, and the love/memories/shared Dolly Parton fandom of her Aunt Lucy (who died at almost 500lbs, of a heart attack) to support her. Until a situation with Bo, a hot boy she works with becomes something to make her doubt herself and what she deserves. They are make-out buddies, without a label, until the day she meets his stepmom and is denied as just a friend. Refusing to be the ""secret girlfriend"" Will breaks it off. Then, she finds a pageant entry form in her Lucy's things and decides to enter it -- because why the Hell shouldn't she??? Why doesn't she deserve everything the skinny, ""good-looking"" girls do? This inspires a chain-reaction and four other physical misfits enter the pageant to join the revolution. When another boy, Mitch, starts noticing Will and Bo starts trying to win her back, will she let her insecurities get the best of her? And can she make her mother proud of her, fat and all? Will she be proud of her mother and the way she handles the situation or will their relationship be destroyed beyond repair? And can Will and Ellen mend fences, after the fight to end all fights?The teenagers in this book talk and think like real people. Willowdean is a sassy, take-no-prisoners kinda girl and is basically spending the book trying to learn a simple lesson: Don't spend your life letting others dictate who you are, what you deserve and the chances you can take. Dare to dream and to put that dream into action. It's not even necessarily ""love yourself,"" it's more of ""don't let fear dictate."" I love Will's fellow misfits: bucktoothed Hannah (who is Dominican & a lesbian), morbidly obese Millie who is a secret pageant Queen at heart (and who has confidence in herself), and limping Amanda, who wears a leg brace and dreams of soccer. None of these girls are the pageant ideal, but they don't let that stop them one bit! Also, the Dolly Parton impersonating drag queens are awesome. There is sex in this book, but with real talk and NO SLUT SHAMING! Hard thing to find in YA nowadays. A sassy, teenage Southern fat-girl's beauty pageant experience. If you've ever felt less than you are, you will relate to this book. I wish it had been around, when I was less than loving myself as a teenager.

472,18304322,1726411462,really liked it,"Dumplin dus... in heel wat reviews hoor ik het woord ""grappig"" vallen. En dat is het ook, dat wil ik zeker niet ontkrachten. Maar als volslanke lezer was het ook met momenten gewoon pijnlijk confronterend. Laat ik maar meteen heel persoonlijk uit de hoek komen. Ik was net als het hoofdpersonage Will al op jonge leeftijd zwaar. Tijdens het lezen durfde 16 jarige Silke echt nog wel de kop op te steken en te gillen: ""He zo was ik ook."" Dus ja, best confronterend. Want die onzekerheid die je als tiener voelt, die sluimert voor altijd toch ergens in je hoofd. Ondertussen ben ik een 31 jarige vrouw met een overgewicht probleem, maar ook met een ontzettend gelukkig leven en heel wat zelfvertrouwen. En hoewel Willowdean een fictioneel personage is wou ik haar bij momenten in mijn armen sluiten en haar toevertrouwen dat het wel allemaal goedkomt en dat er momenten zijn dat je gewoon vrolijk door het leven huppelt en vergeet dat je een ""dikke dame"" bent.Deze lange aanloop om duidelijk te maken dat dit waarschijnlijk de meest persoonlijke review is die ik ooit heb geschreven en dat je mijn meningen en ervaringen ziet kleuren door eigen ervaringen.Dumplin is zonder twijfel een erg lichaamspositief boek, dat de harde waarheid toch niet uit de weg gaat. Willowdean, het hoofdpersonage straalt naar de buitenwereld heel wat zelfvertrouwen uit. Maar wij als lezer kunnen een kijkje nemen in haar hoofd en daar is ze lang niet zo zeker van zichzelf als ze laat uitschijnen. Will is niet altijd 100% zeker van zichzelf. Ze verbergt zich tijdens het zwemmen. Is bang om gepest te worden en vind zichzelf vaak te min. Zo gaat het, voor mij althans, ook in het echte leven. Ik herkende me zo in de attitude die Will heeft, maar die in haar hoofd toch helemaal anders loopt. En dat schrille contrast maakt dit boek net tot zo een ontzettende kanjer. Of je nu zelf zwaarlijvig bent of niet, iedereen heeft onzekerheden. Dus ga je altijd raakvlakken hebben met Will en alle andere tieners.Dumplin verheerlijkt zwaarlijvigheid niet en dat was voor mij erg belangrijk. Het zou makkelijk zijn om een boek te schrijven over een zwaarlijvig meisje dat perfect gelukkig is en de wereld eens zal laten zien wat ze waard is. Maar laten we eerlijk zijn, er zijn sowieso belemmeringen en zelf gevaren die obesitas met zich meebrengen. Het zou een gemiste kans geweest zijn als je alleen maar de ""hoera, dik zijn is oke"" weg had ingeslagen. Dit gebeurt niet. Er wordt meermaals aandacht gegeven aan hoe het ook slecht kan aflopen. Voor mij was de balans van ""iedereen is mooi zoals hij is"" en ""hou je ook rekening met de gevaren"" perfect. Daar verdient Julie Murphy echt punten voor!Naast overgewicht en alle gevolgen gaat dumplin natuurlijk over nog veel meer en ook dat maakt het verhaal zo sterk. De vriendschappen in dit boek zijn om van te smullen, net omdat ze zo realistisch zijn. Will en El, haar beste vriendin, groeien uit elkaar. Iets wat gebeurt wanneer je opgroeit. Ik vond de verhaallijn hierover erg sterk en goed uitgewerkt. Je zag de meisjes echt zoeken naar het hoe en waarom van hun vriendschap en ook vooral wie ze zijn zonder elkaar. En dan is er natuurlijk de romantiek. Want wat is een goed YA boek zonder een flinke portie romantiek? Niks toch.... en hemeltje de kus scenes in dit boek zijn om van te smullen. De twee potentiële liefdespartners zijn trouwens allebei hele sterke, maar tegelijkertijd heel verschillende personages. Ja, je leest het goed twee.... maar maak je geen zorgen. In dumplin is er geen spraken van een driehoeksverhouding of toch niet op een klassieke manier. Neen, net op een hele realistische, leerzame manier. Willowdean heeft heel wat over zichzelf te leren en dat doet ze ook met de hulp van beiden jongens.Nog een kleine waarschuwing voor je vol overgave in Dumplin duikt. Willowdean is niet het meest sympathieke personage in het YA genre. Ze maakt fouten en is niet altijd op haar best. Maar geef haar een kans. Ze is onzeker over het leven, zoals we dat allemaal waren toen we 16 jaar oud waren. Kijk even onder die beschermingslaag en je vind een hartverwarmend, ontzettend lief meisje!",nl
473,18304322,2456024660,it was ok,"Comecei a ler com toda a vontade e intenção de gostar desse livro. Não posso negar os pontos positivos da história então vou dividir o que funcionou ou não para mim em Dumplin':O que eu gostei:- Protagonista GORDA (não ""gordinha"" ou ""cheia"") e não é SÓ ela. O que mais vejo em livros com protagonistas gordas ou ~fora do padrão~ é esla ser a ÚNICA gorda no mundo inteiro, o que é completamente irreal.- Willowdean é confiante e segura de si ao mesmo tempo que tem inseguranças com seu corpo. Ninguém é 100% confiante ou insegura o tempo todo - nem precisa ser. Mostrar que é possível ter esse equilíbrio é extremamente importante para discutir body image e auto estima, na minha opinião.- Apesar do romance, o relacionamento de amizade entre a Willowdean e Ellen é uma grande parte de tudo. - Outras personagens ~fora do padrão~ e que também tem suas questões discutidas (muito por alto, mas é alguma coisa que espero ver com mais frequência)- Ouvi o audiobook e a narradora faz um sotaque sulista dos EUA que me diverte muitoO que não gostei:- A protagonista. Durante a leitura me forçava a lembrar toda hora que ela é 1) uma adolescente, 2) do interior do sul dos EUA, e 3) cheia de problemas como qualquer outra pessoa; apesar disso tudo não consegui gostar dela. Ela tem atitudes que ou não faziam sentido ou eram bem imaturas. A curva de desenvolvimento de uma personagem é algo que eu valorizo muito nos livros e aqui deixou um pouco a desejar.- Triângulo amoroso. Não dá, não consigo engolir triângulos amorosos, ainda mais como justificativa pra pessoa ser egoísta e imatura. Não sabe o que fazer sem prejudicar ninguém? NÃO FAZ NADA, até saber. ¯\_(?)_/¯ Ainda assim, não posso ignorar como é bom ver uma personagem gorda participando de um clichê que sempre foi reservado à personagens ""dentro do padrão"".- A amizade ser uma grande parte da história é ótimo, mas a dinâmica entre as duas não desceu pra mim. No geral, Willowdean parece ser uma amiga bem ruim, Ellen não consegue entender de onde vem as inseguranças e problemas da amiga - o que não é culpa dela, mas não foi algo que gostei na leitura.Eu realmente esperava mais, mas não posso negar a importância de um livro como Dumplin' ser publicado, adaptado para os cinemas e abrindo espaço para outras (e melhores) histórias com personagens gordas aparecerem.",pt
474,18304322,1527811164,liked it,"Dumplin' by Julie Murphy - 3 stars.I had high expectations for this book prior picking it up. I loved the idea behind this novel and the synopsis was pretty good. Who doesn't root for the underdog? I know I always do. Dumplin' follows a girl named Willowdean who's in High School. She's 17 and she's from texas. The only thing that matters in her town is the pageant. Obviously being the 'big' girl and the one that people pick on and make fun of will impact your self confidence and Willowdean has these self confidence issues. She fortunately has a best friend, Ellen, who is by her side all the time. Ellen is her supporting pillar and her confidence booster. They share every girly secret with one another. I enjoyed the beginning of the book where there was rather more of a humour tone in the writing but I felt that it got a little distracted by Bo and Mitch. I found the addition of Mitch unnecessary. I felt that one love interest was more than enough in this book and it was a little odd how the boys were throwing themselves at her after she literally had zero physical contact with boys for sixteen years. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BOOK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE PAGEANT. BUT IT WAS RARELY BROUGHT UP IN THE BOOK. AND THAT ENDING THOUGH......I seriously am mad at the ending. Like c'mon. I was teased enough about the details on the pageant. I just wanted more in the pageant!!Other than the divergent from what I expected from this book, the relationships in this book were great. Mainly Willow and Elle, Willow and Bo and Willow and Lucy. Oh and did I mention that there is a drag queen show segment in the book. That was cool. That was what the book lacked of. The actual PAGEANT!Alright, I'll stop my rants and get on with another book. ",en
475,18304322,1432608064,really liked it,"I really loved this book, and I couldn't put it down. I didn't think I would love it this much. I kept debating about reading it at all. It's just . . . not the sort of book I usually like. But my friends kept recommending it, librarian friends, author friends, and I thought, Well, why not?I was not disappointed, but very pleasantly surprised. This is a very different book from what I thought. Generally books about plus-sized teens are about weight loss, and even if they don't lose weight, they come to terms with it. This isn't about that, it's about much more. It's about being comfortable with your shape and size, no matter what that might be. It's about expectations are parents have of us, and what we have of them as parents, and of ourselves.I really loved the characters, all of them. Even the jerks. After a few pages, I just loved Willowdean so much, and I really loved Mitch. And Millie. (You go, girl!) And Lee and Dale! So great! What kept this from being five stars for me were just some little nitpicks. I had some little nitpicks with Bo, and with Ellen. I felt that several characters weren't being honest, and I didn't know why. They felt so real, though, that I really felt like, Why is HE being this way?

482,18304322,1240513877,it was amazing,"Review also appeared on my blog: Book Addict 24-7I received a copy via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest reviewMy review might contain spoilers (One person's spoiler is another person's non-spoiler). Proceed with caution.Julie Murphy really surprised me with her latest novel, Dumplin'. I honestly had no idea that this was the same writer of Side Effects May Vary. While I couldn't get past the first few chapters of her debut, I couldn't really put this book down once it had its hooks in me. The thing about Murphy's writing in her latest release is that it's so brutally honest that I couldn't help but relate and feel like this was a great way of approaching a topic like body image and accepting our differences. Dumplin' had a lot going for it. Willowdean, henceforth ""Will"", is a protagonist that introduces the story on a slightly different footing. Rather than having a protagonist who's insecure and unable to see herself in a certain way from the get-go, Murphy introduces a character who thinks she's got life figured out, only to have herself be challenged to ask herself what she really feels. My favourite quote from the book, hands down, is actually from the beginning of Dumplin' and is the kind of quote a reader might find near the end credits because it's so confident: ""The word fat makes people uncomfortable. But when you see me, the first thing you notice is my body. And my body is fat.[...]But that's me. I'm fat. It's not a cuss word. It's not an insult. At least, it's not when I say it. So I always figure why not get it out of the way?"" (Murphy 9--ARC edition, may be different in publication) This quote says so much and should prepare the reader for the story ahead. The quote basically embodies what Will struggles to accept throughout the book. She is confident sure, but when faced with life issues such as dating a cute guy, she begins to question herself. The fact that she mentions in the quote that the word fat isn't a bad thing ""at least, when [she] say[s] it"" is a hint that perhaps, she's not as confident as she wants to believe. She believes that calling herself fat isn't a big deal, but the real issues begin when she considers the thought of others thinking about her as fat without her permission. The reason why I love that quote and why I wanted to share that in my review is because it says so much without Will even knowing it yet. Murphy's writing is so great in this, that I'm really excited for readers to explore her world. Here is a book that features a heavier protagonist who isn't perfect, but she at least doesn't try to conform to the expectations of those around her. One major thing I liked about Will is that her self-esteem issues and character growth that she goes through is produced by her own thoughts. Why is this something I liked despite the negative aspects of it? Will is a character who is intriguing and it is her job to find out how wonderful she can be. She doesn't need someone else to confirm her awesomeness and self-worth. There may be nay-sayers in her world, but despite her insecurities, Will stands up against any potential bullying. It's incredible, but Murphy not only wrote a book about a strong plus-sized protagonist, but she did it without using fat shaming as a way of creating drama and suspense. If fat shaming was even hinted at in this book, Will shut it down real quick. I also liked that Will didn't have one of those personalities that shut down skinny people either. Sure, she noticed skinny people, but she didn't take them down verbally as a way to bring herself up. She did have moments of jealousy, but that was because of milestones she thought she'd never reach--all confidence issues. There are quite a few reasons why this book can potentially be really important in our changing society, but the greatest, in my opinion, is the ability to introduce a relatable protagonist who doesn't need to ride on the back of shaming to grow as a character. The side characters were awesome. Murphy has created a cast of memorable characters who all went through their own personal growth. This cast of misfits are spotlit for the reader while the rest of Will's world treats them like crap. In a way, Murphy is like Will in giving these three girls a chance to have a voice. Honestly, though, much like Will, a couple of these characters refused to play victims and I liked them all the more for it. Why have characters, who all have a chance to grow as people, who complain about their lives when you can have characters who focus on enjoying life instead? These characters also help show us that Will isn't perfect. She's a person who can feel jealousy, fear, envy, hate. She's human and she makes mistakes.The pageant thing was something else entirely. By the end of Dumplin', I found it interesting that the pageant was advertised as the major selling point for this book. There is so much more going on in Murphy's novel than a fat girl entering a beauty contest. In fact, the idea of signing up for the pageant doesn't even happen until halfway through the novel! Instead, anyone considering reading this novel should focus less on that and more on how complex human relationships can be, the trouble with how we want to see ourselves in a society that expects something else, and how imperfect familial relationships can be. Will's mom is another issue that some readers may find relatable. She is the kind of character that you begrudgingly like, even though you have a love/hate relationship with her. Keeping in mind that we are seeing the world through Will's eyes, we're a little biased regarding the mom issue. The constant comments about Will's weight and the hurt that Will feels at her mom's lack of mothering because (and this is Will's assumption) of her being overweight, make it almost impossibly hard not to hate her. But when you take into account that Will's aunt, who's just passed away--not a spoiler, you're told early on--played a dominant, almost motherly role in her life and may or may not have died because of her size, her mom's awkwardness and lack of filter regarding her weight might make a bit more sense. In fact, most of, if not all of, Will's positive memories as a kid are with her aunt and not her mom, which introduces the idea that they're not exactly a close pair in the first place. There's a bit of separation between the two characters that suggests that Will's actions may be a bit harsh in regards to her mother. This brings into sharp focus how limiting it is to get a story from just one perspective. Again, I'm not excusing the mother's actions, I'm just speaking from experience with my own mom. All I'm going to say about the love interest(s) is that Will's got game. Go, girl. I liked the conclusion and how Murphy decides to end it. In the words of Forrest Gump and fearing that I will spoil anything without meaning to, ""That's all I'm going to say about that."" I would definitely recommend this to other readers. Like I said somewhere in my rambling review: I think this is going to be a very relatable book for many readers facing all kinds of different confidence issues. Though my biggest issue with Dumplin' was the predictability of certain situations, the pacing is great and the story is captivating. Definitely looking forward to seeing what else Murphy will explore next. Happy reading!",en
483,18304322,2393063574,did not like it,"I do realise a lot of other readers enjoyed Dumplin' by Julie Murphy. I myself wanted to like this book so much that I was contemplating giving it at least one or two stars more. But of course, I can't do that because that's just wrong. I was   so, so, so excited   for this book that the day I saw it on Goodreads for the first time, I went and got it. I mean, everything about it was so appealing, first appearance wise. Firstly that cover because yes, I judge books by their covers and yes, I often get my money wasted because most of the time they turn out to be super disappointing and no, I still don't learn from my mistakes and yes, I still continue to judge books by their covers. The cover of course is nothing   flashy   but sure as hell is   catchy   in its simple sort of way. I mean it's one of those books that if you ever saw it in a bookstore you would buy it without even glancing at the blurb. Even though my raging excitement for this book was largely due to the blurb as well. The theme of the book came off so appealing to me. I was really looking forward to read about a protagonist who is not straight out of a fashion magazine for a change. A book about a girl with body insecurities and low self confidence who signs up for a beauty pageant and in the midst of all that finds self love and confidence in herself. And not to mention, I love pageants. This book was giving me little   Miss Congeniality   vibes. I loved that movie, and of course it wasn't really about self love and all that but I was reminded of it nonetheless. And so I started the book. And I couldn't finish it. I DNF'd it  twice.  I usually give my DNF'd books a second chance after sometime and since it was something I had been so up and about for, I really, really wanted to like it so show. But despite how much I tried, I couldn't make myself read it further. I didn't even reach the pageant part. The book was   bland.   I couldn't connect to it at all. It was like things were just happening, scenes were just shifting as I turned pages. There was no  excitement,  no  thrill,  nothing.And the worst part — Willow , our protagonist. I was so ready to love her but just after reading couple of chapters, I just wanted to take a fork and stab her name repeatedly whenever I saw it But of course, I can't do that. I love my books and no body is allowed to hurt them. Not even me. Willow is such a stupid and petty minded person. Okay, I get it. You have your insecurities. But that doesn't give you a ticket to be a bitch to other people.There was one scene, where Willow and her best friend El go to swimming at the pool and while they are inside it, Willow closes her eyes and starts to float in a relaxing herself. So when she comes out of her thing, she notices that El is talking to another girl, Callie, who is also her workmate beside the pool.So apparently you are not supposed to come out of the pool for a bit to say hi to your workmate because it's a big deal. Willow gets pissed off at El big time because she supposedly (gasps)  left her alone  when she went to say hi to her other friend just outside the pool. And they have a big fight on it. Now, I am not saying El or Callie are really nice characters and deserve all the love or anything. They were all petty and idiotic actually. In fact, none of the characters were likeable to me. Except perhaps for Millie, Amanda or Hannah.Millie is a really sweet girl who is fat as well. In fact, fatter that Willow. So now, how does Willow describe her? Let's see -  “Millie is that girl, the one I am ashamed to admit that I’ve spent my whole life looking at and thinking,  Things could be worse.  I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zippers in her size. Her eyes are too close together and her nose pinches up at the end. She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way.”  I am sorry, but that's not very nice. Also there is one part where she sees Millie approaching from somewhere to the parking lot and there is a jerk with his minions waiting near Millie's car so that they can make fun of her or whatever.  how original. Anyways, so Willow sees this, and being the kindest of all the angels she was, she goes to Millie and steers her away a bit and engages her in a conversation so those bullies would finally leave. Millie was in the middle of saying something when Willow noticed those idiots had left and then she just interrupted her midway saying she had to go and left. Okay I get it, Willow was being  nice  here but sorry, I don't need that sort of a pity conversation. I can fend for myself, thank you very much. Some more benevolent thoughts form out dear protagonist -  As I look over my review, Millie walks down our aisle of tables with a trayful of food and her best friend, Amanda Lumbard, not far behind. Millie and Amanda together are basically one giant moving target that says MAKE FUN OF US.Amanda’s legs are uneven, so she wears these thick corrective shoes that make her look like Frankenstein. (At least according to Patrick Thomas.) When we were kids and she didn’t have her shoes yet, Amanda just limped around, her hips swiveling up and down with each step. She never seemed bothered, but that didn’t stop people from staring. The nickname thing is pretty lame if you think about it. Frankenstein was the doctor, not the monster.  Or  The bell above the door rings, and in walk Millie and her friend Amanda with the corrective Frankenstein shoes. Millie wears a light yellow T-shirt and shorts set with little heart-shaped gems glued to the collar of her top. I wish there was a way for me to tell her all the ways she makes her life harder than it needs to be without me coming off as a bitch.”  At least they are confident enough to wear whatever they like and don't get all whiny and insecure when their friend dares to talk to someone else.As I said before, I felt no connection with the book or the characters whatsoever. The romance was just  okay.  Pretty boring actually. I also know there is a love triangle later on in the book though I never reached part. I get it, the book's main purpose isn't romance but if I were to talk about book boyfriends, sorry I couldn't find any.This book had tremendous potential. It could have been a wonderful book. I was definite that I will end up giving this book five stars when I saw it for the first time. Well, I guess, all of us get the opportunity to read one star reads once a while.Lol.",en
484,18304322,861376554,really liked it,"An advance copy of this title was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This review is based on a purchased copy of the audiobook, however. My thoughts are my own. This review can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue.Books set in Texas are my jam! Books set in Texas, written by Texas authors, and featuring Dolly Parton fanatics? Even better! I mean, seriously: ""Go big or go home."" Julie even mentioned Clay Dooley, a Ford dealership owner, as a pageant judge and I about died laughing. Because I'm assuming she's referencing Clay COOLEY, who owns about every type of car dealership imaginable in North Texas...except Ford. :PI kind of loved this empowering little book about accepting yourself as you are. Maybe not as much as the rest of the blogging community, but I was definitely entertained. The thing is, I try not to hold fictional characters to standards that I myself cannot achieve, but it was hard with Willowdean. I think it was the whole fact that she didn't take the beauty pageant seriously that bugged me the most. I don't really buy into the beauty pageant thing either, but Will entered for all the wrong reasons. And then she has the nerve to tell her best friend -- the one who's supported her through thick and thin (no pun intended) -- that she shouldn't enter the pageant because she might actually win. What kind of friend does that?I also didn't love the romantic elements, especially since there were two guys involved, but I did appreciate that she valued her dignity and ended things with one when the relationship got a little toxic. But rebounding with the sweetest mama's boy ever was the wrong choice. She was stringing him along, just like she had been, and that wasn't fair to either of them. But them's the breaks at that age...you live, you learn, you probably regret a little of it, but you (hopefully) come out a better person on the other side of things.This book is funny. Especially Willowdean's personal brand of self-deprecating humor. But she also has this voice that commands your attention. You just have to take notice of her. But it's not just her. All the girls who enter the pageant with her bring something special to the table. I just loved watching their weird little friendships grow.I haven't listened to much narrated by Eileen Stevens, but I thought she was a pretty good choice to narrate Dumpin'. She lets a hint of Southern drawl into her narration, especially when Willowdean's mama is around, but it's not overly twangy. I promise, we don't all have that twang, though if you ever heard my sister-in-law speak, I daresay you wouldn't believe me. ;0)What I like best about Julie Murphy's books is that she's not afraid to have her characters be human, to make mistakes, even when those same choices might make the characters unlikable. It's the same reason I really enjoyed Side Effects May Vary. Her characters resonate with me because they are real and genuine...they remind me of myself at that age. Bad judgment and all.GIF it to me straight:

MY THOUGHTS
Willowdean is a fat girl and she's not afraid to say it. She's comfortable in her own body, despite her mom's (the former beauty queen) insistence that she lose weight. Will grows feelings for her co-worker, Bo, and ends up having a summer relationship with her. For some reason, Will begins to feel doubt about herself, so she does something that she never expected to do: enter her mom's beauty pageant.I had high expectations for this book and it just wasn't what I expected. First of all, it was a bit boring. Will doesn't even get the idea to go into the pageant until more than halfway through the book! That's the main part of the book! And everything also felt incredibly draggy. Honestly, not a whole lot happened. Still, there were enjoyable moments.Besides the mostly positive reviews, I wanted to read this book because of the meaning it provides. This books deals with body positivity, something that the book world needs. I know that many, myself included, are not comfortable in their own skin and I like having a character that is actually comfortable in her skin, and heck, I like the fact that there's a fat MC without a focus on getting skinny (like most books).I must mention, though, that Will did bother me at times. She wasn't very good with her relationships. Meaning: she picked fights with those close to her and I thought some of it was unnecessary. For example: she got in a huge fight with her best friend,Ellen, because Will didn't want her to be in the pageant. Why? Because Ellen might actually win. Will wasn't aiming to win this thing and she wasn't letting her best friend enter because there's the small chance she might win. What? Will just have issues with relationships in this book. She was also against the misfits entering and was borderline judgmental about them. While I don't like some things Will did, we all have our flaws and some of the other characters weren't squeaky-clean either. It bothered me at points, but it's all realistic.There's romance in this book. I don't want to say much about the romance because it's just more of Will's bad decision making. She kind of rebounds and leads a poor, sweet guy on. I also didn't particularly like Bo's decision making either.
IN CONCLUSION
I know I sound like I didn't like this book. I kept complaining and complaining, but I actually liked it. Most of my complaining is because I heard so many amazing things about this book beforehand and was kind of let down. Overall, I liked the idea of this book and how it talks about being comfortable in your own skin. It's a needed book in the YA market.",en

“I guess sometimes the perfection we perceive in others is made up of a whole bunch of tiny imperfections, because some days the damn dress just won't zip.”
Me ha decepcionado un poco, tbh. Me parece perfecto que exista un libro con un mensaje tan positivo, pero a la vez he sentido que era como muy falso todo... (?) A veces parecía que era la autora la que hablaba por la prota y daba consejos. Que hasta yo me he sentido identificada con algunas cosas que le estaban pasando a Willowdean, y sé que hay gente a la que se la suda todo al final del día, pero no sé, no me ha terminado de llenar. En ningún momento he podido conectar con ella y la he juzgado mucho. Entiendo que tenga inseguridades pero la forma de tratar a su mejor amiga y otra gente sin pararse a pensar que les estaba haciendo daño me puede. El romance también me ha parecido sacado de la manga, puesto ahí para que veamos que incluso ella (y lo mal que suena esto eh, pero es el mensaje que me ha transmitido el libro) puede encontrar a alguien como Bo. Un poco a lo Finn y Rae de My Mad Fat Diary (?) solo que en ningún momento vemos la química y estamos todo el rato haciéndonos la misma pregunta que Will, “Why?” I drop my bag in the driveway. “Why do you want to be with this?” I wave my arm up and down the length of my body. Immediately, I hate myself for this. The only person making this about my body is me. Pues no sé, porque la autora lo dice, pero no lo demuestra. El porqué os gustáis es un misterio, aunque tengáis momentos cute. Arg, no sé, me da mucha rabia que no me haya gustado, tenía muchas esperanzas puestas en él desde que salió y en el fondo me alegro de que libros así existan. Pero meh. Esperaba más, la verdad.
“I’ve wasted a lot of time in my life. I’ve thought too much about what people will say or what they’re gonna think. And sometimes it’s over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn’t good enough. But you don’t have to bother with that nonsense. I wasted all that time so you don’t have to. If you go in there and you decide that this isn’t for you, then you never have to go back. But you owe yourself the chance, you hear me?”

God, she made me dislike her so much. The things that she said just rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't like it. I also didn't like how she viewed herself in this world. She deemed herself as ""the fat girl"" when she really shouldn't have. I guess I was just expecting this book to be about empowering women and not body shaming or anything like that. It's your body. It's your temple. Treat it the way you want to treat it. If you want to lose weight - great! Do it in a healthy way. Want to gain weight? Even better - you do you!I have nothing against people's body shape or anything. I love all kinds of people but Will.. oh will.. I wish I would've liked you. The constant comparing her body to other people was annoying. Her whining was annoying. So what if a dress doesn't fit you? So many things don't fit me but I'm not getting upset about it. Stores have different sizes. I could be a size 6 at Old Navy but like a size 8 or 10 at Ann Taylor. I don't care. If it fits - it fits.Then the whole Bo thing - ugh! The constant whining about him was especially annoying. I'm glad with the ending of the book and his last line and everything. But I didn't ship them at all throughout the book. She messed up. I just didn't care.Overall, it was okay. Annoying but okay. Would I reread it? Probably not - unless Will somehow becomes less annoying?",en

493,18304322,695484975,it was amazing,"Dumplin’ has been a long time coming. Sure, there have been some books about fat girls and embracing your body, but I don’t think there’s been one quite like Dumplin‘. In this case, you can totally judge the book by it’s cover: look at Willowdean, in her dress, looking fabulous and proud of who she is! Most books with fat girl heroines don’t put a girl on the cover, instead using bubble letters or food to represent her weight. In Dumplin’, there’s finally a book about how a girl can totally be a fat badass.I do think the hype affected my opinion of Dumplin’ a little bit. While I was very impressed, the voice wasn’t as voicey as I’d expected and it didn’t really hit me in the feels like I thought it would. That said, Dumplin’ is objectively a good book and a story that needed to be told. The beauty of the message is inextricably tied up with every other aspect, but I don’t think the message outshines everything else. This isn’t one of those books where the characters are merely vehicles for their message.Willowdean, called Dumplin’ by her mother, really loves herself most of the time. She’s confident, and she doesn’t mind being fat; it’s who she is, and she doesn’t see why that should mean she deserves less than other girls. Despite the fact that her mom has tried to force her onto diets and has always subtly shamed her for her weight, Will doesn’t want to change. She’s very lucky to have had her Aunt Lucy, who always made her feel perfect just the way she is. Lucy’s death has left Will’s foundations a bit shaky, and she’s not really sure how to interact with her mom or how to feel about herself. Dumplin’ is Willowdean’s journey to figuring out who she is again and regaining her confidence.What really stands out about Willowdean is that she’s a good person but she’s not always a great person. Like, she does everything while being a normal girl: sometimes bitchy, often stubborn, unsure of herself. It’s not like she wins everyone over because she has the most perfect personality known to mankind. She gets in a fight with Ellen that is 100% her own fault, something she doesn’t admit for a long time. During the book, she makes some other poor choices, and, though the other girls who entered the pageant as a statement turn to her as a leader, it’s clear that she’s not one. Willowdean also has a tendency to run away from her problems, like by changing jobs or trying to quit the pageant. She gets to be real and flawed and fat and beautiful and it’s magical.Will and her best friend Ellen are huge fans of Dolly Parton. I thought this was a bit weird when the book opened talking about Dolly Parton, ngl, but it ends up being perfect. For Will, Dolly is her idol of body positivity. Dolly’s been made fun of for her choices with her body (most notably plastic surgery), but Dolly loves herself exactly the way she is; her body is how she wants it and who gives a fuck about the opinions of others. Dumplin’ is not just about Will finding peace with her shape; Millie, Amanda, and Hannah also decide to join Will in the beauty pageant.The plot of the fat or awkward girls entering a beauty pageant could easily have gone very badly, but Murphy handles everything beautifully. I really love how the beauty pageant plot line resolved. It’s not easy, and the girls do face a lot of criticism, but they come out of it feeling stronger and having changed a few people’s opinions. Willow’s mom especially has learned something by Willow entering the competition. She’ll probably never stop wishing her daughter was shaped more like her, but I think she has a new appreciation for the beauty of her daughter, both inside and out.The romance, while not a super ship for me, was really great. The fat girl gets a super hot guy, not because she won him over with personality first, but because he thinks she’s gorgeous. Hallelujah. Bo’s got it bad for Willowdean, and I love that. Their casual relationship at the start of the novel is part of what sends Willowdean into a spiral of insecurity, but it’s all in Will’s head. Their relationship at the start had issues for sure, but Will made some assumptions about Bo based on his appearance that turned out not to be true. Once he determines to win her back, the cuteness is high. I only wish there’d been a bit less of an open ending there, but oh well.Looking for a read about loving yourself just the way you are? Get Dumplin’. I hope teens everywhere read it, and adults too, because we can all use a dose of body positivity.",en
494,18304322,1339181073,it was amazing,"his book was so freaking empowering, I loved it! I didn't really pay attention to this book when I first saw the cover, but after a few raving reviews I went back to read the summary and immediately went to download my copy. This book right here should be required reading in middle school or high school, it has such a great message for all girls. I don't think you have to be on the bigger side of the scale to appreciate the hell out of this book, because, who doesn't have insecurities about their bodies regardless of the number on the scale?Will is fat and she knows it and doesn't give a damn about it. She refuses to feel embarrassed or ashamed about her body and this right here made me instantly love her. When she starts to crush on her coworker, Bo, and he actually seems interested too, Will starts to doubt herself and her body. In order to get some of that confidence back, she does the unthinkable and enters the Miss Clover City Beauty Pageant. Beauty Pageants are a huge deal in her town, and her decision to enter starts to change a few things. Her best friend Ellie and her have a falling out, other girls who aren't normal beauty pageant material start to enter and her mother is on her case again to change. What started out as a silly impulse turns into something more now that all these girls are looking up to her and it seems like everyone else is waiting for her to fail. Will was the kind of MC that I love reading about. Strong and confident but she also has her flaws. She can be incredibly stubborn at times, but I still loved her. There are so many great quotes in this book that had my 'you go girl!' side coming out. I was rooting for Will and her friends the whole time and I kind of wish she would have put more effort into it. This book was almost perfection for me. A few issues I had with it were that I'm not a big fan of how Will kind of strung along Mitch. Yes, she did make it clear to him that she only was interested in being friends with him, but she also knew some of the things they did were leading him on, making him think it might turn to something more and she just let him think that. I don't consider this a love triangle at all, but I do wish the focus was more on Will's relationship with Bo. Another thing, and I might be in the minority here, but I wish the story didn't focus so much on the pageant. I liked that part of the story, but I really would have preferred if it focused more on Will dealing with her insecurities with Bo when it comes to dating. We finally have a normal girl who is nervous and embarrassed about what Bo thinks of her body, but that never really gets explored, which is a shame because I would have loved to have seen that. I know Will had major confidence about herself and the pageant and her new friends gave her even more confidence, but she still was worried about her body when it came to Bo. The outcome of the pageant didn't magically fix that. My last issue was that Ellen was a terrible best friend. She did and said some pretty terrible things to Will and I thought she might have been better off without her. I guess I'm not as forgiving as Will is, which is just another reason to like her. Despite these things, this book was just really fun and had such a great message. I would recommend this to all girls, no matter if they are teens or adults. I really hope we get more characters like Will and more body-positive books like this!4.5 out of 5 stars!

495,18304322,1370785894,it was amazing,"""I’m fat. It’s not a cuss word. It’s not an insult. At least it’s not when I say it.""I am in denial that this book is yet another resonating story about me. And I don’t want to be very talkative about my fat self here. First impression is this book is really great especially dealing with the message about Miss Dolly Parton, “It wasn’t just the look of Dolly that drew us in. It was the attitude that came with knowing how ridiculous people thought she looked, but never changing a thing because she felt good about herself. To us, she is…invincible.” If I would relate this to myself, I wish to believe that maybe I am feeling good about my body, but hell no! Reading the story of Willowdean Dickson the MC, has been a roller coaster ride for me since all chapters of her life are getting into my gut as well as realizing myself grinning about how Willowdean would define her harsh reality. I absolutely salute her for her bravery accepting and saying what is real by telling it as if it is normal, as if it not hurting. Dumplin' does not only tell how Willowdean Dickson, a 15 year-old, has become a hero to her friends and to the readers especially the young adult readers experiencing image crisis and peer pressures but this also talks about her relationship with her best friend, mother, her lost and relationship with an opposite sex. I love how Julie Murphy illustrates honesty in this book especially with the feelings, acceptance and frustrations of a beauty queen mother having a fat only girl daughter or the other way around how such struggle a daughter has to face the disgrace and disappointed a mother is having feeling that she (the daughter ) is a failure. I love how Willowdean treasures her friendship with Ellen Dryver and her loyalty and utmost love with Lucy. I know Lucy has become a figurative inspiration to Willowdean and Ellen. The only thing I find myself to roll is that about Mitch and Bo. Yes, Why not? A fat girl can have a handsome nice guy . But I can’t imagine how handsome Bo is or how fat or nice or sexy her brain is to deserve Bo. But I’ll stop myself from instigating or else I’ll fall to bored people saying something to Willowdean and yet, she belongs to my favorites.",en

Willowdean was such a lovable character: flawed but strong. This is a revolutionary depiction of a fat teenage girl who's allowed to have plotlines that aren't tied to her weight / weight loss, who's allowed to be strong and insecure at different times, who's allowed to be sexy and pretty and fat.

498,18304322,2645225902,liked it,"Dumplin is told in the first person, she is in high school dealing with her overweight issues, friends and first love. Apparently, her weight has always been a divisive matter between her mother (former beauty queen pageant winner of the Clover City Miss Teen Blue Bonnet). Now a promoter and working on the pageant as board member and employee for the infamous pageant for the small town Texas community, she wavers between being supportive of her daughter's foray into pageant life. Dumplin (Willowdean or Will as her closest friends call her) is an inspiration to five other young women including her best friend, El. What starts as an attempt to prove that fat women should not be disqualified from beauty pageant's solely because of their life being defined for a less flattering characteristic, which is a divisive agent in her life and the ""beauties"" of her community. For this story the other girls are also outcasts for handicaps, weight, crooked teeth or being lesbian.Willowdean is also torn between two men. The one guy is a fellow student and co-worker, Bo, who she considers out of her league due to his 'hot bod' and status in sports and while the other, Marcus is a fellow student, who is also on the football team and though noticeably over weight, he is also popular. Marcus treats her well and is very respectful, the foil to Bo. Bo initially keeps their relationship on the down low and she can't quite trust him when he tells her, he wishes to go public. Torn between her attraction, Bo and the respectfulness of Marcus sans attraction, Will struggles with her body image as well where it relates to these two young guys.Will also struggles with her loyalty to El because she develops friendships that make Will more uncomfortable with herself image. What will Will do? I'm not telling...This is a true to life look at weight issues and other body image issues young women face in early adulthood and its impact on self esteem in young women. I found it as something I could identify with based on my teenage experiences and I'm sure that many others will find they do at some level as well. I think this should be on English Lit for college prep. The writing is smooth and attempts at humor, it is not quite on par with Rainbow Rowell but it is good by its own virtue.",en

I just absolutely adored Willowdean. I love that she was strong and confident and her struggle with her different body issues felt very true to me. I love that she wasn't perfect, and that sometimes she was a sh** daughter and a sh** friend and she recognized that but didn't do much to change it (at least at first). She was just so easy to relate to and teenage me would have seen so much of myself in her. Her relationship with her mother, her deceased aunt, her friends, the other pageant girls, Bo, etc. was intriguing and full of layers and I liked that. I especially like that she didn't lose weight or anything, she was different by the end of the book because SHE chose to be, not because anyone else forced her to be via her physical self. I would have liked to see more of her relationship with her mother, because I found their interactions so fascinating, but that is a small quibble.

Sí, también entiendo que tiene un problema de obesidad en una ciudad llena de princesas y que tiene cero contacto con hombres por la inmensa cantidad de inseguridad que tiene pero eso no le justifica:1. Ser una egoísta y pretender que su mejor amiga no puede tener una vida aparte de ella porque es su confidente/ancla/única persona en la que puede confiar/etc.2 Ser tan mezquina como para creer que todo el mundo tiene que detener sus vidas para que vayan al ritmo de ella, o que ella tenga que hacer todo primero y ser la guía del resto. (Viviendo en una ciudad llena de barbies en donde lo más fascinante y destacado son los concursos de belleza y que por ende significa, según el típico cliché, que la mayoría de ellas son unas ridículas que se juran la última Coca-Cola del desierto quedé impactada porque la única que se creía el centro del planeta/la última Coca-Cola/la última hamburguesa/la última papa frita de la caja/idk/etc era ella, lo juro.) TODO TENÍA QUE GIRAR ALREDEDOR DE ELLA SI O SI PERO AÚN ASÍ ELLA ERA UN ASCO, UNA ABOMINACIÓN, NO ENCAJABA, NADIE ESTABA PENDIENTE DE ELLA, EN FIN...3. Que se comporte como una bebé de dos años porque no tiene lo que quiere. Y no porque no se pueda, si no porque ella no quiere. Quiero decir: se siente como un asco porque está obesa y le da pánico tener un final como el de su tía pero aún así no hace un esfuerzo por evitarlo. Sí, entiendo la cuestión del libro que es aceptarse a uno mismo sin tomar en cuenta la opinión del resto; No te digo que tienes que hacer dietas locas y matarte a punta de ejercicio para adelgazar y tener cuerpo de princesa, te digo que te cuides al menos un poco porque no puedes decir que tienes miedo de morir por obesidad mientras te comes severa hamburguesa. Es estúpido.4. Tratar a todo el mundo como la peor mierda nada más porque no estás contenta con el universo. O sea hija... Tus problemas son tuyos y está bien que te sientas molesta al respecto pero no puedes cargarte a alguien porque ""le va mejor que tú"" cuando ni siquiera sabes si esa persona está pasando por algún problema, o si lo está y consideras que el tuyo es peor. Cada persona en el mundo tiene algún problema en su vida y jamás será mejor o peor que el tuyo porque eso ya es cuestión de cada quién pues.La idea del libro en realidad es fantástica y estaba emocionada por leer about superación y aceptación pero lo único que agarré del libro fueron quejas sin sentido. Por lo menos esperaba un cierre en donde ella recapacitara sobre todo lo que estaba haciendo mal o que fuera, por lo menos, consciente de ello y que quisiera hacer un cambio pero no. Todo fue como: quejas, quejas, quejas, entrar en el concurso de belleza para demostrar que puedo hacer un cambio, quejas, quejas, quejas, quejas, quejas. Y sí, sin final y sin ningún cambio porque el final fue demasiado abrupto y sin sentido y porque ella no logra ningún cambio real. Sí, la decisión de entrar al concurso hizo que otras chicas se motivaran pero ella realmente nunca estuvo interesada en ello y las que demostraron un cambio en el libro fueron las otras chicas, que por cierto eran personajes secundarios, so... ¿Para qué carajos estaba la protagonista ahí?La puntuación es más como un 1.5 y créanme que eso es muy alto pero me mantuvo, de cierta forma, entretenida por un rato.",es

First of Will’s character was going through some emotional roller coaster. One minute everything would be fine and the next everything is bad. It irritated me a lot when she kept blaming Bo for her insecurities. He did nothing of the sort to make her doubt herself, in fact he compliments her and is nice.

To be fair, after I got through the first third of this book I was able to enjoy it enough. Not love it liked I hope, but enjoy it.The first third though.There was nothing, that was holding my interest and it was just so boring and blah on so many levels. I was expecting Willowdean to be this firecracker who didn’t care jack shit about what size her butt was.But nope.She whined, moped, and accused anyone of hating her because of her size. She made judgments about other characters-a.k.a. MillieShe judged.A lot.And she judged so much throughout the book, to the point I wanted to punch her. Though, she did have her moments where I could forgive her (kneeing a certain jerk in the nuts gave her bonus points).The thing was the blurb advertised a self confident character, and this character really didn’t have much-if any-self confidence.All her actions rooted from being insecure.Even entering the pageant which was a shame. The pageant part was really underplayed. I was hoping for something that was a bit more of Bridesmaids with maybe some Pitch Perfect, but that wasn’t how those scenes were done at all.It wasn’t bad.Just not the complete awesomeness I was hoping for.It was the same with the romance. To be blunt about it, the romance angle was something I’ve seen in plenty YA books and it’s pretty exasperating. The only difference was that we had a main character that wasn’t a size two playing the role of the center piece in the triangle.And despite the fact that Will might be more relatable physically, her action are still jerkish a la Bella Swan and a host of others.I didn’t like how she treated either boy. And I thought one of them was a jerk to her, and the other guy deserved a lot more than he got.One thing I really hate when I read is the excuse of “chemistry”. Like the nice guy isn’t good enough because there was no “chemistry” there.Bull freaking shit.That’s what I wanted to tell Will and a host of others characters before her who act this way. While I get chemistry plays an important part in any relationship, if he’s a jerk he’s a jerk. Nothing’s going to change that.Pulling out hair moment, right there.I will say though, even though there are a lot of hair pulling moments in this book, there were a lot of moments that made me smile. I liked all the Dolly Parton references. How Dolly plays a role throughout the book, and I loved, loved, loved, the Dolly drag club scene.That was probably one of the best scenes in the book.I also like Will’s new friends. I wanted more time spent on them. Again, I was expecting something more akin to Bridesmaids or Pitch Perfect-you know misfit female cast being awesome. But it just doesn’t seem like it was meant to be here.If you don’t make expectations before reading Dumplin’ you’ll probably enjoy it. The book does highlight North Texas pretty well. Several of the things that Will experienced, I nodded my head to because, well, it was something I had experience with.I just really didn’t like the fact that this was more and less focused on a love triangle with yet another self conscious slightly bitchy character.",en
506,18304322,1373603663,liked it,"There’s not a lot to not like about Dumplin’. It’s a thoughtful examination of the ridiculous pressure we put on teenage girls to match up to modern Western beauty standards, and the damaging effects those impossible standards have on their self-esteem. Yet Dumplin’ didn’t capture my interest like I expected it to, and several times I considered giving up and shelving it.In Dumplin’, self-proclaimed fat girl Willowdean Dickson sets out to prove a point to herself and the rest of her town, by entering the local beauty pageant. Despite what the blurb would have you believe, though, Dumplin’ isn’t a story about a girl who wants to win a beauty contest - even after she enters, Will is apathetic about (and most of the time, downright dismissive of) the pageant. The real plot of Dumplin’ is Willowdean’s changing relationships with her friends, family and love interests as she sets out to recover her flagging sense of self-worth.Written that way, it sounds near-perfect, but I had a few problems with Dumplin’ - I didn’t find either love interest appealing, I found the pacing poor, and a lot of Murphy’s references to the cultural quirks of American small towns went right over my head (I’m still not entirely sure what a mum garter actually is but it definitely does not sound like an appropriate gift to give your date). However, Willowdean was the highlight of Dumplin’; I have high standards for YA protagonists, but Willowdean met them all. While her love interests were forgettable, Willowdean was a fascinating, realistic and wonderfully relatable teenage character. At one point, Will remarks that she both loves and hates her body, and wonders how both things can be true - how she can feel so comfortable and confident, and yet have so little self-esteem. Willowdean was everything I look for in a protagonist, and despite the book’s failings, Willowdean’s thoughtful asides kept me wanting to read on.As much as I loved Willowdean, though, I was disappointed by her misogynistic snark about her fellow competitors; I kept expecting Willowdean’s attitude towards the girls who weren’t part of her circle of friends to change, but sadly it never did. Dumplin’ does a good job of exploring how Western beauty standards effect the girls who don’t fit them, but Murphy dismisses the negative effects of beauty standards on the girls who do.Despite my mixed feelings on Dumplin’, I do recommend it to anyone who likes contemporary realistic young adult fiction. It’s a diverse, quick read, the story feels original, and it’s refreshing to read a book in which all the characters feel like real people for a change.

507,18304322,2343476251,liked it,"3,5 starsWARUM WOLLTE ICH ES LESEN? Dumplin' hat bereits im amerikanischen Raum sehr, sehr hohen Wellen geschlagen und so war ich sowieso unendlich gespannt. Dazu kommt, dass sich der Roman unter anderem mit dem Thema Body Positivity auseinandersetzt. Absolut wichtig und lesenswert!HAT ES MEINE ERWARTUNGEN ERFÜLLT? Zu großen Teilen ja!WAS HAT MIR GUT GEFALLEN? Der Roman ist eigentlich ein typischer Jugendroman, der sich mit den Dingen auseinandersetzt, die in dem Alter von Relevanz sind. Dazu eben das Thema Body Positivity, das ich sehr toll umgesetzt fand. Auch ganz abgesehen davon ist der Roman absolut lebensbejahend und toll geschrieben. Nebenbei gab es einige tolle Charaktere - besonders waren es Nebencharaktere - die ich sehr ins Herz geschlossen habe.WAS HAT MICH GESTÖRT? Mir war die Vielzahl an Themen etwas too much, weshalb für mich das Thema Body Positivity nicht genügend in den Vordergrund gerückt wurde, was mich dann doch sehr gestört hat, da ich das Buch eben nicht wegen der Xten Freundschaftsproblematik gelesen habe. Auch muss ich zugeben, dass mir die Protagonistin auch nicht immer ganz sympathisch erschien.FAZIT. Dumplin' ist ein Buch mit einer wahnsinnig tollen Thematik und einer lebensbejahenden Geschichte, die es so viel häufiger geben müsste. Besonders das Thema Body Positivity fand ich toll und doch rückte es für meinen Geschmack zu sehr in den Hintergrund. | ???(?)?",de
508,18304322,1818667720,liked it,"I get the importance of this book about a fat girl. But I did not love this book. First of all, everybody is talking about Will participating in the beauty pageant, even the blurb of the book, but the idea begins to form in her head only halfway the book! So, in my opinion, this is a huge spoiler. But because it is in the blurb, I did not put it in a spoilertag here. But really, if the book is about the pageant, make her enter sooner in the book, or don't put it in the blurb but this made me inpatient.Also, I don't really like Will, by character. (view spoiler)[I think she was wrong to tell Ellen not to participate. I think she is leading both boys on. If you really really really like someone, like the writer wants us to believe Will likes Bo, it is impossible for your head to win from your heart. (hide spoiler)]And I don't like the ending. I get it with the meaning of this book and all, (view spoiler)[that it shouldn't matter and stuff,  (hide spoiler)] but I just can't handle this XDI did enjoy buddyreading this book with Lisa in the last days of the year! but i did not really enjoyed the book. I liked how it was written about body issues and stuff, hence no 2* because that feels to less for this book, but I cannot give it any more than 3.

""Beautiful, he says. Fat, I think. But can't I be both at the same time?""
Overall, I enjoyed this book. It did felt a little bit like a Disney movie or those kind of movies, so I guess it's good that they are going to do that. To be honest, the characters were my biggest problem, they were just so unlikeable. Maybe I'm just grumpy, but Will, the main character, was a really bad friend, and El was a really bad friend and their fights and reconciliations felt unnecessary, like in the real world that wouldn't happen.But again, the characters not always have to be 100% likeable. I liked Will's drive and character development, I thought that the ideas that she had at the end of the book were really positive and something that I would like to have read when I was a teenager. I liked the romance, I thought it was believable and cute. I thought it was good to show such a flawed relationship, because no relationship is perfect, right? But I just hated her mother so much. I mean, she's been told time and again what her daughter doesn't like to be called or told or what it hurts her, and she just couldn't understand. I don't know, it felt more hurtful than funny.I think it could have been better, but it was really funny, relatable and easy to read. Update 16/11/2015: I decided to change the rating to 2 stars because I can only remember the horrible things about this book",en

I thought this would be the type of book to really make people feel good about themselves but it was the opposite. There was so much judgement in this book. We have the main character continuously judging people on their body size whether they were considered 'skinny' or 'fat. There was continuous girl hate. There was SO MUCH wrong with this book.

519,18304322,2668733440,really liked it,"Book and Movie NotesAbout the Book: (3.5/5) I finished reading Dumplin' a couple of days ago and I can totally see why the book has resonated with so many people and why it has been so popular since it has been released. Overall, there is a very positive message and certainly the story touches its target demographic in some very vulnerable places like body image, self-esteem, and even grief (which I thought was very well-handled). These issues strike a chord without being heavy-handed; in fact, the story is lighthearted and funny in some places. So, yes, this is a very good book in terms of how it left me feeling very positive and uplifted at the end. I do think that the secondary cast is what I'll take from the story more than Willowdean's character. They were outstanding, albeit stereotypical, in every single case-from the atypical group of pageant participants Willowdean reluctantly forms friendships with, to the people Willowdean works with at Harpy's, to her best friend Ellen, to my personal favorites: Willowdean's love interests. I even felt like her mother is more memorable to me. Willowdean is the star of the story, but I do feel like she sort of floated through the story because everyone else carried her and without the others, there would be less of a story to tell. Also it was interesting to me that there was a love triangle in this one because it was just not needed. I'm not anti-love triangle when they progress the story, but I just could not figure out the justification for the second love interest in this case. Both Bo and Mitch were delightful, mannerly, wonderful guys that any girl would be lucky to date. So the more that Willowdean strung them both along while she made up her mind which one she wanted, the more it broke my heart for both of them. I know that girls go through indecision often in real life, but wow this was painful. Willowdean's insecurities caused pain to other people, and that was hard for me to read in such a lighthearted book. In any case, the story was a fun, light read and enjoyable. It is an easy recommendation for me to make, especially to the target demographic of teens and young adults, and at least one of the teens in my household has expressed interest in picking Dumplin' up and reading it now that we've also seen the movie. I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. Thank you, WunderbooksPR and Balzer + Bray!Find this review and more like it on my blog, Into the Hall of Books!About the Movie: (4/5) I LOVED sitting down with my family last night to watch the movie after finishing the book-we all adored the movie. I think they did a great job adapting the book and keeping as much of the content in as possible. Of course, there are scenes in the book that aren't in there, but I love the way that many of those scenes are referenced in the movie. So those of us that have read the book would pick up on those little nods. For example, the slumber party scene in the book didn't make it to the movie, but there is a little part where Millie invites the other girls to a slumber party-little lines and references like that make reading it first extra fun. The actors that were chosen to play the characters bring them to LIFE. They make the fantastic secondary cast even more fantastic. I'm not even sure how, but they just do. And they change the movie a little bit so that it is love triangle free, holla! I'd definitely recommend reading the book first (always!) but the movie is such a treat, especially when you watch with friends or family. It's hilarious! By the end, my cheeks were sore from smiling so much-my family and I had been cheering on Willowdean and her friends at the pageant and we just loved how it turned out! Definitely watch it if you can!!Also, the movie is more family-friendly in term of age than the book is. There are a few swear words but it is just fine for the younger ones to watch. If you're curious, check out Common Sense Media's Dumplin' movie review for specifics. As for the book, I'd save it for when they're legit young adults.",en
520,18304322,1289110734,,"Okay, so I'm not rating this one, because - it's complicated. I was reading this as a fat-acceptance YA, and the fact that I found it wasn't made it impossible to see it any other way. FWIW, if I'd come to it with no fat politics expectations and somehow managed to read it as just a YA which had problematic treatments of fatness, I'm pretty sure it still wouldn't have been a win. A disclaimer first: I'm not an expert on fat-positivity in children's/YA books, but I care about it deeply, and have learned - hopefully am still learning - from three of the smartest women I know: Deborah Kaplan, Rebecca Rabinowitz, and my daughter Becca. So. Dumplin' has a fat protagonist, who doesn't lose any weight through the course of the book, and that is a very good thing. However, there are many aspects of the book that are problematic, and some act to undercut the fat acceptance message that's supposed to be there. I'm going to do points, because in a way, that's how I feel about the book; it is quite muddled, and not just about the supposed fat-positive message.- First, and most disappointing, is the fact that Willowdean's aunt Lucy, who died a year before the book begins, was your stereotypical destroyed-by-fatness character. She had been fat all her life, had been utterly confined by her self-image problems and fear, and died of a massive heart attack sitting home alone on the sofa. (It doesn't help that Willowdean draws attention to the difference between herself and her aunt, by saying she was big, 'not like me, but like 500 plus pounds big'. No quotes are direct btw, as I gave my copy to Becca.) This, right here, would be enough to kill any hopes of an overall fat-acceptance book, but there's also quite a bit of cliche wrapped up in Lucy's slightly secret life as 'good people' over in a nearby drag bar, to which she seems to have gone because of her Dolly Parton fandom. We're mostly shown repeatedly how she's too afraid of what others will think to go out much, and then, conveniently, Willowdean and her three 'friends' go to the bar, and are welcomed warmly by the regulars, one of whom is soon teaching them to walk in heels, getting smashed on cocktails, and saying how much she wishes there'd been girls like Will & co. when SHE was in high school. - Back to the 'friends' mentioned above. Near the beginning Willowdean says of one of them (Millie, I think), that she's the kind of person who makes her life look pretty good; most of that seems to be because she's - wait for it - fat, but also she -- what? Is fat and 'asks' to be bullied (there really is a line to that effect), because she .... I got nothing. Millie's best friend Amanda (I think), isn't fat, but does wear corrective footwear because of different leg length (I think again). She is equally said to be virtually wearing a 'be mean to me' sign - clothes? Probably clothes. Third, much more reluctant addition to this little group that decides to join the beauty pageant, is Hannah, who has big, horse teeth. (view spoiler)[and is a lesbian. Um, not at all clear about the significance of that, though it isn't at all organically presented, so there should be. (hide spoiler)]- Although the blurb description says that Will ""she sets out to take back her confidence by doing the most horrifying thing she can imagine"" in joining the beauty pageant, it's nothing like as reasoned a decision. Having decided to join up, she then tries hard to persuade Millie and Amanda from doing so too, because they'll be tormented for doing it. Uh, yeah. - Bo. Yikes. He starts making out with her by the dumpster at work, and then every night after work (in totally unpopulated spot), and so hormones are calling all the shots, *except* when he touches her back. So we have this doubly messed-up relationship, as he doesn't acknowledge her outside of work (wait - not in work either!), and she obsesses about how disgusted she is at the idea of him feeling her fat-rolls and bulges. But all he has to do is kiss her... !!! - and Will herself. First she puts up with this, she doesn't tell her best friend anything about him, and as soon as she realises he'll be coming to her school in autumn but hadn't told her and gives him the boot, she uses another really nice guy who likes her a lot. Oh, and she tells her best friend not to join the pageant too.Important point: I KNOW that we're all flawed, young, middle-aged, and elderly alike, and that YA is full of 'realistically mistake-making teens'. No reason at all that fat protagonists shouldn't be allowed be as nasty as any others. But, neither does it mean that a character who's repeatedly selfish and yammers on about how she 'deserves' this, that and the other, is going to get a lot of extra readerly breaks because she's fat. Yup, society sucks, and fatphobia is everywhere, (including in this book, I'm afraid), but doesn't mean you can play the fat card too many times.- At one point Mitch, the other guy, knocks into something or the like, and Will thinks that it's nice for a change 'cos she is usually the 'spastic' one. NO. Just no.- Will and her best friend have a fight that goes on for a good half of the book, and it's disturbing for two reasons. First, because her friend Ellen is thin-and-pretty, she's being courted by the other popular thin-and-pretty girls, who are - shocker - mean, and - oh, could it be bitchy? Why yes it could. And is. What's never addressed, even at the very end when the fight is resolved, is that Ellen has already been listening to the nasty things they've said about her friendship with Will, as is obvious when they get into the fight. Getting mad for a horrible thing Will actually said is one thing, but listening to people who say your friendship with someone you've been close to for most of your life is 'holding you back'? Not so much. MEAN GIRLS BEING MEAN. So tired of this being the default.- The final point I'm going to make about the fat-politics is that right near the end, when Will is doing the beauty pageant, there's quite a long passage in which she thinks how disgusting her thighs seem to her sometimes. And it's long, and it's unnecessary, and what could anyone think it adds to the book? Yeah, people internalise the negative reactions, we know that - putting out yet another 'fat bodies are disgusting' passage into the world won't exactly help deal with the problem.Way (*way*) back at the beginning, I said that I didn't think this would have worked even if I'd been able to set aside hopes that it was one of a small handful of really positive YAs with fat protagonists. Part of that was that at the end - spoiler alert, but really, much as I hoped it wouldn't happen, I was never in doubt that she'd end up with one of the guys - she has a big meltdown and tells Dude X that she can't possibly be with him because people would think (essentially) she was too fat to be with a good-looking guy like him. He tries to talk her around, but virtually all he says is 'who cares' (which has to be said), and 'I think you're beautiful and I want to be with you in public'. I wasn't for a second thinking that he wouldn't like her because she's fat, but I did really get hung up on why he would like her. She just wasn't that nice, and really wasn't all that interesting either, so I'm not seeing it. Hardly makes for a good romantic plot line.",en
521,18304322,1108853360,it was amazing,"I have been hearing nothing but awesome things about Julie Murphy's Dumplin' ever since, man, ALA Midwinter? Before then? I don't know. But it's about dang time somebody got a book with a fat protagonist right, and Murphy nailed it. I mean nailed. It. See, Dumplin' isn't a Problem Novel (Great Old Ones, how I hate that term). The protagonist isn't perfect--in fact, she does some pretty mean and stupid things. Yeah, like every teenager in the history of ever. She is sassy and smart and very vocal about her body. But one of the best things about Dumplin' is that it got me really interested in Dolly Parton. Seriously. And now I'm hooked and I can't stop because DOLLY!That's pursuant to the book, but let's talk a little bit more about the book. We'll have time for Dolly later.Willowdean Dickson lives in Clover City Texas with her mother, a former Miss Teen Blue Bonnet pageant winner. Momma is all about running the pageant now. It's her liiiiiiiiiife. Point of pride? She can still fit into her winning gown, even after having Willowdean as a bit of a surprise baby. Will and her mom aren't active antagonists; rather, there's a tense bubble around what they don't say to each other about Will's size. And about Lucy. I'll let Will tell you what happened. ""At the age of thirty-six, weigning in at four hundred and ninety-eight pounds, lucy died. She died alone of a massive heart attack, while sitting on the couch, watching one of her shows. No one saw her die. But then again, no one outside of this house really saw her live. And now there's no one here to remember her.""And now Will's mom wants to get rid of Lucy's things and turn her old bedroom into a craft room. Will is not amused. Plus, there's some serious love drama going on. Will's best friend Ellen, their friendship created and cemented over a mutual adoration of Miss Dolly Parton, matter-of-factly states that she wants to have sex with her boyfriend, Tim. At the same time, Bo, über-hot cook at the fast food joint where Will works, is ... talking to her? Paying her attention? Hoo boy, wouldn't she like to kiss those cherry-sucker-stained lips, but what would a guy like Bo want with a fat girl like her? But things get steamier and it's clear that Bo really likes ... loves? Will. Her. The way she is. And the thought is scarier than anything else. ""I won't be ridiculed. I won't be one-half of the couple who everyone stares at and asks, How did she get him?""I think that is seriously one of the most authentic reactions I've read in literature in a very long time. It's not that Will doesn't care about Bo--she does--but when society looks at your size first and your face second and then maybe takes the time to ask your name, you have been taught that you are not good enough. You are not skinny enough for Bo. And how would that make him look? How would you endure the taunts? How would he? Would it just doom you?Now, when I was reading, I wanted to say, ""Willowdean, that boy loves you. He is not a tease and he's not cruel."" But I am speaking from a place of privilege. I am not fat. I was quasi-fat (half-fat?) in high school, but I didn't care about anything except grades back then so I was not interested in a boyfriend (plus I was two years younger than everyone else which seemed like a massive gap). But I do think Will's reaction is very realistic. All her life, she's been made to feel less-than because of her more-than size. And now she's got something good. Really good. Isn't it just like life to take it away?And so begins Miss Willowdean's self-destructive hate-spiral. She pushes Bo away, has an epic fight with Ellen, and keeps telling herself that she's right. She's right for being mean to Ellen because she deserved it. She's right for pushing Bo away because she doesn't deserve him. ""My whole mind has turned against me. Every time I blink, all I see are my flaws ... Before this summer, I'd always been happy in this skin. Proud even. But then came Bo. Since that first time we made out in the cab of his truck, I've felt myself cracking. Something about the way his skin felt against mine drew all these doubts to the surface that I didn't even know I had.""And as a final middle finger-up to the world, she enters the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet competition and starts a chain of events that's wild and funny and heartbreaking and uplifting. Suddenly, all of the other girls who are outcasts join Will in her quest for the Blue Bonnet tiara. There's Millie, ""the one I am ashamed to admit I've spent my whole life looking at and thinking, Things could be worse. I'm fat, but Millie's the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants ... She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way."" Plus Millie's BFF Amanda, who has uneven legs and has to wear corrective shoes. And then there's Hannah Perez, a tough-talking, take-no-prisoners girl who's constantly taunted about her teeth. On their wild ride, they go to a Dolly Parton-themed drag show, get walking tips from a drag queen, lie to Millie's ultra-conservative parents, and generally toss the whole pageant upside down. Atta girls. Okay, look, guys, this book is far more complex than I'm (horribly) making it out to be. It's a frank discussion about what it means to be fat. It's a portrait of a girl who isn't perfect and isn't always the nicest but who realizes that she needs to make things better. It's body-positivity at it's best and most real--because seriously, nobody loves their body all the time. It's an ode to Texan living and to being unapologetically you, à la Dolly. I have all these quotes marked because they're utterly hilarious but if I listed them all I'd a) take up way too much space and b) ruin them for you. Y'all need to read this. Stat.I was so relieved and happy to read this book. As someone who struggles with self-image, I needed this. So much. And then, I got curious about Dolly Parton. I noticed that Nine to Five was on Netflix and ... boom. Insta-Dolly-love. The fact that the movie is pee-yourself-hilarious doesn't hurt either. I've been easing into her music and although I wouldn't say I'm a country western fan, I think I might be a Dolly fan. And let us all remember these words of wisdom:""There is no higher achievement for a southern woman than the ability to eat barbecue and walk away stain free."" Amen, Willowdean. Amen.",en

Although I liked Bo's character, there was definitely a lack of development in his and Willowdean's relationship. They have a secret relationship during the summer but I never really understood why Willowdean liked him and why he liked her. There was another character, Mitch, introduced in the story, who is really kind and likable but it's made into a bit of a love triangle, which I didn't like. Willowdean obviously had feelings for Bo and she didn't have feelings for Mitch but she continues to lead him on - even though she knows she shouldn't.I really liked the friendships that were formed between Willowdean and the other girls who entered the beauty pageant with her. I enjoyed reading the beauty pageant part of the story but I felt the ending was really abrupt and it left me wanting a bit more closure. There was body positivity in this book but Will also seemed pretty judgmental about other people. However, it was empowering to see girls who society deem as not ""beautiful"" or ""good enough"" enter a beauty pageant.",en

I did find the book was a little “soft” in that it skirted around and glazed over some larger issues it was addressing, but that lack of depth is also what kept the story southern sweet. Highly recommend!Loss of a star because it seemed to end abruptly. There was a long, slow but steady build with and ending that felt too quick and incomplete.

529,18304322,1346601815,it was amazing,"I really enjoyed this book. Like really enjoyed this book. Yes, it had some problems but I can see some many good points to the book. I have to admit, this was definitely a 4-star book for me but the ending made the book for me. You go Williowdean!When I first heard about this book, I got really excited because I have never read a book with an overweight character before and I just really wanted to read it. The book definitely reached my expectations, it was well-written and really nice characters and a greatly entertaining plot that definitely promotes self confidence and being who you are. Plot: Dumplin' follows the life of Williowdean, an overweight character who is doesn't care about her weight but her relationship make her doubt herself. This is a book about re-finding self-confidence and learning to love yourself.  Overall, I really enjoyed the plot of Dumplin' as it was about self-confidence and discovering to love yourself however the majority of the book did focus on the coming of the pageant rather than the pageant itself. Saying this I did enjoy the the things that led up to the pageant and the daily life of Williowdean as it was nice to read about. I also really liked how the plot dealt with Lucy and how she was put into the story and I definitely liked the connection of Williowdean and Lucy and how this leads to other events occurring in the books. I really enjoyed the love triangle in relation to the book as I thought that both boys were equally as lovable and would be increasingly hard to pick between them. Even though I disliked the fact that not a lot of the plot dealt with the pageant itself, I liked the way the whole pagaent got together and it was nice to see what each of the characters was doing in terms of the pageant. The pageant itself was definitely done and it the time that Williowdean shines. This was the time for me that Dumplin' changed from a good book to a great book. Characters: Overall, I really enjoyed the characters in this book, they were all developed in number ways and I liked reading about them. My favourite character was definitely Williowdean because she was very confident in herself from the beginning of the book. Some people argue that she is not, however she does go to a outside pool in her swimming costume which is something that I would never consider doing, so me she is confident. However I would argue that she does start to believe in herself towards the end of the book especially in the pageant scenes. Williowdean can be quite mean at times but this does not take away from her character and does not make her any less loveable.  The side characters of Bo, Mitch and Ellen all need a meant as well as they were all nice characters and their stories evolved over the course of the book. This can be seen with Bo especially as we definitely see more about him as a character as the story continues. Mitch was a character that I also really enjoyed and found him a really sweet and nice. Like Bo and Mitch, I also really liked the character of Ellen especially her friendship with Williowdean although their friendship is rocky over the course of the story. The other friends of Williowdean were also really nice to read about especially about them growing in confidence and loving them-self more which is a nice addition to the story.  The main problem I had character wise was the Williowdean's mother as I just didn't like the way she treated Williowdean. I didn't like the fact that she called her Dumplin' as I didn't find it very empowering. I know that Williowdean embraces the name near the end of the novel but it just did not seem right to me....Writing:Dumplin' was a really well written book and overall, I really enjoyed it. The writing definitely was inspiring and was very quotable, meaning that there were lots of quotes that I just wanted to pick out because they were really inspiring and celebrated body confidence which I really enjoyed. I also like how the love triangle was put in the book. This is not a trope that I tend to enjoy however I liked the way it was done until the very end and I definitely liked how the love triangle turned out. The Verdict:Dumplin' is a great book that promotes loving yourself what even you look like and is definitely a great read. I know that it is only January but Dumplin' is a stand out book and will probably be one of my favourites of the year. ",en

531,18304322,1349817404,really liked it,"3.5-4 stars.This was super cute. Willowdean Dickson is my hero. She made the entire story.Set against the backdrop of small town Texas, Willowdean, daughter of a well-known pageant winner, is a fat teenager.And she does not care one bit.
But that's me. I'm fat. It's not a cuss word. It's not an insult. At least, it's not when I say it. So I always figure why not get it out of the way?
The way that she loves her body (though she is at times insecure) is something that every girl of every size should feel. 
I don't like to think of my hips as a nuisance, but more of an asset. I mean, if this were, like, 1642, my wide birthing hips would be worth many cows or something.
Though she is at times insecure about her body, she is totally and completely secure in who she is. 
I hate seeing fat girls on TV or in movies, because the only way the world seems to be okay with putting a fat person on camera is if they're miserable with themselves or if they're the jolly best friend. Well, I'm neither of those things.

All my life I've had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it's that if it's not your body, it's not your to comment on. Fat. Skinny. Short. Tall. it doesn't matter.
Not only does Willowdean send out a message to girls and women all over the world, she is also hilarious (at least, she made me laugh a lot):
If I could avert my eyes from all the kissing people ever, I'm positive that my life would be at least 2 percent more fulfilling
Also, Willowdean doesn't need a man:
You have got to be kidding me. News flash, Mom: a man will not cure my troubles.
And believe me, she has some mighty fine guys interested in her. I know this review turned out to be a love-fest of how much I love and respect Willowdean, but this story is really something that all girls and women should read. With so much advertising out there about body image, girls of every shape and size feel insecure in their own skin. And that is not right. Willowdean proves that you can love your body, even if society tells you it is not 'perfect' or 'beautiful'. I wish this message would get through to all women, including myself. We are much too hard on ourselves with regard to how we look, which often results in eating disorders and other drastic measures just to get that 'perfect body'. The message this book sends is: YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT THE WAY YOU ARE AND DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU OTHERWISE. Everyone should read it.I received an ARC from Edelweiss.

532,18304322,1704969991,really liked it,"Willowdean 'Dumplin' Dickson is a self-proclaimed fat girl and for the majority of her life she's been happy exactly the way she is. But one summer, Will ends up in a romantic englaement with Bo - a hot, athletic newcomer - and suddenly begins doubting herself. Dumplin decided to enter the town's beauty pageant to help boost her self-confidence and prove that fat girls can do it too.I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about this book so I really didn't know what to expect going into ti and I;m actually glad that this was the case as I think it helped me enjoy it a lot more. While there were definitely some aspects of Will that I didn't like and that annoyed me, overall I found the story sweet and enjoyable and I can why it was so easily picked up to become a film. Will is definitely great in her mindset, she knows she's fat and her best friend is thin but so what, that's just the way it is. She could definitely be quite judgey at times about other girls, fat or thin, but aren't we all sometimes? I also totally got the fear she felt the moment Bo touched her and became aware of her body cause I think no matter how skinny you are, when you're that adult moment when you're touched for the first time by someone yo're attracted to and you start feeling those feelings and thinking those thoughts, you suddenly become aware of your body as a whole and how it might appear to that person whose approval suddenly means the world. O think this came across really, really well for Will and it was a personal mountain she had to overcome in the book which I felt she eventually did (though I would have liked more aftermath at the end?)I was disappointed there wasn't more actual pageant stuff and that Will wasn't as into it as I thought. Being from a country where beauty pageant wasn't even a word until I started reading Meg Cabot and watching MTV, pageants just completely amuse and enthrall me. It's like a whole new world, I was hoping for a bookish Miss Congeniality but it failed me in this aspect. It was like the pageant was the afterthought when the book had been marketed with it as the main plot. I love how the other girls joined in though and how great they were and that they became friends.I though the crumpling relationship between El and Will was really interesting and I felt it was important. Friendships don't always last and people do become different and drift apart and I think it's important to convey this in books - that your childhood friend may not be your lifelong best friend. So to see how Will and El did become different people and how they struggled with this was good to read. And can we talk about how cute Bo is for a minute? When he called her Willowdean, I died. He was the only one that called her by her full name and when he introduced her to others he called her Will, because Willowdean was just for him and omg I just loved that!!!! ",en
533,18304322,1696525231,liked it,"Closer to 2.5 starsThis book was just okay. I guess I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I picked it up, but I didn't know much about this book going into it. I just saw it at the library and decided to give it a go because I needed an audiobook to listen to and this was the first thing I saw. This book follows Willowdean ""Dumplin'"", a self-proclaimed fat girl who decides to enter her town's beauty pageant. Even though this book isn't really about the pageant at all (except for the last 50 pages or so) but more so about Wilowdean's struggles with friendship and her love triangle romance.Let's start with some positives: I really enjoyed the southern atmosphere in this book. I loved the accent the narrator in the audiobook has. It made the book ten times more enjoyable, and honestly if the narrator didn't have such an awesome southern accent I might not have finished the book. Also, I did enjoy the pageant aspect of the story because I've never read a book specifically about a pageant before, and I used to be obsessed with Toddlers & Tiara's when I was in high school, it was my guilty pleasure. So I definitely enjoyed that part of the book even though I still don't think there was nearly enough of it. Another positive is that it's easy to read and easy to get into. I enjoyed her friendship with Ellen (before it got catty) and I liked that Willow encouraged her to be happy with her boyfriend and didn't slut shame her for having sex with her boyfriend. Now for the negatives: 1) The love triangle. It's no secret that I'm not a huge fan of love triangles and this one was no different. I didn't really care for Bo or Mitch and I didn't feel any chemistry between Willowdean and either guy, and I just didn't really like the romance in this book. 2)Also, this book drags, it's really long and not much happens. It reminds me of Sarah Dessen style writing where the writing is good, but I'm not excited to see what happens next and nothing really happens throughout the course of the book. 3) Willowdean can be a really judgmental, selfish character sometimes. The way she would treat her best friend Ellen and Bo, her love interest sometimes was annoying. Her negative outlook on certain things just really bothered me and it was like one minute she would be self confident and then the next she would act super self conscious and shut down. I hate the fact that she would constantly shoot Bo down just because she thinks they would get made fun of if they were together because he's a totally hot jock and she's just the ""fat girl"". I just don't get why she cares so much about what other people think.Overall, this book was just okay. At the end of the day it's forgettable and it didn't have much of an impact on me but it's still a decent book. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it though.",en
534,18304322,1386624547,,"Re-read in 2018-------------------I have to admit, I was pretty curious to see if Dumplin' by Julie Murphy would live up to all the hype that it has received so far. Seriously, I've heard nothing but great things about this book, and I was a little concerned that I wouldn't love it as much as everyone else seems to. I'm beyond thrilled to tell you that I was worried for nothing. This book was all kinds of awesome, and it definitely lives up to the hype!Willowdean Dickson, also known as Dumplin' by her mother, is a self-proclaimed fat girl. She's never been one to let her weight bother her, not until Bo, her co-worker and former basketball jock, starts to show interest in her. Instead of being flattered by Bo's attention, Will is instead starts to doubt herself, and Bo as well. In attempt to earn back her confidence, Will does something that no one expects, with the help of a few friends, and enters Miss Clover City beauty pageant. There she discovers things she never knew about herself.One of the things that I really loved about this book was how much I was able to relate to Willowdean. While I didn't have the issues she has while I was in high school, I have them now, and I have to say that most days I feel exactly the same way she felt when she starts having doubts about herself. But I absolutely love her confidence, and I wish I could have just an ounce of it for myself. I loved her will to overcome. She's seriously such an awesome character; she's definitely one of my new idols!I devoured this book in just a few hours time. I seriously did not want to put it down, and when I had to, I couldn't wait to get back to it. The storyline was addictive and kept me entertained throughout. I loved everything from the Dolly Parton addiction, to the beauty pageant escapades, and especially the romance and red suckers. This book has it all!Overall; Dumplin' is the second book by Julie Murphy that I've devoured and completely adored. I loved the storyline and the characters and every other single thing about this book. I really can't wait to see what Murphy comes up with in her next book, due out next year!

That’s how Dumplin’ by Julie Murphy was for me; by the third page, I knew this was going to be amazing.There are so many things to love about Dumplin’, but by far the best aspect to this story, and the reason I loved this book so much, is its main character, Willowdean. Willowdean is just so easy to relate to, even if your situations aren’t the same. Willowdean is confident and okay with her heavier body, but also she’s self-conscious about it, too. I so understand this.I sort of went into Dumplin’ thinking Willowdean was going to be this super strong, not caring what others think of her person, and she wasn’t exactly that, and I think that makes this book even better. Don’t get me wrong, because Willowdean is amazingly strong, but she also has doubts and insecurities and at times she wants to give up and that makes her so much more REAL! Willowdean struggles with her evolving friendship with Ellen, with boys, with the passing of her aunt, and with her relationship with her mother. She doesn’t always handle things perfectly but she learns and grows and that is the best kind of character.Dumplin’ is also just full of other amazingly well developed characters. All the characters are well-developed and very complicated, just like real people. Sometimes people would make me so mad (Ellen, Hannah, Bo, Willowdean’s mother), but then before you know it, I wanted to give them big hugs and invite them over for a sleepover. Again, it’s just so real.I just cannot say enough good things about Dumplin'. It made me feel things. So many things! I was swoony, and angry, and teary-eyed, and forgiving and happy. If you haven’t read Dumplin’ yet, get yourself a copy right away. You will not be disappointed.This review was originally posted on Quinn's Book Nook",en

If you read my review of Through the Zombiemirror by Gena Showalter, you will know that I hate those books with a perfect human (always muscled) god, a.k.a. the boyfriend the main (female) character. I mean, everyone is talking about that we don't accept the female ideal of beauty, but apparently that doesn't count for male people. It's just not realistic and I get so tired and bored. This may contain spoilers but please guys don't read this book it's so bad. I thought this would be different. The main point of the book seemed that however big or skinny or whatever you are, you should be accepted as who you are, something I totally support. The main character is an overweight girl who wants to be accepted in her community. But well... guess who she gets in a relationship with: the most beautiful boy in town. Well, they break up after some time and she gets a relationship with another, also somewhat obese guy, but guess what: they break up too and she goes back to the hot guy and happily ever after (i dont really know because I quit 70 pages before the end and threw the book away) LIKE, SERIOUSLY? I love that Julie Murphy wants to write a book against people's prejudiced opinion concerning obesity. But she herself is too indoctrinated with this to really let the idea go, because she continues clinging to the idea that the main female character should get a relationship with the hottest guy and DAMN IT THIS IS BULLSHIT.

I really enjoyed the idea and message behind it all and I liked how Julie Murphy never really came straight out and said the weight or size of the main character. I read a blog post by her and she was saying how it isn't her place to categorize what is fat and what is not, which I really liked. I liked that we knew that Willowdean was fat and that was the end of it. It wasn't a huge deal, just something that was normal.Although I really enjoyed the message, the plot sort of dragged and the whole pageant surrounding this book dragged out so long that it only took place in the last 20 pages. The ending irritated me but I did hear that we are getting some sort of sequel or companion so I may try that out. I just wished tat the plot would have been more fleshed out and that it didn't drag on as long. Also, the book was pretty predictable so I was never really fully invested in the story and what was happening.I wish I would have liked this one more.

Willowdean loves to eat and as someone how's always had a problem staying away from snacks, I relate to her a lot. No matter if you are overweight, have a big butt, skinny, have problematic skin or something else, we all have things we don't like about ourselves. Even though Will is aware of the way she looks, she doesn't let that bring her down. She embraces it and stands up to bullies. Her biggest problem was letting the hot guy, Bo, who is interested in her, touch her. Despite accepting herself, she gets insecure whenever she's close to him because she can't even imagine him being into her was a possibility.

Lucy was always mentioned by Will as a second parent and someone she deeply looked up to. She was Will's inspiration for a lot of the decisions she made in the book.

""I've wasted a lot of time in my life. I've thought too much about what people will say or what they're gonna think. And sometimes it's over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn't good enough. But you don't have to bother with that nonsense. I wasted all that time so you don't have to. If you go in there and you decide that this isn't for you, then you never have to go back. But you owe yourself the chance, you hear me?""

Will is a lot of things - headstrong, smart, and brave. She's in her right mind. She knows her body's not typical nor aesthetically pleasing to most people but she also knows that these thoughts are too superficial to give a damn about. Yet sometimes she does give a damn about it, as in this instance during summer vacation when El and Will went to the pool:

""Maybe I'm making a bigger deal of this than it is. Maybe it's the type of thing only I noticed. Like, how when you have a pimple and you think it's the only thing anyone else sees when they see you.But then there was the way Callie looked me up and down. Like I was some kind of abomination. The truth is that I'm mad I felt uncomfortable to begin with, because why should I? Why should I feel bad about wanting to get into a pool or standing around in my swimsuit? Why should I feel like I need to run in and out of the water so that no one has to see the atrocity that are my thighs?""

It doesn't make her a hypocrite; only human. Sometimes it gets very difficult to not be conscious about the parts of our body we hate most, especially when people pointedly go out of their way to comment on them (subtly or unsubtly).The middle of the story has an aching sadness to it. Especially on Will and Bo's relationship.
""But there's a reason why Bo didn't tell me he was changing schools. There has to be. And even if there's not, he and I have to be done because I can't let this bleed over into real life. I won't be ridiculed. I won't be one-half of the couple who everyone stares at and asks, How did she get him?
Nobody should ever feel this way! Will knows she and Bo had something special, but the first time she felt their relationship going downhill, she immediately blamed it on her appearance. It's unfair and really, really sad. *sighsEllen, on the other hand... I have mixed feelings for her. She's pretty cool, always knowing the right thing to say, however blunt and rude. Sometimes, though, she can be really oblivious and discompassionate and bitchy.THE ROMANCE

""But he smiles, and it's hard not to feel like I've swallowed a handful of rocks. I don't get why we call it a crush when it feels more like a curse.

Dumplin' is not about the romance as much as it is about the pageant. But I loved the scenes nevertheless, straightforwardly written and simple. I also love how that first kiss scene was written - as fast as it must have felt for Will.However, I don't know what to feel about Mitch getting in the picture. I liked him and I kept cursing Bo because it felt like he wasn't doing anything. Plus, I practically went ballistic when Bekah asked Bo to this dance with his name on her butt cheeks.THE DIALOGUEThe little details Julie Murphy injects in her dialogue - Bo coughing in his fist before saying yeah, rubbing his knuckles across his chin, brushing his thumb along his lower lip, etc... the ordinariness of them give life to lines.And the characters have the most perfect responses!

""I don't know."" Bo's voice is a quiet rumble. ""My mom died. Five years ago. And I guess I like to think that wherever she is, her sky has meteor showers, too."" Each word is a naked patch of him, and I want so badly to add up all the bread crumbs I have and make sense of him.I wait for some kind of disclaimer from him about his theory being dumb or that he's sorry for being a downer. Because that's what I would say. But there's no apology from Bo. And I like that. I like that he has nothing to be sorry for. I want to tell him that I feel bad about his mom or that I like thinking of Lucy that way, too, but instead I say, ""I guess it's an awfully big sky not to share.""

Ain't it so touching? *sniffs*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*I think I would have given this book five stars. Buuut...I believe the pageant was the ultimate element of the novel. I mean look at the cover! But the pageant narration fell short for me. The chapters near the end missed really important details, and I expected said chapters to be a glorious revolution, with these four unlikely females joining and they would make a change. At least reveal the interview questions and tell us what Hannah's answer was that got the audience thinking. Or at least tell us the winner (and its implications).",en

And sometimes it's over silly things like going to the grocery store or going to the post office. But there have been times when I really stopped myself from doing something special. All because I was scared someone might look at me and decide I wasn't good enough. But you don't have to bother with that nonsense. I wasted all that time so you don't have to.” GOD DAMN I LOVE THIS BOOK.I think ever teenager who is coming of age or in high school in their teens needs to read this book.Because I think every single person one earth face these problems.And I think during the age of teenagers is where it hits the hardest because we care so much to impress other people and to fit in.Despite whatever size you are, everyone has their own insecurities. Sometimes we don't see it. Sometimes some people hide it better than others. But that doesn't make it okay. We shouldn't be define by what we look like. We too shouldn't judge everyone by how they look. Because everyone has their own insecurities, everyone has their own problems that we do not know of. Be kind to everyone always. Treat people like how you want people to treat you.I love Willowdean. She is so sassy, funny and if she don't know it, she actually has good confidence than she thought she has.She may be only thinking of how she look like in some days, but little does she knows in some ways she has so much confidence.She manage to stand up for herself with Patrick. She herself walk to register for the pageant. She is not afraid to ask for help. She is there for her squad. She might not see those as confidence, but those little things makes so much than she think. I love her and El's friendship.I love how Julie tells a story of an inperfection friendship because its true.We fight with our bestfriends, we grow as different people and sometimes fates decides if the friendship should continue or not.She also shows a different insecure side of a girl like El's who other people might see as beautiful but don't see her struggle of how she tries to not be herself so she could fit in with people like Callie and where she works.Which is sad but it's reality.I think there comes a point in our life where we will soon realise how very childish are those things. We will outgrow of that stage and be able to accept ourselves and the people around us who are willing to be friends without any care of how we look.And I hope everyone finds that at some point in their life.We can't be really good friends with everyone, and that's okay. I love her squad so much. I am glad she made friends of her own. Her own squad where is inspiring one another.OMG JULIE IS KILLING ME WITH ALL THE BOY CHARACTERS.I love Mitch. He is a dream and a sweetheart.I love his friendship with Willowdean. It's so genuine and sweet and he really would have treat Willowdean like a Queen.My heart breaks for him in the story. He deserve a hug.And omg Bo, What a cutie he is. I like how he doesn't force Willowdean to talk about her insecurities when he knows she has. He just treat her like how he wants to treat her, all nice and lovey sincerely. Because he knows those insecurities won't stop how he feels towards her. Only when Willowdean mention of how she is afraid of how others sees them then he let her know how beautiful she is.I think it takes both ways to put those fire insecurities to rest.Bo has his side to accept Willowdean and tell her she is beautiful but it is also Willowdean's effort of accepting herself can change that.I love the ending. It's completely satisfying for me.It's a new beginning for Willowdean, She has walk a challenge she has overcome and she has so much more to overcome with a different confidence level she is at.And the ending shows, you don't get results straight away in wanting change, but those results for her squad, it shows that change is happening and will happen and they just don't stop demanding it and putting action towards it.“it’s this reminder that no matter who you are, there will always be someone prettier or smarter or thinner.

556,18304322,2481234456,liked it,"4.5 starsOk, look. I had ZERO expectations about this book, because why would I? It's set in Texas and centers around a self-proclaimed fat girl and Dolly Parton enthusiast who enters a teen beauty pageant. On the list of things that I have no clue about or any interest in, beauty pageants, Dolly Parton and Texan beauty queens all rank pretty high.I still don't really know what made me pick this up (though I'm pretty sure it was the cover, because have you even seen that magnificent thing???), but I'm so glad that I did!Our main character Willowdean Dickson or Dumplin', as she's called by her former beauty queen mom, is a sight to behold. She is bold and brave, and at the same time insecure and so deeply human.She makes mistakes and she acts out, she can be a bitch and she can be self centered, but what teenager isn't guilty of those things at some point or the other?She is also determined and compassionate and a great friend, and I love that girl to bits and want to give her a hug and an endless supply of cookies.“This is me. Back me up or back the fuck out.”Yasss Queen!I mean, how awesome is this girl?? I loved her attitude and how unapologetic she was about who she is. Of course she also felt insecure and had bad moments of self doubt, but hearing her voice from the page was such a positivity boost.The best thing about this book for me is the wonderful message of inclusivity, body positivity and female friendship.It really isn't about a pageant at all, it's about a circle of friends being there for each other, learning to embrace themselves and accept who they are, and most of all, having a whole lot of fun while they're at it.There are drag queens, Dolly Parton impersonators, beauty queens, budding romances, and SO MUCH teen girl drama.I loved it.It is the book that I never knew that I needed in my life and it brought a big goofy grin on my face as I was reading it, and I hugged it to my chest when I finished reading it. And if that doesn't mean a new favorite YA, then I don't know what does.“All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on.”",en

For most book/movies, I will speed read the book before even attempting the movie. But it was a stay-in-bed and veg weekend this past weekend so I watched Dumplin' on Netflix, and IT WAS AMAZING. I love Dolly! I love Willowdean! I love drag queens who sing Jolene!I was so sad when it ended. I needed more Dumplin' so I pulled this out of my TBR pile and moved it to the top, and in an even stranger turn of events, I'm going to say I liked the movie better. Just hear me out. The book is amazingly well-written with such clever lines. I highlighted sixteen sentiments that were so poignant and perfect, and as someone who constantly battles with weight it was so nice to see a big girl who didn't have to lose weight to succeed.But while Willowdean touts herself as someone who is comfortable in her own skin, she doesn't show that as much in the book. She comes across as insecure and prejudiced against thin people, always assuming they're judging her on her weight even if they're not. I think the movie did a better job of handling that without making Will come off as a brat.And Bo....Bo is kind of a dick in the book. He's hooking up with Will in an abandoned parking lot, keeping her secret, and she's still moon-eyed over him. He's much more swoon-worthy in the movie.There's also love triangle that was thankfully edited out of the movie. I wish we could edit them out of YA for all eternity, because as I've said before it just makes your MC look bad. Willowdean is totally leading Mitch on, even though she has no interest in him. She's basically using him as vengeance.Not cool, Willowdean. Not cool.That being said, the book is mostly centered around boys. The movie focuses more on the female relationships with Willow's Aunt Lucy, her mom and El, and I preferred that take on it, apart from the Hannah/Amanda whitewash combo they used in the movie.Not cool, Netflix.

Willowdean is a fat girl and perfectly fine with that, thank you very much. She doesn't see ""fat"" as a negative word, just a descriptor like ""tall"" and ""brown-haired."" But the summer she starts working at Harpy's makes her incredibly self-aware of her size, because now hot boy Bo has his eyes set on her. It's obvious why she likes him, but she can't help but wonder what he sees in her. Her confidence declines, her beautiful best friend Ellen fades away from her life, and Will misses her aunt so much it hurts. So she decides to do the one thing that would shock her beauty-queen mother most: enter the Miss Clover City beauty pageant along with several other outcast girls. Nowhere on the application does it say ""fat, crippled, and buck-teeth girls need not apply,"" and every girl deserves a chance at a pageant. Navigating, friendship, body talks, grief, confidence, Dolly Parton songs, and strutting with drag queens, Will's life turns upside down and back on track as she embraces her strengths.Rarely do I read a book that I connect with on so many levels and yet be completely disconnected from as well. I'm not a big girl by any means. In fact, I'm a little underweight for my height and age. That doesn't mean I don't understand body shaming. At the same time, I couldn't help but think of my gorgeous, talented, hilarious, intelligent, active friend...who also happens to be a big girl. She's got the perfect fat girl figure, and I'm so jealous of that -- because she owns it, she's confident, and she very much reminds me of Willowdean. Sometimes she wonders what men see in her, and I can't help but give her this look like, ""Honey? Seriously?""Will's dilemma throughout the book isn't that she's fat, not really. She doesn't hate her body, and she's not unhealthy. She's living life like every other teen girl: she's good in school, she's got a job, and she's obsessed with Dolly Parton. It's the other factors in her life that make her wonder how to navigate being fat. It never occurred to her that a gorgeous former jock (whose jaw can cut glass) would like her, and when he does she's both thrilled and disgusted (because if he likes her, he'll want to kiss her, and then touch her, and hold her hand, and the thought of the two of them touching and holding hands freaks her out because look at him and then look at her and how does a guy like him get a girl like her -- you see where this distructive thought process comes in?).It also never hit her till she signed up for the pageant that all the beauty queens were tall and thin and Western definition of beauty. But the application doesn't say a girl of a certain height and weight and bone structure can't join the pageant. So she signs up -- and her mother, who runs the event, nearly tells her not to. Will calls her out on it, saying if her own mother and pageant judge says she can't sign up, then she's also saying her daughter isn't good enough and beautiful enough.By fighting the stigma, Will grows more confident in her skin. Watching this blossom throughout the book is so incredibly heartwarming, it makes me want to hug her and strut a runway alongside her. It's no wonder Bo's in love with her, or why Ellen depends on her so much. As a reader, you can see why people like Will, even if she doesn't see it herself. It's never about her body to the outsider (how many times did Bo say this to her? A million? And how many times did I fall in love with him? A million and one?), but she makes it about her body. Joining her on this journey of body acceptance and body confidence was encouraging, uplifting, and so universal to every girl of every size.Positive. Hilarious. Sweet. Sassy. Deep.This book is like a cool glass of sweet tea on a hot Texas summer evening. It's refreshing and perfect and just what you didn't know you needed.",en

It makes you want to chase your dreams and helps you realise that you should love you and be 100% happy with who you are.A huge thank you to Penguin Teen Australia for my ARC copy, I’m pretty sure you have changed my whole perspective on “being the person you want to be” by giving me this book.Willowdean is an amazing confident character and like many, if not all of us, we have doubts about certain parts of ourselves, whether that be our physical features or personality.I loved the Beauty Pageant aspect to the story line and Willowdean’s growing relationship with Bo is inspiring. You watch her grow within herself and reach new goals and ultimately become the girl who doesn’t care what others think and encourages those around her.This book is about acceptance, it’s about building people up and not tearing them down and, in the end, you realise your dreams aren’t dreams, they are a possibility.“There’s something about swimsuits that make you think you’ve got to earn the right to wear them. And that’s wrong. Really, the criteria is simple. Do you have a body? Put a swimsuit on it.”I feel as though this applies to everything, there is no reason you can’t do anything if you put your mind to it.I just can’t get over how amazing this book is, I’m not a huge Dolly Parton fan but this would be because I haven’t really been introduced to her. However, everyone knows the song Jolene and this is pretty much all you really need to learn to enjoy this book.One part that completely resonated with me is the friendship between Willowdean and Ellen, which reminded me of my friendship with my Best Friend. No matter the disagreements or arguments, at the end of the day we are there for each other, we have been through so much and just like Willowdean and Ellen – they support each other no matter the circumstances.

Things seem okay for her.Although, things start to change when a certain guy takes an interest in her?Can someone like her, a plus sized girl fall in love with a buff handsome guy without being ridiculed?Dumplin' was literally a breath of fresh air. Not only with the characters, but because this book has such a great message. At one point in our lives, we look in the mirror and point out our flaws. Mostly, people worry about their weight. For me, personally, I like the way I am. I'm not buff nor am I skinny. I do have a bit of a belly, but mainly because I choose to eat a lot of junk food. I mean, sure I could shed a few pounds, but overall, my body is fine.With Willow however, she begins to have doubts about herself. Why should people have to judge her just because she is bigger than most girls? What gives them the right to do it and make fun of her? People can be assholes. But instead of letting the bullies win, she decides to enter a beauty pageant contest. Because fuck what most people have to say about her.As a character, Willow is flawed in the way that you understand her problems. I did have a problem with her at one point in the book, but later as I kept reading, I begin to sort of understand why she did it. By no means is she a perfect character. It's her imperfections that make her unique and stand out.I enjoyed Dumplin' for having such a great message. Julie Murphy is starting to become a good author to read. Her debut novel, Side Effects May Vary, was a good debut and Dumplin' is a great! I can't wait to see what else she has to write.Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar",en

But as a girl, I understand what it's like to hate myself, to hate my body, to be afraid to gain weight, and to avoid using the word 'fat' like it's a curse worse. Except it isn't. Fat is not bad word. It's not an insult. It's not something to be ashamed of and too often in our society that it's exactly what it means.Dumplin is a novel about Willowdean's growth as a person, as a girl, towards acceptance of her fatness. I don't think many skinny privileged people will understand her journey fully, but it helps me understand my skinny privilege better. I had a fat friend in college who I thought of as my soulmate. We were so alike and so compatible that I thought we'd never grow apart. But one time when we had a fight, she told me I made her feel bad just by being skinny. I did not understand what she meant as her weight never once entered discussion or something I ever commented on. I knew she was super self-conscious in her choice of dress and what she ate, but I felt like I never judged her on it. But I think, I'm starting to understand her a little thanks to this book.I liked all the characters, I loved Willowdean's sass and her wavering self-confidence. I loved how she stood up for herself. Although I really wish she cut El loose - who I think is just an awful friend. I don't think she understood exactly how she hurt Willowdean or just how big of a bitch she was being. But she was way too insensitive for a best friend. I liked Bo and I liked Mitch, although I felt there was a little too much boy drama, I mean the pageant is almost like an afterthought. Although it's very refreshing to have to handsome boys competing for a fat girl for a chance.Overall, I think this is a wonderful novel with an awesome message, but I wanted something a little more.

I was very disappointed. this book was supposed to be about positive body image and I thought it was going to be a feel good book about loving yourself and being happy with how you look and instead it was just a shitty YA ""romance."" ps.

Willowdean ""Dumplin'"" Dixon couldn't care less about her size though, and is happy just the way she is, until the time comes when she meets a guy and wants to prove to the world that size doesn't matter. She enters a beauty contest, which continues as the book goes on.This book looks to have taken a whole new approach to the YA romance genre, but in fact a strangely-similar story was done in the 1980's in the form of a corny TV film from Toronto called Babycakes.  Also, although Willowdean preaches that a person's body size shouldn't matter, she calls thin people ""twiggy"" and ""fake"", and Millie, who is obese, apparently shouldn't have good self-esteem about it. Aside from that, Dumplin' is a pretty good book and it has a lot of humor but also a lot to say about our society's view on being overweight.",en

I loved her confidence I wished I had that then. I have it now. I felt so sad for how their mother-daughter relationship went and hope that in the end, her mother sees what a beautiful child she has. Looks past what she sees. The boys in this book awe. I just want to bless their hearts the, they both see past what they see to who Willowdean is. I loved this so hard. I just enjoyed this book.

580,18304322,2442064543,liked it,"Tenía muchas ganas de leer este libro porque parte de una premisa que me parece muy interesante y necesaria. La protagonista es gorda, y eso se sale de los cánones típicos de los personajes en literatura juvenil. Pero además es un libro que se centra en cómo ella intenta aceptarse, como su peso afecta a su vida, a su autoestima y a su relación con los demás debido a lo que dicta la sociedad en lo referente a cómo debe ser el cuerpo, especialmente cómo debe ser el cuerpo de una mujer.Y además de todo esto se introduce un concurso de belleza gracias al cual se intensifica todos estos temas y se ve como siempre se excluyen a aquellas adolescentes que no entran en lo marcado, por lo que debido a ciertas cirscunstancias, cuando Dumplin decide apuntarse algunas de sus compañeras también lo hacen.Es un libro que empezó muy bien, los personajes están bastante bien trabajados y la relación de Dumplin con su madre es tensa porque esta señora es quien organiza el sorteo y parece que el peso de su hija le molesta bastante. Es horrible, pero ya he visto en mi círculo de conocidos varios casos en los que ocurre esto y creo que crecer con una madre que no te acepta tal y como eres y a la que le preocupa que bajes de peso por razones de físico y no de salud tiene que ser horrible para la autoconfianza de uno mismo y Dumplin así lo demuestra.Tengamos sobrepeso o no creo que cualquiera puede identificarse con ella y con las otras chicas porque todos tenemos algún defecto y es fácil que hayamos vivido aunque sea en algún momento lo que supone tener un complejo, ponerse un bañador, ver las miradas de los demás, vivir o presenciar burlas en el instituto... Así que me ha gustado que se mostrase eso y cómo aprende a superarlo la gente, pero también cómo en cierto momento muchas de las chicas que se supone que no tienen problemas empatizan con las ""gordas"" del concurso, ya que al final todos somos iguales, aunque a veces nos empecinemos en que no es así. Todos tenemos sentimientos.Sin embargo, no todo ha sido bueno y es que en parte me ha decepcionado bastante. Esperaba más, lo reconozco. La relación amorosa no me ha gustado lo más mínimo, creo que ya es un cliché eso de que la chica gorda o la chica fea mira por donde se lleva al bombón de turno... En este caso es un chico guapo al que no entiendo lo más mínimo, no he visto su personalidad, no me ha dicho nada, no me ha gustado y no me ha convencido su relación con Dumplin, que no me ha parecido nada romántica. No entiendo qué le ve, me ha faltado que la autora expliase mejor por qué ella está enamorada de él más allá de porque es guapo y le hace caso, o porque ha sido su amor platónico. Me parece extraño que se trabaje más su amistad con Mith, que en este caso sería el otro de un mini triángulo amoroso, y este personaje me parece que la ha tratado mucho mejor que el otro... Si es todavía no entiendo por qué perdona al otro tío, ni porqué lo quiere... Y diría que ya que estamos en su punto de vista, guste más o guste menos eso debería tener algún tipo de explicación.Por otra parte, también creo que aunque se tocan temas muy interesantes relacionados con el bullying y los complejos no se llega a profundizar en nada, los personajes secundarios no se conocen mucho más y creo que el grupo de chicas del que se hace amiga Dumplin sería muy interesante de conocer. Su amistad y enfado con su mejor amiga también me ha dejado un poco confusa...En definitiva, me ha gustado, la lectura es amena, trata temas importantes pero en varios aspectos se me ha quedado un poco floja esta lectura, un poco superficial, así que eso me hace tener una sensación un poco agridulce.",es

But I ended up picking up Dumplin' from my English classroom's library as a quick read for my family's camping weekend, and I'm glad I did. It's one of those books that you don't have to really think intensely about as you read, which can be really, really nice. It feels a bit like a beach read, almost, as I suppose many contemporary books do. It made me very, very, briefly excited for summer. Which, if you know me... is a feat. Willowdean Dickson, the protagonist of this novel, is a self-proclaimed fat girl who works at a fast-food restaurant called Harpy's, loves Dolly Parton, and enters a beauty pageant. There's friendship drama, and relationship drama, and relatability in store for anyone who's been insecure about their body, I feel like. That being said, I feel like some drama was a liiiitle bit over the top, and there were points when Willowdean herself was judgemental to the point where I kind of wondered what was going on almost? Like because I figured the book would be more about lifting up yourself and others, almost. I dunno. But the writing style was very easy to read and compelling, the characters memorable (although the love triangle...), and it gave a very Southern vibe. I've never been to Texas (or anywhere south, really) but that's just the kind of air about it I was getting.I liked this book and the cover and had a fun time reading it! I might even reread it someday on like, a beach trip or something. Also, one last note: I'd like to apologize to the spider I accidently killed between the final pages of this book. I swear I didn't see you there and that your squishing was a total accident. I also apologize to my English teacher and to the next student to read this copy, because I'm sure neither of you will be particularly pleased with the spider carcass you find. Sorry bout it. ",en

I wasted all that time so you don’t have to.” - page 25 of Dumplin’I’ve never been skinny and I will most likely never will. It’s not for a lack of trying though. I remember trying Slim-Fast before I was even ten years old and doing Barbie workout videos. Throughout the years the scale has gone up and it’s gone down, my confidence has too. Whenever I come across a book with a plus size character I’m always skeptical. How will they be portrayed? As a villain? As a slob? As a crazy cat lady? As the depressed girl who can only find happiness and love if she drops a hundred pounds? Those books don’t feel so good to read and often leave readers feeling worse about themselves. Going into Dumplin’ I was a little apprehensive and a little scared with how this could turn out. Would I be able relate to Will or would this be another misrepresentation for the community?Dumplin’ was a really good book. It’s about a sixteen year old girl named Willowdean who is in search to find her confidence again. Now, a lot people feel that Will didn’t have any confidence to begin with but I feel like anyone who goes to a public pool in a swim suit and has body image issues is incredibly brave and courageous. A lot of people don’t have the confidence or fearlessness to do that. To me, Will was confident in herself even in the beginning of the book. She knew who she was but as time goes on she feels less and less secure about herself and her body. This story isn’t about losing weight, or doing drastic things to change yourself to be likeable. This story is about Will trying to find who she is and be okay with it.What I loved about this book, besides it’s message, was the dialogue; it was witty and refreshing. There were so many lines that I found inspiring and I’ll share them down below! Please if you read anything in this review go read those quotes! It was great to see a “fat” girl find happiness without losing a single pound or losing herself. I also enjoyed the romance in the story; it was very cute and reminded me a little bit of my favorite show, My Mad Fat Diary. Overall I thought the book was pretty good. There were a few situations that I felt were… not realistic but I get why they were written into the book. Another “issue” I had with Dumplin’ was how some chapters ended so abruptly. This left parts of the story feeling unfinished. However, I believe the message of this story is worth more than anything else! I highly, highly encourage you to check out some of the below quotes from Dumplin’!Quotes from Dumplin’:Quotes in italic are my favorites.“I mean, if this were, like, 1642, my wide birthing hips would be worth many cows or something.” - pg 11“I’ve wasted a lot of time in my life.

586,18304322,2535710103,liked it,"2.5 / 3 starsSo I’m going to start this review by saying that I did enjoy reading the book and to got me out of my reading slump that I was in. Whilst it was enjoyable, I also hated the main character as she was so problematic. I think that Julie Murphy was writing Willowdean to be relatable to plus size girls (of which I am), however she really missed the mark as Willowdean came off as hateful and so self pitying that it genuinely made me roll my eyes every time she spoke to others. Usually I can get past an unlikable character if they develop or it is pertinent to the plot, but after the first half of the book, Willowdean wasn’t developing and just came off as annoying. I’m going to go into more detail about this with quotes (!!!!!!!) below because I need to make this cohesive and to pinpoint my specific thoughts in certain paragraphs lol. Just a warning that this is critical and a bit ranty so like don’t hate me. It’s also very long.Plot-Set in Clover City in the south of North America, Willowdean a ‘self-proclaimed fat girl’ enrols into her mother’s Miss Teen Blue Bonnet beauty pageant as a massive fuck you to her mum who she thinks wishes Willowdean wasn’t her daughter because she’s fat and not the traditional beauty queen looking girl like she is. They say it’s to take back her confidence but she does it out of resentment for traditionally pretty girls. She’s also navigating a ‘relationship’ (you can’t even call it that to be honest) with fitty basketball player Bo who goes to a private school. And thus is my plot summary for this story.So this is marketed as being about a fat girl who joins a pageant and I was so excited to read about that and was waiting eagerly for when parts of the pageant would show up. This could have been such a good look at pageant culture and, considering it’s about loving your body and yourself, could have been about girl power and women respecting and appreciating each other but no, it wasn’t. It was a revenge plot which eventually developed into Willowdean trying to take part in the pageant after realising that ‘oh shit, I’ve paid $200 to enter and don’t want to make myself look like a tit and I don’t want to embarrass my mum who I realise now loves me as a daughter and doesn’t resent me for being fat’. She also does the pageant to get over her grief over losing her aunt Lucy and to do something that her aunt never had the courage to do, but she was more focused on revenge than actually competing and making her aunt proud. For being marketed as the story revolving around her joining a pageant only about 70 pages in total were about the pageant (don’t quote me on that because I didn’t actually count the pages) and the rest was Willowdean putting down herself and the others around her. I was disappointed about this because imagine how great it could have been to have a montage of pageant prep throughout the book and delving in to how she prepped and how she felt about that like finding a dress or planning her makeup and hair and the struggles of preparing for such a big event.Willowdean Dixon (The good, the bad and the ugly) -The good - It was good that Willowdean, whilst being presented as confident was also vulnerable when with her own thoughts. I also liked that she described herself as fat, ‘I’m fat. It’s not a cuss word. It’s not an insult.’ (Pg.9), as I find that whenever I use the word fat people are straight there telling me no I’m not and I realise that I am and it’s not an awful word, it’s an adjective like every other describing word so why not reclaim it? I also liked the positive talk surrounding sex and that it shouldn’t be treated as some momentous occasion when you lose your virginity, ‘having sex doesn’t make you a woman. [...]. If you want sex, have sex, but don’t make it this huge thing that carries all this weight.’ (Pg. 17) I think that this is great as I’m sure a lot of (younger) teenagers are reading this and this needs to be shown that there shouldn’t be any stigma around talking about sex and it isn’t a big thing. It shows that you’re a woman by being born a woman (or transitioning) and sex doesn’t take you from girlhood to womanhood. I also like that Willowdean is scared of being seen as childish by her friends for not being experienced as I’m sure many women and girls have been fearful about too when their friends are living through life quicker than them. There is also a great quote that Willowdean says which is ‘Perfection is nothing more than a phantom shadow we’re all chasing’ (pg. 212) which I think is extremely relevant in society now, especially in the technological age where you can so easily access so many people who present themselves as perfect. The bad and the ugly- Willowdean is mean and a bully. She’s vile to other people and her thoughts are so toxic. Take this quote on page 5 (PAGE 5 SO EARLY ON IN THE BOOK), ‘Millie is that girl, the one I am ashamed to admit that I’ve spent my whole life looking and thinking, Things could be worse. I’m fat, but Millie’s the type of fat that requires elastic waist pants because they don’t make pants with buttons and zips in her size. Her eyes are too close together and her nose pinches up at the end. She wears shirts with puppies and kittens and not in an ironic way.’ This poor girl who she has never really spoke to before is getting shamed by Willowdean for being fat when Willowdean is fat herself. Willowdean also loves to comment on things that can’t be changed such as Millie’s pinched nose and eyes which is awful. Millie can’t help her face yet Willowdean is commenting on her features when Willowdean worries about people even thinking negative thoughts about her body and features, which is really hypocritical. The thought ‘I know that fat girls are supposed to be allergic to pools or whatever, but I love swimming.’ (Pg. 27) makes Willowdean seem like some magic fat girl and she’s quirky and confident for swimming, but I know plenty of bigger girls who love the swim. When I read this I was so confused about this quote and it made me think should I be scared to swim because I’m fat? I think that if you’re suffering with body issues this book isn’t for you as it plants little seeds of doubt about your body into your mind when you’ve never otherwise thought about the points she brings up.Willowdean also says that ‘I wish there was a way for me to tell her all the ways she makes her life harder than it needs to be without me coming off as a bitch’ (pg. 39) as if she’s all high and mighty with fashion and doesn’t think that maybe certain individuals have their own sense of style and no there is no way to come across as not a bitch because if you criticise someone for wearing something that makes them feel confident then yes, you are a bitch. The bitchiest of bitches.The quote that really grinds my gears was ‘My scientific opinion: This Place is a shithole and all the girls who work here are vapid skanks [...]’ (Pg. 81) it is already told to us that the shop that her best friend works at only sells clothes up to a size 12 which is shit and I agree, but Willowdean stereotypes all of the girls who work there as being ‘skanks’ (that is an awful word) and basically slut shames these girls and her best friend as she uses the word ‘all’ which shows her resentment for thin girls and her best friend. This segues perfectly into the fact that Willowdean is a shitty friend and potential love interest. Willowdean walks around thinking that she deserves everything in the world as shown when El tells her that she is competing in the beauty pageant (I didn’t get a quote so I’m going to paraphrase) and Willowdean says something along the lines that she deserves to compete and El doesn’t because El is the typical looking pageant girl and it’s unfair that El is taking something again from Willowdean. After El supports her and, let’s be real, gets dragged down by Willowdean, Willowdean still doesn’t think she’s in the wrong. And then takes the entirety of the book to apologise saying that she’s ‘too late’ and it’s been too long for her to apologise and then she treats her new friends like crap. She’s also an awful love interest. Again, she’s a massive hypocrite with Bo. When they start their relationship they keep it a secret with neither telling anyone about it. It’s not even a proper relationship, the basically just kiss at the back of the fast food restaurant where they work, Harpy’s. Willowdean then proceeds to dump the angel that is Bo because he didn’t tell her he was moving to her school and didn’t tell anyone that they were sort of together, when Willowdean didn’t even tell her best friend who she has never kept a secret from (!) and proceeds to do this independent woman speech about Bo keeping her a secret which them makes him feel like he’s in the wrong when they were just as bad as each other. Bo is the latest draft into the ‘These Fictional Boys Deserve Better’ club that me and @Noa have created. Bo is this sweet southern boy who is trying his best to adjust to his new school and being a better person and he deserves better. Say it with me BO LARSON DESERVES BETTER. He has stuffed toys in his room and he says stuff like ‘I want more with you. I want to hold hands in public. I want to drive you home from work and give you a kiss goodnight. And talk on the phone so late I fall asleep’. He also understands consent and apologises when he losses Willowdean saying ‘I shouldn’t have kissed you like that. Without asking.’ And Willowdean who professes her love in her mind for him then proceeds to tell him that they can’t be together because she’s scared of what other people will think and that she wishes that they could be together ‘and no one has to know’ WHICH IS THE REASON SHE DUMPED HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. Honestly she needs to get her priorities straight. If girls handle their romantic encounters how Willowdean does then there’s going to be so many unhealthy relationships out in the open and that makes me so sad. From someone who has been promoting being open about sex and relationships early on to then messing around a boy she is in love with then Christ on a bike and the mother Mary she’s done a 180 gone in the complete opposite direction to where she was originally headed. There’s also a line I want to mention too where she says ‘I get that you’re trying to be nice, but I don’t think it’s fair to say you actually know what it feels like to be broke’ and then says about how she doesn’t understand why he didn’t tell her about getting into his private school via a scholarship and that is why Willowdean, because you assume everything and try to make every situation about you into a boohoo situation as if nothing should be worse for you. Of course I know these aren’t real characters but I just wanted to note down my annoyance throughout this book.If you’ve finished reading this rant then you deserve a cup of tea and a biscuit for getting through it. Honestly I didn’t think it would be this long, but my emotions overcame me with this one ?. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my hastily put together thoughts. Seriously though I did enjoy reading this, but there were some really problematic parts in this that even I noticed and usually I’m oblivious. So I can’t give this more than a 2.5 / 3 stars overall regardless of how much I enjoyed reading it. ",en
587,18304322,961605376,it was amazing,"Disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book through a book trading program.This entire review can also be found on my blog, The Hardcover Lover. Please consider visiting my blog if you like this review.Finding a book like Dumplin' by Julie Murphy is as rare as finding a sunflower in the desert. Why? Because books like this aren't being written. But they should be. It's not every day that you'll find a fat, bad ass heroine in YA literature. Julie took something that many people shame others for, and she created a beautiful piece of literature that the world needs to read.Why is Dumplin' by Julie Murphy so good? It's so good because it's so real. I don't think you're going to find a character like Willowdean Dickson again this year. She's a real girl with real issues, but she also has so much empathy and compassion for others. What do I mean? Well there's no getting around it... she's fat, but she looks at people who have it worse than she does, and she truly feels bad for them. She makes her mistakes and makes fun of people, but she admits to it being wrong. This is why Willowdean might be one of my favorite YA characters.Before reading Dumplin', I'd read Murphy's debut novel, Side Effects May Vary. I can honestly tell you that these two books are very different. They just have different styles, and they I loved Murphy's writing style more in Dumplin'. I really felt like she was able to make Willowdean relateable to so many different people. I also just loved the words that she used during the book. I have about thirty different page flags in my copy because there are so many beautiful passages. It's just written in a very heartfelt way that will reach so many different readers. It's a fun and quick read, but there's just so much to it emotionally. You'll really feel everything when you read about Will's journey. Murphy really nailed this book, and I just want to fly to Texas and give her the biggest hug ever (and I hate hugs).The setting of the book also reflects a lot of the plot details. Dumplin' takes place in Clover City, Texas. From a quick Google search, I can tell that this is a fictional town, but Murphy includes so many of the beloved things about Texas (football, beauty pageants, iced tea, etc.) in Clover City that it might as well be a real town. Now I've never been to Texas, but I really felt like I would be able to go to any small town in Texas and picture myself in Clover City. The townspeople and the supporting characters just felt very real to me. It's definitely picturesque of what I imagine small town life in Texas to be.Now that I've mentioned the characters, let's get to them. Murphy includes a plethora of supporting characters, all of whom have a great purpose in helping Willowdean, and I definitely won't have time in this review to get to all of them. Will's best friend is El, and I loved how Murphy characterized her. These two have learned a lot from one another during their friendship, and they continue to learn more throughout the book. The friendship felt extremely realistic, and El is one of those characters that readers will remember for a long, long time. Will also has her fair share of possible boyfriends in this book (yes, plural), and you know what... I loved it. The two possible boyfriends, Bo and Mitch, are very different, but still very much needed. Will sees different things in them. Bo is very unexpected for Will, and she's very unsure about everything when she's with him. On the other hand, Mitch is the expected choice because they are kind of in the same boat. He's bigger, and they seem like a more natural fit, according to the crazy standards that we have today.So did I like this book? NO... I FREAKING LOVED THIS BOOK! I laughed. I cried. I felt every emotion with Will. I will cherish Dumplin' for the rest of my life because it's the book that I needed in high school. It's the book that I needed right now, in my adult life, when I still look at myself and cry over my pudgy stomach and my thunder thighs. Julie Murphy just gets it, and she makes everything feel like it's going to be okay.Dumplin' is a diamond. It's the world's finest diamond. Through Willowdean, Murphy is able to tell girls that it's okay to stand out but still be yourself. I'd recommend this book to absolutely everyone who's ever felt uncomfortable in his or her own skin. I'd recommend this to teens, parents of teens, librarians, teachers, or anyone who works with teens. I'd recommend this book to fans of the movie Beautiful Girls. (Side note: Watch that movie!) This book is a book that everyone needs to read because it will inspire you to do great things, even if those great things are just normal things that you thought you weren't capable of doing.",en

Actual Rating: 3.5Julie Murphy’s Dumplin’ follows the story of a high school girl, and tells the tale of all the drama in her life. She has a best friend who she’s been having trouble connecting with lately, a mother who seems to care more about a beauty pageant than for her own daughter, and a crush who makes her all too aware of all the imperfect things about her body. You see, Willowdean is overweight, trying to get over her beloved auntie’s death, all while trying to maintain the confidence she has in herself despite the world trying constantly to undermine her. Before going into this book, you find yourself believing that this is the story of a fat girl and her fatness; however, the book is not about being fat. It’s a book about one woman’s life, and she just happens to be fat. There are obstacles along the way because of how she looks, but ultimately, this book is about friendship, loss, family, first-love, confidence, and embracing who you are.“There’s something about swimsuits that make you think you’ve got to earn the right to wear them. And that’s wrong. Really, the criteria is simple. Do you have a body? Put a swimsuit on it.”The first thing that struck me as a reader was Murphy’s characterization; so often, when we’re reading books about underdogs, they are portrayed to be perfect human beings when it comes to personality. Not here. Willowdean is flawed in the way that she forms first judgments about other people- judgments that are often harsh. She can be cruel inside her own mind towards other people, but isn’t everyone, to some extent? Her development as a character becomes apparent as the book progresses- as she grows up, she learns to not only accept herself but others around her. Perhaps the one piece of critique this book gets the most is Willowdean’s judgments, but to me, that’s what makes her and the book so three-dimensional.The novel is multi-faceted, in the way that it doesn’t focus on one thing over another, giving the reader a perfectly rounded picture of Willowdean’s life. We see her friendships, her relationship with her deceased aunt and her mother, her boy problems, her work. All of these things work seamlessly together to construct a solid storyline.“I think you gotta be who you want to be until you feel like you are whoever it is you’re trying to become. Sometimes half of doing something is pretending that you can.”However, some of the secondary characters felt flat. There were so many of them that they can be hard to keep track of. Their personalities blend together after a little, and had the book been longer, perhaps the book would deliver more of a punch with all the different characters. The strange little love triangle was another thing I wasn’t big on- I didn’t think the book needed it, and if I consider the situation objectively, I don’t particularly think the situation was handled in the best way.But all in all, Dumplin’ is a solid contemporary that deals with an important issue with sass and poise, simultaneously. The ending is spectacularly handled: ambiguous but leaves the reader content. It’s a three-dimensional, fast-paced reader, good for even those people who don’t usually reach for contemporaries.Book Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",en

592,18304322,1313429575,it was ok,"2½ stars out of 5I wanted to like this book, you guys. I really, really did. But I wanted a book about a badass fat girl who enters a beauty pageant, and what I got was a love triangle where she can’t stop thinking about this one guy (whom I didn’t even like) and strings along another guy (who is so sweet to her and his only flaw is that his best friend is a jerk).Other things that annoyed me:- The beauty pageant felt like a minor part of the story to me. Willowdean doesn’t take it very seriously until maybe the very end of the book.- I really liked Willowdean’s friendship with Ellen–their best friendship is set up on the very first page–but they have a falling out that lasts more than half the book, and I hate when that happens in books. Their relationship was the center point of the novel for me, so as soon as they stopped talking, I checked out, emotionally.- I also enjoyed the “misfit” friends that Willowdean made through the beauty pageant, but I didn’t feel like we got nearly enough of them. Also, Willowdean wasn’t a great friend to them.- Millie, who’s a great character, is described by Willowdean on the 5th page as, “that girl, the one I am ashamed to admit that I’ve spent my whole life looking at and thinking, Things could be worse.” Millie may be large, but she is the badass character in this book, not Willowdean. She is so confident and doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her.Can I get a Grey-like rewrite of this book from Millie’s perspective instead? Willowdean is a relatable main character, but she was often mean to the characters I really liked, which got old very quickly.I did like hearing about Willowdean’s relationship with her deceased aunt (who was morbidly obese), and I could totally relate to her complicated relationship with her mother. Also, one of the side characters turns out to be LGBTQ, which was a pleasant surprise. Still, none of the positives were enough to bump it up to 3 stars for me, because the book ended up becoming one of those “finishing this feels like a chore” books. :(Did I mention how much I hated the love triangle?(Cross-posted on Youth Book Review)",en
593,18304322,1568341709,it was amazing,"I was looking for novels with fat heroines, and this one was really excellent. I really loved how nuanced Willowdean was as a character, both on her own merit and in her relationships with others. I like that it was a book about finding yourself, but that Will had so much confidence and belief in herself, except when it came to her weight. That was definitely something I really related to, so it was nice to see it spelled out on the page. I enjoyed her journey towards truly believing that she was worthy of love and sexual attraction. Truly believing it, not just knowing it logically. Every relationship was nuanced and complex. I enjoyed Will and Ellen working on maintaining their friendship as they grew up and apart. I loved the new friends she made with the other pageant girls, and I love that they all had their own struggles to overcome, that it wasn't just a weight issue for all of them. Will's relationship with her mother was fraught and complicated and painful at times, like all relationships between mothers and their teenaged daughters. Throwing the weight issue on top of that definitely strains things even further. I really enjoyed that things weren't perfect between them by the end of the novel, that it's likely going to be something they continue to grow and struggle through. I adored Will standing up for herself to her mom on multiple occasions. The romance was really great. I truly empathized with Will's struggles in coming to terms with Bo's feelings for her. Their 'breakup' was a bight overly dramatic, but I think we can allow teenagers their drama. Bo telling her he wanted to be with her, wanted to show her off and have everyone know, was just. A lot. I felt a lot of feelings, is what I'm trying to say, and I'm so glad the book gave us that moment because it's so important for fat teenage girls to know that they are worthy and deserving and there are boys out there who will be attracted to them as they are and want their bodies as they are. This book is definitely up there for me with The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things, in terms of books that have made me feel like it's okay to be myself in the body I have. ",en
594,18304322,1396643070,it was amazing,"I just finished this book and I'm crying about it and I need to tell you why.Never in my life have I read a book that so closely resembles my experience as a fat girl.I've read books with fat girls who lead miserable, horrible lives. I've read books with fat girls who are happy but they lose the weight and are then even happier. I've read books where the fat girls are goofy sidekicks and jokes. I've read books where fat girls have an over-the-top sassy confidence and nothing else to them, because that's it, that's there character, that's the joke - a fat girl with confidence.And I've read books where the fat girl is considerably more well-written, but she's a small fat. Obviously those girls and their bodies exist and are valid and deserve to have their stories told, but I have been so, so tired of being told, ""This book has a fat girl in it!"" only to find that she's nowhere near my size (and even without numbers, I can tell. The experience of being a small fat person and a superfat person are very different). Willowdean is different. I can't say if she's as big as me but I know she's close, and there's a girl in the book who's even bigger. Will goes through all the same little anxieties that I do, in my day-to-day life, in school life, in love. She has good days where she loves herself and doesn't care what people think, and she has bad days where she thinks she's disgusting. Sometimes those are the same day. Sometimes those are the same thought. She doesn't understand how she can be these two different people at once, but she is, and god, I get it. I cried and highlighted my way through this book where a girl who looks like me, who thinks like me, who struggles like me, gets to be a real person, and she gets to be happy. I wish, wish, wish that I'd had this book in high school. I wish I'd had Willowdean's voice in my head when I was a teenager who got, if she was lucky, a couple good days a year. But now there are teenagers who will get to read her story, who will see themselves in the books they love. I can only hope that one day I'll bring a book about fat girls into the world half as beautiful as this one.",en
595,18304322,1488614560,it was amazing,"Where do I start with my review of Dumplin', past saying how glad I am that I started 2016 off with such a completely amazing book. The story of Willowdean 'Dumplin' Dickson is a story I resonated with so deeply and so completely that I'm still a little reeling. Here is a girl who is big, and who is brave, but who is also self-conscious (even though she doesn't WANT to be) and who struggles with accepting the good things in her life in the same way that so many of us do. I love that the book seems to really balance that push and pull between a girl who seems so self-assured and confident that nothing could get her down; and a girl who is still a girl in our country and has to reconcile the way she sees herself with the way the rest of the world may - or may not - see her. The love 'triangle' here was a bit trite and seemed slightly unnecessary, although Mitch as a foil to Bo did have a couple of really nice character building moments for Willowdean. Even on the periphery we have this cast of characters who buzzes and circulates and world-builds without being distracting. It was a bit too easy to get all of Willowdean's pageant buddies mixed up because all their Traditional American Girl names got all muddled, but even just as a mass of units they still gave me giggles and a boost of the feel-goods. Willowdean's mother is a complicated character in and of herself, and I wish a bit more page time had been given to kind of sorting out this mother/daughter relationship. There are moments when it's definitely teased at, but it could have been handled in a way that gave us more insight into her mom, along with the insight we got into Willow.Why should you read this book? Because it will make you smile (and if you've ever been a big person, it'll make you love yourself and your experience in a way you may never have before, or at least in a while). Because it does a really good job exploring the more subtle dynamics of teen dating. Because, despite the fact that his name is Bo, he's fucking adorable.Because of Dumplin'. ",en

I also had such an embarrassing moment at an amusement park where my son wanted me to go on this roller coaster and I told him I did not think I could fit in it but he said mom cut it out you can. Well we get in and the young boy comes over to lock us in and he is pushing and I am sucking in my gut when he turns to me red face and says to me ma'am it won't lock because you are a little to big to fit in. I busted out laughing so hard because he was embarrassed that I laughed until I cried.Willowdean Dickson is my girl. Her mother calls her Dumplin because she is heavy but that does not stop her from dreaming about her being skinny. Then she meets Bo and they begin a relationship but it is weird so Willow sets out to prove to people that fat girls can do anything skinny girls can. She enters The Miss Clover City Beauty Pageant.

I so deeply, deeply wish that this book had existed when I was in high school and constantly bouncing between loving myself and hating my never small enough, constantly too large and unwieldy body. So often have I felt like I should apologize for being in public., for being large and taking up more space than is expected of someone my height, age, or whatever. This book captures the struggle of being a fat girl in a world that scorns anything resembling fat. The struggle to love yourself but to also fit expectations. This book made me laugh, made hurt, made me examine opportunities I've passed up because I felt I didn't deserve them... only because I was fat.

It's a joy to be in her company.The stakes for Willowdean are real, but the part of this book that spoke to me the most was her relationship with her best friend Ellen. They are at that tough stage where they've been friends for a long time but there are parts of each other they've never really understood. Ellen, who is thin and pretty and has a perfect boyfriend, doesn't understand the problems Will has because of her body.

I really needed a book that could tell me that no one's perfect, that it's ok to strive for something more, or to be confused about where you're going or how you feel. I know that all sounds pretty cheesy and moralizing, but it really wasn't, probably due to Julie Murphy's talents as a writer.

Bisher hat sie sich in ihrem Körper eigentlich immer wohl gefühlt. Sie ist eben dick – na und? Mit ihrer besten Freundin Ellen an ihrer Seite ist das sowieso total egal.Doch dann lernt sie den sportlichen und unfassbar attraktiven Bo kennen. Kein Wunder, dass sie sich hoffnungslos in ihn verknallt – dass er sie allerdings aus heiterem Himmel küsst, verunsichert sie völlig. Plötzlich macht es ihr doch etwas aus, nicht schlank zu sein.Um ihre Selbstzweifel in den Griff zu bekommen, beschließt Will, sich der furchteinflößendsten Herausforderung in ganz Clover City zu stellen: Sie will am „Miss Teen Blue Bonnet“-Schönheitswettbewerb teilnehmen und allen – vor allem sich selbst – beweisen, dass die Kleidergröße für das ganz große Glück überhaupt keine Rolle spielt.Meinung:Badeanzüge haben so etwas an sich, das einen denken lässt, man müsste sich erst das Recht verdienen, sie zu tragen. Aber eigentlich ist doch die entscheidende Frage:Hast du einen Körper?Dann zieh ihm einen Badeanzug an.Das Cover zu dem Buch gefällt mir, es ist sehr minimalistisch und trotzdem drückt es sehr viel aus. Darauf zu sehen ist Willowdean in ihrem Kleid und sie ist eben dick. Doch die Haltung von ihr drückt aus, dass sie es nicht stört.Die Sprecherin des Hörbuchs hat ihren Job sehr gut gemacht, eigentlich nerven mich die Frauenstimmen immer, doch hier war sie wirklich angenehm und ich konnte der Geschichte ohne weiteres ewig zuhören. Zwar hat sie nicht immer ihre Stimme verstellt, wenn jemand anderes gesprochen hat, durch die Betonung wurde das aber wieder ausgebessert.Die Geschichte ist einfach zusammengefasst, Willowdean ist dick und möchten allen beweisen, dass das ok ist und nimmt am Schönheitswettbewerb teil. Nebenbei gibt es noch eine Liebesgeschichte.Ich mochte Willowdean sofort, sie ist richtig sympathisch und ihre Gedanken gibt sie auch unverblümt preis. Doch auch sie trifft hin und wieder dumme Entscheidungen, so lässt sie Mitch ziemlich warten, während sie eigentlich auf Bo steht und mit ihm zusammen sein will. Das fand ich dann etwas gemein von ihr.Die Themen, die in dem Buch stark behandelt werden, sind Freundschaft und wie die Gesellschaft Dicke sieht. Dumplin lässt sich davon nicht unterkriegen, sie mag sich wie sie ist und erst als Bo sie beginnt zu mögen, denkt sie ans abnehemen. Ihre Freundin, Elle, und sie sind unzertrentlich, durch einen dummen Streit aber reden sie lange nichts mehr und die Einsicht, die Willowdean am Ende hatte, fand ich ziemlich gelungen. Allgemein zeigt das Buch sehr wichtige Themen auf und ich finde, dass nicht alles perfekt dargestellt wurde, aber dass man das Buch trotzdem lesen sollte. Willowdean ist ein toller Charakter und auch wenn alle anderen eher oberflächlich für mich blieben, hat mir das Buch sehr gefallen.Fazit:Das Buch ist nicht perfekt, bei Weitem nicht, aber es spricht viele gesellschaftskritische Themen an. Die Sprecherin hat wirklich tolle Arbeit geleistet und ich konnte mich ganz der Geschichte hingeben. Trotz einiger Schwächen vergebe ich 4 von 5 Sterne.",de

“I’m good at being who I am. I’m good at saying, ‘This is me. Back me up or back the fuck out.’ Ya know?”
Guys, Meet Will.  She’s funny, sarcastic and definitely no stick-figure silicone barbie doll. She’s the girl that YA audiences everywhere have been waiting for. She’s not some special snowflake that complains about everything under the sun and has two brooding guys fawning over her - though there is some very cute, very adorable fawning in this book (See Private School Bo). Willowdean is real. She’s honest. She’s a mess - but what sixteen year old girl isn’t? Willowdean Dickson is also fat. And that’s not an insult or a word to cower against and be afraid of. Will embraces it. She gives every Victoria Secret supermodel the finger as she tells girls everywhere that it’s okay to be confident and not be ""perfect."" I love love love this book. This is the kind of book that your kids are going to read growing up. You know those types of books you read when you were a kid - the ones that made your mother say Oh I love that author. Or I remember that from when I was a girl. You know the Judy Blume books, the Beverly Cleary and the Paula Denzer books. Well 'Dumplin' is going to be that book. Julie Murphy is going to be that author. This is the book that every little girl - or boy - needs to read to know that they’re perfect just the way they are. Seriously - move over Meghan Trainer. Will’s got this. She’s a girl that knows how she looks and is damn proud of it. Society’s standards of beauty? Pfft - society can shove it. Being a size zero? Please, double digits are where it’s at. Willowdean Dickinson has it all figured out. Except she’s a teenage girl and we tend to, well... not have things figured out. 	Because underneath her boldness, Will can’t help but be waiting for life to happen to her. In her small Texas town the only things to look forward to are Friday night football games and the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant which her mother runs. Neither of which seem all that appealing. It’s her, Dolly Parton and her best friend Ellen Dryver against the world. Yes. I said Dolly Parton. The thing about this book is Will, her best friend and her Aunt Lucy are all huge Dolly Parton fans. And when I say huge. I mean GINORMOUS. 
 ““But there’s something you have to understand about Dolly Parton fans: we’re nuts. And since there’s such this high level of crazy amongst all of us, I am, in comparison, not as batshit as most others. Like, there are people out there who have devoted their lives to creating ceramic Dolly Parton dolls. Some people even leave their jobs and families behind just to be near her.”“Okay,” he says. His brow crinkles together, and I can see that he’s really making an effort to understand. “Okay, but on, like, a scale of one to ten?”“On a scale of one to ten, ten being total nut job, I guess Ellen and I would be fours. Maybe fives? Mrs. Dryver is a total eight, but not quite a nine because she hasn’t had plastic surgery. Yet.””
Okay I lied. Maybe not Ginormous. But if Will is the heart and soul of this book - Dolly is the glue. We never actually get to meet the superstar, but we find out that she is the binding force of most of Will’s meaningful relationships. With her best friend Ellen, her mentor Aunt Lucy and quirky Gay bar owners Lee and Dale. And boy are her relationships meaningful. Will’s the type of person that feels everything. She doesn’t take people for granted. Take her and her Best friend El. Honestly these two are another aspect that make this novel worthwhile. It’s nice to read a book where the heroine actually gets along with other girls instead of just thinking that they’re all sluts or not as smart as her. And it’s amazingly refreshing to read a book where the heroine’s best friend isn’t just a token, where she actually has her own thoughts and feelings separate from the MC, where their relationship doesn’t take a backseat to the romance.  It’s El and Will’s relationship that moves this book forward, even when they’re fighting, even when they’re growing apart and even when they’re growing together. It’s Ellen that makes Will think that she’s ready for life to happen to her - or rather make life happen to her.Meet Private School Bo.And the Ladies Swoon.  Bo is one of those literary boys you wish you could date, get married to and then proceed to mother all his children. Rather than wishing he was real, I wish I was made up so I could jump into his hulking arms and ride off into a texan sunset. Sorry Willowdean - I still can’t decide if I’d rather be best friends with you and El or Bo’s gf. Anyway I digress....  It all starts when Bo gives Will a red sucker - which is a cherry lollipop for us northerners - and their relationship really starts to take off. There are nights gazing up at the stars, lying in the back of truck beds, oh and did I mention the kissing. Lots of amazingly swoonworthy kissing with gorgeously swoonworthy Bo. But most importantly Bo makes Will feel special, and loved, and not like a fat girl but just a girl.
“Willowdean Opal Dickson, you are beautiful. Fuck anyone who’s ever made you feel anything less.”
 Someone hand me a fan before I literally pass out on the floor. Hurry, I’m actually in an office right now. If I feinted it would be awk for everyone involved.This gem of a man says this beauty of a line to her and by damn if she doesn’t swoon. But being with Bo is too much for her. Especially when Will realizes that she doesn’t feel sexy or beautiful when she’s with him. Being with Bo brings down her defenses and turns her from the confident badass we know and love to someone much more vulnerable.
“The reality of him touching me. Of him touching my back fat and my overflowing waistline, it makes me want to gag. I see myself in comparison to every other girl he’s likely touched.”
And her insecurity makes sense. Because in order for Will to let herself be loved, she’s got to love herself first. So Will does what every self-respecting badass would do, she joins the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant. And Will’s not doing this for a guy - she’s doing this for herself and that’s the best part. She wants to challenge herself, gain confidence, ends up proving that you don’t have to be a beauty queen to, well, be a beauty queen.  Along the way there are bumps and roadblocks, sassy drag queens, great girl power friendships and crazy mom’s - namely Will’s own - who want to relive their glory days. Willowdean’s only human and she gets through this all with both finesse and blundering mistakes but that’s what makes this journey we take with her so worthwhile. Getting to be inside her head, to hear her voice is what makes reading this novel such a phenomenal experience. It’s hopeful, sweet, sincere but most of all real. 
“Sometimes figuring out who you are means understanding that we are a mosaic of experiences. I’m Dumplin’. And Will and Willowdean. I’m fat. I’m happy. I’m insecure. I’m bold”
 Here’s some parting advice. Read this book eyes wide open, heart ready to love and Jolene, running through your head like a theme song. I promise you that no matter what you will have a hell of a time.I only have one question, Julie Murphy: Will we ever get to find out about Ellen’s Oral Mishap?  Did someone say sequel?",en

I selected 12 contemporary books with the idea that I will be reading one every month so that I can truly say if this genre isn't for me (or maybe it is?!). I know the basic plot of this one I think: a fat girl competes in a pageant and gets a boyfriend (but I don't know if it's because of the pageant or not). Given how popular this book is, I'm assuming that it's not one where the girl changes to get the guy (aka, lose weight) but that she is (more) accepting of her shape. I really hope this is the case! I'm pretty excited to find out!After reading:This book... It feels kinda underwhelming. The characters were okay but we didn't really get to know them that much, especially Bo. Will's friends have their little key things (i.e. fat, horse teeth, uneven legs) but not much personality otherwise. Will herself is okay but I didn't love her or feel connected to her at all. I thought she could be mean to other characters who are having a rough time and she could be quite prejudiced at times. I get that she is flawed, I don't mind flawed characters but these flaws don't change in the story at all.The plot was okay but I feel like there are plenty of things that are pretty much the same as at the beginning of the book. Will's relationship with her mother isn't much better, Will still feels like there is this gap between her and Ellen, the bully is still a bully. The only change that I really noticed was that Will now has a boyfriend... Kinda... And that she has more friends... There also isn't much of Will and co preparing/participating in the pageant except some fun moments at a bar which I did love.And the ending was the most disappointing of all. It made me feel disappointed with the book but also with Willowdean. How hard is it to at least have the decency to stay and applaud for the winner of the competition?! Instead she just goes to her job to say Hi to her colleagues... I felt like that was very unkind of her and it made me finish the book with a nasty taste in my mouth.So overall, I kinda wonder what the point was of the plot. Not much seems to have changed... Not the characters or me as a reader. It was fun, it was quick but it's not a memorable book. I think I will pick up the sequel because I hope that it will fix things for me but right now I would say that this book is just okay. It's not life changing, it's not a book that I need to have on my shelves for forever and always. It's just okay.",en

But when one of the best looking guys in town is working with her and shows an interest, she's not sure how to take it. Why does he like her and how can they avoid everyone else thinking the same thing?I could totally relate to Dumplin'. I remember high school fondly and crushes and everything. It's the worst and best time in a young girls life and its also the time that makes quite an impact on your life. Will loves the way that Bo uses her full first name. When he kisses her one night after work and continues to kiss her, she is confused about why he is showing an interest. He is well known in their small town and she's sure that if they are seen together, the whole town will be talking. But how can she avoid him? To top it off, Dumplin's mom is in charge of the pageant and this is the last thing Dumplin' would ever do, but this year she decides to enter. Even though she thinks she has no chance of winning, why not? She inspires other unlikely contestants to join as well. This will definitely be the first for the Miss Teen Blue Bonnet Pageant.

As the annual Miss Teen Bluebonnet pageant is just around the corner, she decides to sign up for it as a protest. This escalates quickly, when other contestants follow her footsteps - revolutionizing the pageant and their small Texas town. Dumplin' is an uplifting story that nailed the idea of self-love better than I've seen before, without getting preachy. It's a delightful coming-of-age story that's as sassy and willful as the Dolly Parton tunes imbued within it. But maybe because I saw the movie first and then read the book, I feel like the former was better. I do usually love the book and only like the screen adaptation, except in some rare cases. This was clearly one of them. I didn't enjoy the sort of love triangle that was going on here with Mitch and Beau and I missed all the parts with the drag queens from the movie.

622,18304322,1379213301,liked it,"3.5 starsDumplin' is an exceedingly difficult book to talk about because, while there's a side of me that's ready to throw parades to celebrate this book's social perfection, another side of me is still shrugging her shoulders apologetically with a very contrite look on her face because she feels like she should ask the world's forgiveness for not really loving this book. That's the problem with books that are just ""okay"" on a personal level, but that are fantastic on an objective way and extremely important because of the message they carry. The same happened to me with The Truth About Alice and even The Last Time We Say Goodbye, both of which ranked barely above decent for me in execution, but are still books I'd recommend to people in a heartbeat because of the importance of the message they were written to convey. Dumplin' now firmly positions itself at the top of my ""Why can't I love you?!/What's wrong with me?!"" category. This novel is not exactly what I was expecting. It still is as body-positive as I hoped (and surprisingly sex-positive too!), but it took unexpected turns along the way to the point that I felt sometimes like the novel I started reading and the one that manifested itself after the first 50 pages were not the same. Body image is certainly the core of the novel, but the love-your-body thing and even the Dolly Parton and the beauty pageant parts of the plot, which I thought would be the central aspects of the novel, were relegated to the background a lot more than I expected. They hung on the periphery of the story, always there and guiding the story to a certain extent but rarely the focus of what was going on in most scenes. The novel is a whole lot more focused on Willowdean's relationships with others and day-to-day livings. I am very pleased with the way some of the relationships were developed in the novel. They were nuanced, complex, flawed and meaningful, particularly those Willowdean had with her mother and her best friend and even those she developed with her new pageant friends (though those felt forced sometimes). But I can't say the same for the romantic relationships in the novel, which are arguably the main focus of the story. The romance here was handled in a very odd way and I am stuck between admiration at its unconventionality and exasperation at, both, the forced inclusion of a love triangle and the way the author decided to wrap up Willowdean's romantic complications. While I greatly admire the author's decision to include a main love interest that's flawed, but ultimately, not shallow in spite of his social standing, I never really felt much chemistry between Willowdean and Bo, and most of the time, the whole thing felt a whole lot more like wish-fulfillment than actual, genuine romance. Similarly, I respected the author's decision to portray Willowdean as a flawed character by the way in which she behaved with Mitch, but whatever respect I have is vastly outweighed by the dislike Willowdean provoked on my through the thoroughly selfish, shallow, corwardly and hypocritical way she dealt with him. Willowdean is not a perfect character, she sometimes even crosses the line into downright unlikable, and I can understand how bold of a choice that was for an author trying to promote body-positivism and self-love. You want readers to see this message reflected on a character and feel it themselves, which is more easily (and lazily) achieved through a perfectly lovable and charming main character. Willowdean is charming, definitely fierce, but she's far from perfectly lovable. The entire story is about her learning far more than self-love (which she was already in possession of well before the story actually started), and actually has her considering about many other factors of who she is as a person. And she is, most definitely, selfish, self-centered, insensibly stubborn and cowardly. I'd like to say she grew out of all of them by the end of the book, but that's not true. Willowdean learns some things throughout the course of the novel, but she's hardly a much better individual towards the end. Sometimes I couldn't help feeling that, while the novel made a point of Willowdean learning Important Lessons, it sometimes went out of its way to justify her shitty actions or downright refused to address the fact that she had been, in fact, shitty to others. Still, she was a pretty good lead for this type of book.I deeply enjoyed that, for the most part, no part of this story felt manufactured and forced to jackhammer body-positivism into the reader's mind. Perhaps with the exception of the romance, this book has a pretty believable and realistic story that conveys a message that's easy to accept because of its honesty. I never actually laughed out loud with the book, but I must admit it was a fairly entertaining one. My biggest problem with this novel is probably that it took far too long to get anywhere. I like that it took its time to develop meaningful relationships which are usually so deliberately ignored in other novels, but at certain points it felt too round-about, too willingly stuck in order to halt the progression of things. By the time it decided to go anywhere, my excitement had diminished exponentially. All in all, Dumplin' is a very special book that deserves to be read. It delivers a very important message with great success and makes for a very entertaining read as well. I'm sad I wasn't able to love it, but this one of those books that I'll definitely recommend for many years to come. ",en

There was many times I was conflicted with the story and characters, though, but I'd say overall the positives outweighed the bad. I really loved the body-positive moments, but it was inconsistent when these moments occurred. Willowdean would be so strong about her body when dealing with her mom, but as soon as she was in relationships, she consistently couldn't see her body as loveable and there really was no progress with this. Another aspect that really sucked was how her body-positivity didn't extend to all body sizes, as she shamed the skinny girls. Body-positivity should support all body shapes and sizes. Aside from that, it was a cute storyline with developed characters, it just wasn't executed as well as it could've been. ",en

-----------------------------I'm a little sad to have to write this review, because so many people love and adore this book, and the character Willowdean. First off, I fully appreciate and understand why. Dumplin' has a really important message, which so many people need to hear today.But 
Dumplin'
 and I... Well, we never really hit it off. We probably should have, but we never did.On the surface, Will and I should have gotten along great. We have a lot of similar insecurities, so I definitely related to a lot of what she was going through. But unfortunately, I didn't really like Will that much, so I had a hard time staying in her head for the entirety of the book. Totally a personal preference thing -- if I don't like the main character or find them compelling, I'm just not going to enjoy the book.My main issue was that I kept seeing Will being not very nice to other people, and she herself does many of the things that she calls other people out on. She also goes back and forth a lot with regards to her confidence -- which is realistic, yes... to an extent. She relayed so many important messages about positive body image and self-confidence; but she also suffered from a lack of that same self-confidence. There were moments when I deeply related to her own self-doubt, and moments when I was pumping my fists when she'd talk about things like how we should never have to feel bad about the way we look. But through it all, I felt really disconnected from her, and I never grew to love her as a character. I'm not sure exactly where that disconnect stemmed from -- if it was just from the fact that I didn't really like her, or if it had something to do with not relating to her enough, I'm not sure -- but I felt it throughout the book.Another thing that I wasn't really expecting was how serious 
Dumplin'
 is. Don't get me wrong, the subject matter is incredibly important and these are messages that are necessary to convey in YA, but which are much too few and far between. They should be treated with the proper amount of respect and not laughed off or treated lightly. But there was a lot about the plot and relationships (with her friends, boys, her family...) that was definitely not happy (realistically so, but still). For me, there wasn't enough positivity elsewhere to balance that out. There was some silliness, and some humor, but just... not enough? Not the right kind? Obviously, again, this is an issue with personal preference and possibly a mood thing, for me.Also, a quick note about the romance, because most contemporaries with a hint of romance in the blurb are usually assumed to focus on that romance... I think it's important to note that 
Dumplin'
 really doesn't. Will's relationships with the boys in her life are pretty complicated, and they're important to Will's overall story; but if you're looking for a book with a focus on romance, and for those threads to be tied up at the end... this isn't that book. The romance isn't the point of this story, and for good reason; but while I appreciated that, I still would've liked a little more closure there. In conclusion...Can I be totally real with you guys for a second? I honestly feel bad for not liking this book more. As I said before, 
Dumplin'
 conveys a message that is incredibly important and (unfortunately) incredibly rare -- at least in the YA I've been reading (point me in the direction of more body-positive books, please?). I wanted to love this, to be able to yell from the rooftops about how amazing it is. But... I didn't connect with it. So I can't.I do feel like there was a lot of good stuff in this book, but none of it was pulled off in a way that hit home for me. Despite relating to the character, Will never clicked with me, and the tone was a bit heavier than I wanted/was expecting. So, as much as I wanted to love 
Dumplin'
, unfortunately, it was just okay for me.It's definitely a book that I'd recommend picking up for yourself, though, if the blurb appeals to you. You might also want to check out some other reviews, like Cassi's and Shannon's, who both really enjoyed it. :)--

631,18304322,2478939416,it was amazing,"I am fat.I'm not chubby. I'm not fluffy, chunky, stout, or big-boned. I am a fat person.Willowdean is also a fat person. And like me, she is not ashamed to be fat. I hope that in time she, like me, will grow to enjoy her size.Listen: I like being fat. I won't pretend that it makes my life easier -- it doesn't. In fact, in many ways it hinders me. But I like it. I might even love it. And I am loved despite, or maybe because, of it. I shouldn't say ""despite"" -- my size is not a flaw. I don't think it tells you much about me, other than that there is a lot of me.Julie Murphy is fat. She understands. She doesn't pander or shame. She knows that life as a heavy person is a life often dominated by two contradicting truths:1. To be fat is to be immediately noticeable. When a fat person enters a room -- specifically, when a fat person enters a room filled with non-fat people -- it's obvious. Sometimes the tenor of the crowd changes. Sometimes people snicker, or roll their eyes. Sometimes you're a gravity well for others' judgment.2. To be fat is to be invisible. When people see you they often have the impulse to dismiss you entirely. You're just another fat person to them, just another person with no self-control. A slob. You are erased by your body, consumed by it. You disappear into yourself.Willowdean is young. She's figuring things out. Maybe she'll be thin one day, but probably not. That's okay.There's a scene in the book where Will takes exception to the notion that certain things should only be afforded to people of certain size (specifically, swimsuits). She says that, if you have a body, you can wear what you want. It took me a long time to accept this. I used to believe that I could never be handsome, or attractive, or be something other than a weird, fat guy.I'm still a weird, fat guy, but these adjectives no longer reduce me.Listen: I contain multitudes.I am big: see me.I am loud, and jolly: hear me.Every bump against a table, every strained button: I exist.This is my yawp: I am loved, I am loved, I am loved.",en

Upon finding it at my public library one day, I knew I had to take it home with me. I couldn't miss a chance at reading Dumplin'!What I can say is that I totally agree with the majority of other reviewers about this book. It was definitely a strong, powerful novel, however it did have its fair share of flaws that I will cover later on.Dumplin' basically follows protagonist Willowdean. She has always been a tad overweight, and she has had no problem with this. Upon meeting a gorgeous used-to-be jock named Bo at her new fast food job, though, she finds herself doubting her weight. Although she has never imagined entering her city's beauty pageant that her mom runs, she does just that to regain her confidence.For the most part, I appreciate that Willowdean was confident and sure of herself, however as I explained, this self-confidence plummets throughout the book. Anyway, I am thankful that she was a loyal friend and that she embraced her flaws instead of covering them up. We don't need any more characters who complain day in and day out- we need more like Willowdean who has an overall positive perspective on things!WARNING- this is not stated in the synopsis, but this book includes a *rather annoying* love triangle. The two love interests are named Bo and Mitch, and honestly, I preferred Mitch a smidgen more. Unfortunately, though, I read this book too long ago to completely remember why.I don't have too much to say about the plot. It wasn't slow-moving like a turtle, but at the same time it wasn't as fast as a cheetah either. I guess it was just the perfect pace for me to be able to take in and appreciate all the events, you know?All in all, in spite of any and all flaws there were in Dumplin', I found that it was a powerful, robust, coming-of-age novel. Willowdean was a great protagonist and I liked her a lot, the plot was paced beautifully, and I forgot to mention this before, but there were strong and incredibly sweet family ties.

My copy was an ARC I got at BEA 2015.Diversity Rating: 1 – TokenismRacial-Ethnic: 1 (Hannah is half-Dominican)QUILTBAG: 1 (Hannah is a lesbian)Disability: 1 (One of Amanda’s legs is shorter than the other and she has a special boot for that)Intersectionality: 1 (See above for Hannah; Bo and Willowdean come from lower-class backgrounds)Life as an English major who doesn’t enjoy reading works written before 1900 has been a four-year game of balancing my dislike of/indifference to a work and my recognition of the work’s literary value. I don’t come across YA novels that make me need to perform the same act very often, but Dumplin’ is one of those rare YA novels. It has a lot of value and yet I don’t give two hoots about it.Wilowdean is a brilliant, dynamic character with more quotable lines in her head than a comment thread on Fandom Wank (may it rest in peace). If you have a part of you considered larger than “normal” or acceptable, like your breasts or thighs or maybe even your entire body, you’ll relate well to Will and her cycle of confidence and insecurity. Her experience spoke to me ass a woman with unfortunately large breasts thanks to the Puberty Fairy trying to murder me. I’m utterly fine with them now and have no problem running around in low-cut shirts–until people stare at me and make me feel uncomfortable and insecure. I eventually get back to the point of “screw you guys, I’m happy and sexy and you can suck it,” but the point is that insecurity results from external judgment, not internal. Will’s cycle proceeds the same way and really reads true.However, to be a little punny, Will doesn’t seem comfortable in her own skin. Rather, her own voice. Maybe it’s just me, but her voice doesn’t seem right. Like she’s holding back on us even when she’s at her most self-confident points. Voice in first-person YA novels is a tricky thing and Murphy doesn’t quite nail it. I don’t feel Will’s brash Texan attitude or humor even when she’s spouting Southernisms and being generally quotable. And how dare there only be one reference to The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.But, as mentioned in the intro, I don’t really care about Will crashing the beauty pageant with fellow misfits Millie, Amanda, and Hannah (the last of whom provides the only racial-ethnic and QUILTBAG representation in the entire novel). The pageant stuff I wanted more of as someone who competed in a scam pageant as a tween? Yeah, that was far in the background. It’s all about Will. That’s great and all, but I was here for the pageantry.There was also the racist microaggression against Native Americans at the end of the novel from Will’s best friend Ellen, who calls Will her spirit animal. STOP. NO-NO. Spirit animals, also known as spirit guides, are a sacred part of the traditions of a number of Native American tribes, not something for non-Native Americans to declare their love of something with. Maybe you like Jennifer Lawrence, but she is not your spirit animal. Go the Harry Potter route and declare things your Patrnus instead of appropriating something sacred from a culture that probably lived in the area Dumplin’ is set in before our ancestors committed genocide against them and/or forced them off the land.As I often say, no one is going to call a teen character unrealistic for being decent. If a teen fails to call something their spirit animal or doesn’t use the r-word in a book, I don’t think of them as too good to be true. You have nothing to lose by avoiding language that offends marginalized groups.Dumplin’ is the story a lot of YA readers have been waiting for: a fat girl whose conflict isn’t based on her weight and whether or not she loses a few pounds. If only I didn’t give so few hoots that I actually take hoots from people want to give them about other things just so I have more hoots to not give.",en

And it's good that there are now novels like this out there for the fat girls, like me, to read and relate to, at least a little bit.While I thought there were some major issues with Willowdean's attitude towards other people, the way they look, their weights, and other things, I had to keep reminding myself that she's a 16/17 year old kid, who's grown up in America, where being fat is one of the worst things you could possibly be. There were so many times throughout the first half (or more, I can't remember) where I wanted to punch Willowdean in the face when she internally mocked, ridiculed, or generally made negative comments towards the likes of Millie, Amanda, and Hannah. It felt like she was being a right bitch making the comments that she did (while internal, she still thought them), and it made me dislike her a bit.I did get over it, for the most part, though. It took me a while, but I began to really enjoy Willowdean's story. After reminding myself, for the umpteenth time, that she's just a kid, I found myself relating to her a lot. Yeah, I never had a boyfriend, or girlfriend, in high school, but I understand the not wanting to be touched because you're too fat, and somewhat ashamed of your body.She's very contradictory throughout this entire novel, tossing between her ""I don't care that I'm fat"" attitude, and letting it rule her behaviour - social and otherwise.It's good that she got over herself enough to realise that the beauty pageant wasn't just about her, that it was always more than just about her. I really enjoyed Millie's character, and I would have loved to have seen more of her in the story. Amanda, Hannah, and Ellen I enjoyed as well. They're all characters I would have loved to have seen have more time being written about and being seen throughout the novel. I just didn't think there was enough of them. But that's probably just me. =)Bo I didn't mind. While he was quiet, I thought he was rather sweet, from what we saw of him, at least.Mitch was okay. I didn't think there was anything special about him, and sometimes felt like he was a bit of a fill-in character - just another guy to fancy Willowdean. To show that there can be more than one ""type"" of guy into her.Speaking of - love triangles. Apart from the fact that they don't happen in real life (honestly, I've never even seen or heard of this happening and I know so many people?!?), I felt like it was too convenient for Mitch to be there, to have a crush on Willowdean, and want to be with her. While I understand his purpose, I felt like he would have been better off as a friend. I felt like his and Willowdean's friendship was left hanging at the end, though. He walks out and nothing is heard from him again for the rest of the story.The ending, to me, felt entirely too rushed. The beauty pageant was meant to be a massive plotline in the book, and it fell a little short. I loved the interactions with Willowdean, Hannah, Millie, and Amanda, especially when they went to the drag show, but their stories fell a little short when it came to the pageant. Though, I adore that Millie won second place. She deserved it so much.It just felt very rushed, like it was ""whoops, gotta write the end, now!"" and it was all typed out and printed like a last minute assignment.However, the book on the whole, I really enjoyed. The characters, the plot, the entire thing, was really enjoyable, quite relatable, to a certain degree, especially being a fat girl. So that's why the rating is 4 stars out of 5.",en
639,18304322,2135893045,did not like it,"When I picked up Dumplin’, I was expecting an uplifting, feel-good read, in the same vein as Clementine Beauvais’s 'Piglettes'. Instead all I got was a bunch of reading-slump-inducing drivel. Promised a vivacious, body-confident main character, I was highly disappointed by the selfish, judgemental and bitter hypocrite that Willowdean turned out to be. Throughout her internal monologue, she criticised others for their attitudes towards fat girls and those not considered to be conventionally attractive. Yet, she constantly contradicted herself, taking every opportunity to mentally body shame almost every person she met. Willowdean’s nasty nature was horribly evident in her mistreatment of Mitch, Bo & Ellen. Her volatile behaviour was inexcusable in most circumstances and was brushed over too lightly. However, it was her treatment of her mother that really riled me up. I understand that Willowdean’s weight had become a sore point between the two, causing underlying tension but it didn't warrant half the amount of hostility that Will showed. She came across as a defiant and ungrateful brat for the most part and lacked any basic empathy skills. On many occasions she outrageously accuses her mum of not caring about her own sister's death, mistaking her coping strategy as heartlessness.In fact Willowdean repeatedly acted as if she herself was the only person who was allowed feelings - as if the whole world revolved around her. She failed to consider anyone else throughout the novel, seemingly wanting to have her cake and eat it (note: the disastrous love triangle). People aren't perfect and I don't expect characters to be either, but they need to have enough redeeming qualities for us to root for them. With an unlikeable main character and far too many supporting characters to even care about, Dumplin’ lacked any real relationship or character development. Major relationships milestones occurred before there was even chance for me to form emotional attachments, but the plot itself tended to drag. The pageant has barely any significance for at least half of the book, despite being implied in the blurb as the main plot driver. The result is a book that feels simultaneously too rushed yet ridiculously slow and dull. I'd like to say the writing style redeemed the story, however, this was sadly not the case. It was rather basic and overly detailed where it needn't be. For example, Murphy provides full outfit descriptions for blink-and-you’ll-miss them characters. The supposed poignant scenes felt manufactured, falling flat of the emotional response Murphy had intended. This was partially due to Willowdean’s unlikeability but also in fault of the poor plot build up. There were so many things that made me want to put this book down, but the real crime was just how much Murphy missed the mark of her own synopsis. In one scene, Willowdean challenges the stereotypical representation of fat girls in fiction claiming that, unlike them, she did not secretly hate her body. The irony of this was not lost on me as that's exactly how Murphy portrayed Willowdean! Willowdean’s hatred of her body, her feelings of inadequacy and grief are incredibly relatable and important issues to address. However, if that was the story Murphy wanted to tell, she should never have packaged it as the inspirational tale of body positivity that it simply was not. I'm so sorry this has been such a negative review but I feel cheated out of the story I was sold. I honestly don't understand how Dumplin’ has received such high praise. It's personally the worst book I've read all year and altogether a big disappointment.",en

Ahora dirás ""Ella deja de presumir"" o ""ya, pobre-pobre tú"". La cosa es esta; nunca entendí porque mi delgadez supuestamente era algo bueno y de lo que debería estar ""agradecida"". Y lo mismo pensaba porque si no eras delgada o gorda, ahí, lo dije, no es una mala palabra, algo que me enseñó este libro, estaba mal. Es difícil sentirse bien con tu cuerpo cuando recibes comentarios pasivos agresivos todo el tiempo, te hacen sentir culpable, sobre todo si por una cosa médica el que seas de cierta manera. POR ESO, UNO DE MIS MÁS GRANDES MIEDOS ERA ENCONTRARME CON SKINNY SHAMING ENTRE SUS PÁGINASPero, no.Una de las cosas que más me gustó del libro que no solo es sobre sobre si eres flaco o gordo; sino sobre todas las inseguridades que podamos tener, esos defectos que nos hagan sentir culpables de vernos de cierta manera.Dumplin' es muy importante sobre todo porque nos dice de una vez por todas que la palabra gorda no es un insulto, es lo que uno es. Ser gordo, ser flaco, ser alto, ser bajo, tener ojos grises, ser blanco, ser negro, ser asiático, son solo una pequeña parte de quienes somos, pero sobre todo, ninguna de estas palabras debería ser usado como algo negativo o insulto. Lo mejor de todo es que Julie Murphy nos trae todo esto sin la necesidad de menospreciar a los demás, cosa para mí sumamente importante.Luego de terminar Dumplin' me di cuenta de que a pesar de que sé que esas cosas que menciono no son algo malo, aún tengo reserva de decirlas en voz alta, algo me gustaría completamente sacar de mí. Dumplin' definitivamente me hizo pensar un montón.GO BIG OR GO HOMEEn julio, cuando Disney compró los derechos para una futura película, la idea que tenía sobre el libro era que Will entraba al concurso de belleza por un chico y sería una historia un poco rosa. Más equivocada no pude estar.Ok, sí, una parte tiene que ver Bo, y es entendible, pero no en un 100% como pensé. Es mucho, mucho más. Y el hecho de que ni siquiera esté mencionado en la sinopsis, tan solo me confirma que es algo que el lector debe descubrir y que el cariño por esta historia comience. O sea, que no, no te voy a decir.¿ESTA HISTORIA RESULTARÁ PARA DISNEY? A las dos páginas del libro, grité un ¡sí! Pero luego, no estoy tan segura. Dumplin' es una historia que abarca muchas cosas, no solo aceptación de tu físico, sino también homosexualidad, discapacidad aunque en una manera muy superficial, y son esas cosas que hicieron este libro lo que es, cosas que Disney es bastante probable quitaría. Será cuestión de esperar. ¿es un libro que recomiendo? Sí y bastante. DEMASIADO.Twitter || Blog || Pinterest || Tumblr || Instagram || Facebook",es

DUMPLIN’ is a book that’s been receiving a tonne of hype. Seriously, who doesn’t love this book?! Me. I didn’t love it. I liked it and can see why so many people rave about it, but I wasn’t blown away.Why didn’t I have the same reading experience as most other people? For one thing contemporary isn’t my go to genre, I only read it occasionally for something different in between all my fantasy/sci fi. The other reason is that I don’t think I formed a very strong emotional connection to Willowdean. She’s a great character, very full of life and with a confidence I aspire to one day obtain, but I just never fully connected. It didn’t help that some things she did/said to her friends in the first half of the novel annoyed me. They were such selfish, horrible things, which she did learn from I do admit, but it didn’t help me like her more.“All my life I’ve had a body worth commenting on and if living in my skin has taught me anything it’s that if it’s not your body, it’s not yours to comment on”My favourite part DUMPLIN’ overall was the themes and messages it explored. Body image is a big issue all around the world and is guaranteed to affect everyone at some stage or another. Willowdean isn’t a small girl, but she is fairly comfortable in her body… until she isn’t. I loved how DUMPLIN’ showed everyone has insecurities and that’s okay. Your body doesn’t define you and you shouldn’t let your own self doubts or arsehole bullies to stop you achieving your personal goals and dreams. Don’t let them stop you from being the person you want to be. As a highly anxious person who worries about a lot of things (which sometimes includes body image but not always, because I’m too lazy to do anything about it) it was really inspiring and reassuring. Another aspect I enjoyed was the fact that the romance wasn’t in your face all the time. It had it’s role, and Willowdean dates people and thinks about relationships as any normal teenager does, but it didn’t completely override the point of the story. As much as I would have love to have seen more scenes with Bo, the amount in this book was just right.“News flash, Mom: a man will not cure my troubles”While I didn’t love DUMPLIN’ as much as almost everyone else seems too, I really do appreciate this book and the message it delivers. I’d recommend this for any YA fan looking for some words of empowerment and reassurance. ",en
643,18304322,1472391461,really liked it,"Dumplin’ by Julie Murphy was a book I knew I wanted to read. I’d heard great reviews from the people who had read so I knew I was going to like it and I was right! Willowdean is dubbed as Dumplin’ by her mother. It’s her nickname for her but there’s one thing Willowdean doesn’t want and that’s for all the people at school to catch on to the embarrassing title. Being a ‘larger’ girl Will has never felt comfortable in her body and even more so when she takes notice in Bo – the guy she works with. But when Bo starts showing interest in her Will just can’t be happy with herself she knows she will always compare herself to the much skinner girls. So in a way to try and take back her confidence and do something her late aunt could never do for herself, Will enters the Miss Clover City beauty pageant – the one her mother won all them years ago. But will she have the confidence and strength to show the world that not only skinny people deserve to be a Queen?I really enjoyed Willowdean’s story and I just loved the Dolly Parton reference’s. I had Jolene stuck in my head all the way through the story! Will was such a strong character at times and I so wanted for her to see her own beauty and become more confident about her body. Girls and Women are always worried about their weight at some point in their lives and I was sad for Will that it came so early for her and it was such a battle. I could sympathise with her struggles and my heart really went out to her. Her relationship with her mother was slightly rocky. I felt as though her mother really ‘helped’ her and just tried to ignore that she had a daughter that was slightly larger. I really wanted her to open her and just accept Will for the way she was but there was nothing wrong with her. And I really would have loved to have read more about Aunt Lucy who sounded liked the Mother Will should have had. Will and Bo’s relationship is a rollercoaster but one I loved. Bo didn’t look at things like Will, he didn’t see her as the ‘fat’ girl but just for her. He’s so sweet! In all, I really enjoyed Dumplin’ and I’ll definitely be keeping my eye out for more work by Julie! Thank you to HarperCollins for giving me the opportunity to review this book in exchange for an honest review.",en
644,18304322,1965862896,it was amazing,"OMG! I don't think I can love a book any more than I love this one! Talk about a perfect contemporary read; it's full of sass, friendships, first love, hurt, harsh words, family, and lots of love! Willowdean is my new favorite character! She's everything I wish I'd been in high school: she's sassy and confident, she stands up for people, she encourages her friends, and yet she's also a realistic and flawed person because she's bad at communicating, she's stubborn, and at times she's judgy. She really comes alive when reading this story. Bo is wonderful and fun and also bad at communicating sometimes and a little too perfect for a teen boy, but I love him anyway. Ellen isn't just the skinny, sassy best friend (even though Willowdean sometimes thinks she's the fat, sassy best friend and wants to be more than that); she's smart and kind and funny. It was really believable how their friendship drifted and how they could feel it was happening but didn't acknowledge it for a long time because obviously if you ignore something it goes away (not true). But sometimes friendships change and that's okay. Willowdean's mom is such a mom! When she's telling her daughter that if she lost some weight she'd look better or not-so-subtlety mentioning people who have lost weight I nodded along with her because my mom has done those things too. Her mom has good intentions; she's saying what she thinks are the right things but to Willowdean they're the wrong things and they come off like an attack on her self instead of something helpful. Girl, I feel ya! This book is the perfect amount of awesome and entertaining story with a little bit of a morale-booster thrown in! Willowdean's words of encouragement to herself (and the person reading) are a delight and made me smile. Like how to wear a bathing suit: Have a body. Put a bathing suit on it. And the part with the cross-dressing Dolly Parton's was amazing! I need more Willowdean, all of these characters, more pageant fun, and more of this little Texas town! ",en

Ho letto il secondo libro da me citato moooolto tempo fa e me lo ricordo poco e niente. La mia recensione, come ho scoperto da poco, elogia la scrittura della Murphy, le sue frasi meravigliose e dei ringraziamenti a fine libro da paura.Quindi, in pratica, oggi ve lo confermo: Julie Murphy è un'ottima scrittrice e io devo rileggere quel libro.Ma dedichiamoci completamente a ""Voglio una vita a forma di me"" perché a mio parere nessuno lo ha pubblicizzato a sufficienza.DOVETE LEGGERLO!Sul serio, io li amo i libri così.Ambientazione campagnola?

646,18304322,1218454419,it was amazing,"I didn’t expect much going into this book, but I have to admit, I fell in love with “Dumplin.” This book is filled with smart characters, complex relationships, and gives off a teenage “Miss Congeniality” vibe. The movie and this book both have a kick-ass heroine, complicated love interests, and a beauty pageant that takes place in Texas.Things I loved:Writing Style: Ms. Murphy's Writing style was perfect!!Setting: Texas. I love reading books that take place in the south. And after reading this, I knew Ms. Murphy had to live in Texas because the surroundings felt so real. From how they prepare their sweet tea, to how serious Clover City takes the teen beauty pageant. Character voice: A book with a smart array of characters. They talked like teenagers without sounding like they were trying too hard. There was an appropriate amount of cursing in this book as well. Willowdean had pitch perfect thoughts and will definitely stand out among the shelves.Theme: This is the most authentic, heart-warming, and real book on teenage bodies issues that I’ve read so far. As a bigger person, I identify with Willowdean. How some days she’s content with herself and her body, and other days she’s not. I loved reading about a fat heroine. --This is a book about relationships. We see Willow butt heads with her mother, fight with her best friend Ellen, and try to figure out her relationship with her sexy co-worker, Bo.

Not only that, but I also loved the way she described her town and just living in the South. The writing was so good that at times I forgot I was reading a book.Murphy created some realistic and complex characters. Even the minor characters were fleshed out. Will was such a great character. She made plenty of mistakes and was selfish at times, but she had a good heart and I found myself rooting for her the whole way through. I loved how honest she was about her insecurities. The group of friends that Will makes is one of my favorite parts about this book. They interacted with each other in such a fresh, fun, and honest way. It made me want to be part of their friend group. I liked how this book focused more on friendship than it did on romance because I feel like usually it’s the other way around.Speaking of romance, I liked the relationship that bloomed between Will and Bo. It was far from perfect, but at the same time, it wasn’t unhealthy. I enjoyed the moments of conversation between the two of them because it really added depth with their relationship.

Willow had a good voice; her story was a little boring. I liked the Dolly Parton parts, the reconciliation with her mom, and the grief over her aunt. The hardest part of this book for me was the boys. I really liked Mitch and I thought she totally took him for granted. I also thought Bo was possessive and rather demanding -- uncomfortably so at times. He was unappealing and their relationship was a lot of dragging each other around. It wasn't healthy and I thought Mitch was the much better choice. He actually treated her well and with respect. Finally, the best friend fight was lame. The other girls were amazing and actually helpful. Ellen always abused Willow and I didn't think they should make up. They were only friends based on memory, not on what was actually happening in their lives. The other three girls were the ones that believed in her. It was a silly plot point and I didn't enjoy that part.Overall, the perspectives were the best part. I liked how Willow explored other parts of her life and grew somewhat but no enough.

That said, what really struck me about Dumplin' was how very ambitious it was in terms of fat positivity. Willowdean's growth as a character -- from internally shaming/scorning her dorky fat classmate to recognizing that same classmate's powerful selfhood without weight loss or an image shift -- is a huge undertaking, especially because it skirts but never slides into inspiration porn. Similarly, the way the author handled Willowdean's relationship with Lucy, and what we learn about Lucy as a character over time? There was a lot of delicate character-building work there. It would have been really easy to slide into good fat/bad fat with this storyline... a Health at Every Size, Body-Positivity 101 style YA. And that wouldn't have been terrible necessarily, but it wouldn't have been all that exciting either. The fact that Julie Murphy managed to create this as a Fat 201 instead of a 101 is incredibly impressive. It makes me hopeful. IMO the most well-done YA with fat characters (characterS!!) I've read.

Willowdean é uma protagonista segura de si e incrivelmente divertida, mas em alguns momentos ela acaba sedendo para o padrão imposto pela sociedade e isso me deixou um pouco chateado, é claro que ela passa a mensagem de autoconfiança muito bem mas talvez ela não seja tão autoconfiante assim. Sendo assim, acabei me questionando sobre a construção da personagem, se ela realmente precisava ""deslizar na lama"" para se autoafirmar na história. Este foi o ponto mais negativo que achei, mas compreendo que isso faz parte do nosso dia-a-dia e nem todo mundo é cem por cento confiante em si mesmo. Os personagens secundários são maravilhosos, me apaixonei por cada um deles e foi lindo ver como o tema ""amizade"" foi abordado nesta história.

670,84979,94411694,it was amazing,"6.0 stars. Confession...this book gave me an earth-shattering Janeaustegasm and I am feeling a bit spent and vulnerable at the moment, so please bear with me. You see, I decided I wanted to get more literated by reading the ""classicals"" in between my steady flow of science fiction, mystery and horror. The question was where to begin.After sherlocking through my Easton Press collection, I started by pulling out my Dickens and reading A Tale of Two Cities which I thought was jaw-dropping AMAZO and left me feeling warm, satisfied and content. It also made me made retrospectively pleased that I named my youngest daughter Sydney.After Two City “Tale”ing, I decided to give this book a whirl as I kept seeing it on GR lists of ""goodest books ever."" However, I must admit I was hesitant going in to this for two big reasons. One, I thought it might be a bit too romantical for me. The second, and much more distressing, reason was that Twilight was on many of the same lists as this book. Austen fans should pull a nutty over that one.So needless to say I went into this thinking I might hate it. Well, for the 999,987th time in my life (at least according to my wife’s records)...I was wrong!!! I absolutely loved this book and had a mammoth, raging heart-on for it from the opening scene at the breakfast table when Father Witty (Mr. Bennet) is giving sly sarcasm to Mrs. Mommie Put Upon. I literaphorically could not get enough of this story. I was instantly captivated by the characters and Elizabeth Bennet, the main protagonist, immediately became one of my all time favorite characters. Mr. Darcy joined that party as soon as he showed up in the narrative as I thought he was terrific as well.Overall, the writing could not have been better. It was descriptive, lush and brilliant. The story could not have been more engaging or intelligent and the characters could not have been more magnificentastic. Elizabeth and Fitz are both smart, witty, self-confident and good. Austen could not have written them better. Oh, and I am sorry if this is a bit of a minor spoiler but I need to add that George Wickham is a cock-blocking braggadouche of startling proportions. I needed to say that and now I feel better. This one has made it onto my list of All Time Favorite novels and is truly one of the classics that lives up to its billing. A FINAL WORD TO THE GUYS: ...Guys, do not fear the Austen...embrace the Austen...HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!! ",en
671,84979,187911,really liked it,"""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult. I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen's dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed. In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen's novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future.

In all honesty I barely remember this book. So, negative comments regarding my intelligence are no longer necessary. They will be ignored. As they have been for probably 6 years now. CARRY ON!P.S. Can we all just LOL at my use of the words ""mind-numbing balls""?? HA. This book is quite possibly the most insipid novel I have ever read in my life. Why this book is so highly treasured by society is beyond me. It is 345 pages of nothing. The characters are like wispy shadows of something that could be interesting, the language that could be beautiful ends up becoming difficult to decipher and lead me more than once to skip over entire paragraphs because I became tired of having to stumble through them only to emerge unsatisfied, and the plot is non-existent, as though Austen one day decided she wanted to write a novel and began without having any idea what would happen except that there would be a boy and a girl who seemingly didn’t like each other but in the end got married. The story really probably could have been told in about 8 pages, but Austen makes us slog through 345 pages of mind-numbing balls and dinner-parties.

 Elizabeth Bennet  (second eldest of the five Bennet sisters) is the one with a  clear, level head.  Jane is the beautiful one, Mary is the look-at-me-I'm-so-pious one, Lydia is the I'm-so-dumb-that-I'm-probably-going-to-get-murdered one and Kitty is the well-she's-just-kinda-there one. Now, back in the day...there was one, singular goal for all women above the age of 16. GET YOURSELF A MAN  before you reach 25 and become a 
SPINSTER
 *cue high-society ladies fainting*. 

 Mrs. Bennet (their mother) has taken this so completely to heart that she thinks of nothing else. After all, 
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
 Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy moved into town and immediately Mrs. Bennett set her dasterdly plans in motion (on behalf of her mortified children). She will do whatever necessary to get a rich man to put a ring on it (oh Beyonce, your words are applicable in any century).
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
 Only, there is a snag in her otherwise flawless plans. Elizabeth is not going to roll over to whatever man is thrust her way. To her mother's ever-living-disappointment, Elizabeth has all the spunk and backbone of a truly glorious woman: 
I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.
 Truly a great read, no matter the century.Plus Jane Austen is totally my soul sister.
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! -- When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.

679,84979,16319303,it was amazing,"Critics who consider Austen's works trivial because of their rigid, upper-class setting, wealthy characters, domestic, mannered plots and happy endings are almost totally disconnected from reality, as far as I can tell. What can they possibly expect an upper-middle class English woman to write about in 1813 but what she knows or can imagine? Sci-fi? A history of the American Revolution? A real-life exposé of underage exploitation in the garment district of London? Come on. What other setting can she be expected to tackle with authority? Austen's value lies in her portraiture: her characters are believably human in their concerns, vanities, failings and quirks. The plots serve largely to showcase their interaction and thus, her observations of human nature, which are pointed, accurate, and hysterical. Here, in her best work (my opinion), her technical skill as a writer also shows in Pride and Prejudice's tight plotting and economical casting; there are no superfluous characters or wasted chapters here. My college lit professor used to go on and on about this novel as a revolution of literary form in that dialogue drives the plot as much as exposition; I'll buy that but it doesn't thrill me for its own sake as much as it did her. It does mean, though, that Pride and Prejudice is a relatively smooth and lively read, that we learn about events and characters as much from what they say to each other as from what Austen narrates to us. The banter between Darcy and Elizabeth isn't empty flirting, it's a progression, a chart of their ongoing understanding/misunderstanding and a way to take stock of plot developments as well as an enjoyable display of wit. Austen's heroines are famously caught between love and money are famously criticized for always getting both in the end. I've got no problem with this wish fulfillment. Keep in mind that being married is basically the only possible 'job' available to a woman of her position--marrying a rich dude is the only viable escape from the life of poor-relation dependency Austen herself lived, there's nothing reactionary or anti-feminist about it. The other option--becoming a governess--is barely respectable, putting a woman into an ambiguous class limbo of social invisibility that translates directly into a loss of safety and self-governance. Expecting Elizabeth to, what, become a doctor? is silly and anachronistic, and perhaps if that's your preference you'd be better off reading Clan of the Cave Bear, with Ayla and her bearskin bra, or what have you. Pride and Prejudice is simply a joy to read, a dance of manners and affection between the leads and a parade of human silliness in the supporting cast. edited to add: some thoughts specific to the Patricia Meyer Spacks annotated edition I received as a gift for Christmas 2010:It’s quite remarkably handsome, and sturdy, and useful for whacking spiders if you are that sort of person. Generously illustrated with color and black-and-white sketches, engravings, and reproductions of earlier editions, household objects, relevant artwork, contemporary cartoons, diagrams and fashion plates.My attention wandered during the editor’s introduction in what turned out to be a horribly familiar way. While I appreciated Spacks’s discussion of historical background, her warnings about the subtlety of language and characterization, and the dangers of identifying too much with our favorite characters because Austen stacks the deck for that purpose, etc etc, it was a sort of technical appreciation--dry, and a little bit soulless. I was, perhaps, impatient. At some point as I yanked my eyes back to the pages I kept trying to read, I realized: Spacks is a Professor Emerita at the University of Virginia--my former stomping grounds (wahoo-wa!) (...sorry, that happens)--it’s more than possible she was MY professor back in 19. I don’t remember her name or face, but certainly her style, the steel trap of her mind, and the mildly pushy feeling of her obsession with language all felt very very familiar. So, grain of salt: I may have some kind of baggage here.That said, this is a must-own for the serious P&P fan. As with any annotated edition, I wouldn’t recommend it for a first or even third reading of the book--these notes take up half-to-full pages, sometimes continuing to the next, and only if you’re already familiar with the text of the book itself can you spare attention to wander off down these other roads. Keep another straight copy of P&P around for when you just want to read the thing. Some footnotes are simple definitions, or style notes: some are mini-essays that include their own cited references. Spacks includes centuries of Austen scholarship in her notes, not just contemporaries, so points of view vary widely. There’s quite a smorgasbord of textual commentary to pick through, and you’re sure to find little tidbits that strike you as especially resonant or horrendously wrong and weird. Two tidbits I liked: first, a primary source. One note, in discussing the complicated British class system of the day, refers to a table constructed by one Patrick Colquhoun in his A Treatise on the Wealth, Power and Resources of the British Empire, in Every Quarter of the World (2nd ed., London, 1815, pp 106-107)--a table which lays out exactly where, for instance, Darcy stands in relation to the Bennett family. He’s in the “second class,” they’re in the fourth. Clearly people put a lot of time and effort into codifying and arguing about societal structure, status and behavior, and I think that would be a fascinating thing to read. Another note I lingered over involves Mr. Collins, a character we love to hate. Here's the upside of an annotated edition: I’d never bothered to give Mr Collins much of my attention, since he’s icky--but Spacks points out the oddity of a snippet that I'd always ignored before. In bidding Elizabeth farewell from Hunsford, Mr Collins apologizes profusely for the humbleness of his style of living, as if he considered her socially above him--and this is a complete 180 from his incredibly condescending proposal of marriage earlier in the book, where he deigns to presume he’s taking a burden from her parents by opting to support her. Also, Spacks has a lot to say about Elizabeth's inconsistency and lack of generosity towards Charlotte Lucas--traits I'd noticed in past readings without following through to some of their logical conclusions and their connections with Elizabeth's later behavior.Definitely worth the purchase price! Add it to your collection, but don't make it your only copy, since it's hard to tuck under your pillow. ",en
680,84979,108596768,really liked it,"Well-loathed books I've re-readRating: 4 very annoyed, crow-feathered stars out of fiveThe Book Report: No. Seriously. If your first language isn't English, or if you're like nine years old, you might not know the story. Note use of conditional. My Review: All right. All right, dammit! I re-read the bloody thing. I gave it two stars before. I was wrong-headed and obtuse and testosterone poisoned. I refuse to give it five stars, though. Look, I've admitted I was wrong about how beautiful the writing is, and how amusing the story is. Don't push.Stephen Sullivan, who rated this with six stars of five, is now on a summer travel break from Goodreads, so I can publish this admission: He was right. It is a wonderful book. I had to grow into it, much as I had to grow into my love for Mrs. Dalloway. But now that I'm here, I am a full-on fan.Deft is a word that seems to have been created for Austen. She writes deftly, she creates scenes deftly. She isn't, despite being prolix to a fault, at all heavy-handed or nineteenth-century-ish in her long, long, long descriptions. She is the anti-Dickens: Nothing slapdash or gimcrack or brummagem about her prose, oh nay nay nay. Words are deployed, not flung or splodged or simply wasted. The long, long, long sentences and paragraphs aren't meant to be speed-read, which is what most of us do now. They are meant to be savored, to be treated like Louis XIII cognac served in a cut-crystal snifter after a simple sole meunière served with haricots verts and a perfect ripe peach for dessert.The romantic elements seem, at first blush, a wee tidge trite. And they are. Now. Why are they? Because, when Miss Jane first used them in Pride and Prejudice, they worked brilliantly and they continue so to do unto this good day. Why? Because these are real feelings expressed in a real, genuine, heartfelt way, as constrained by the customs of the country and times. And isn't that, in the end, what makes reading books so delicious? I, a fat mean old man with no redeeming graces, a true ignorant lower-class lout of the twenty-first century, am in full contact with the mind, the heart, the emotional core of a lady of slender means born during the reign of George III.You tell me what, on the surface of this earth, is more astonishing, more astounding, more miraculous than that. Jane Austen and I Had A Moment. She's Had A Moment with literally millions of English-speakers for over 200 years. She's had moments with non-English speakers for more than a century. Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are cultural furniture for a large percentage of the seven billion people on the planet. (Large here is a relative term. Less than one? Still amazing for a book 200 years old.)Reading is traveling in time, in space, but most importantly inside. Inside yourself, inside the characters' emotions, inside the author's head and heart. It is a voyage of discovery, whether you're reading some bizarro mess, Dan Brown's mess, religious tracts, Twilight, whatever. You-the-reader are going somewhere in a more intimate contact than you-the-reader have with any other being on the planet. Movies, TV, sex, none of them take you as deep into the essence of feeling and emotion as reading does. And no, snobs, it does NOT matter if it's well written, it matters that the book speaks to the reader. (Sometimes, of course, what one learns is how very shallow and vapid some people are...I'm lookin' at you, Ms. Fifty Shades.)So I thank that rotten, stinkin' Stephen-the-absent Sullivan, safe in the knowledge he won't see me admitting this, for reminding me to live up to my own goal of remaining open to change. I heard him yodeling his rapture, and I revisited the book, and I learned something valuable: Only admit you're wrong when the person you don't want to embarrass yourself in front of isn't around to see.

681,84979,37822688,it was amazing,"Mr. Darcy...*swoons*First, we need to clear something up. Colin Firth is the only Mr. Darcy.That other Mr. Darcy was horrible! No, no, no, no, nooooo!Make it stop. Make. It. Stop. Tell the bad man to go away, Mommy!So, quite obviously, the BBC miniseries (in all its 327 minute glory) is the only version that is acceptable. The other movie was such a travesty to this book, that I wept big, fat, angry tears...like the spoiled brat that I am. Or maybe I'm exaggerating slightly. What were they thinking?! You don't mess with perfection!What did you think, Elizabeth?Exactly.Anyway, instead of reading it this time around, I listened to an audio book version. Apparently, which audio version you listen to makes a difference.My real-life BFF said her version had an American 
doing British accents
, and she found it terribly annoying. I, however, had a version with an actual lady from the land of tea 'n crumpets, and she did a fine job. Well, she did have this lounge singerish voice, so instead of sounding like a fresh-faced 20 year old, Elizabeth sounded like she had been smoking 3 packs a day for about 40 years.Eh, I was ok with it. I kept imagining Lizzie with a cigarette dangling from her lips like a truck stop hooker, and it gave the story a fresh perspective.I've read this so many times over the years that I've lost count, but I still wish I could go back and read it for the first time all over again. I hated that stupid, arrogant, arse-faced Mr. Darcy when he first showed up at the ball. Ugh. What a prick!So, just like Lizzie, I remember being shocked at his proposal. And just like Lizzie, I was horrified by the way he dissed her family while he did it!And how could he think she would ever agree to marry him after the way he convinced Bingley that Jane didn't love him?! And the way he treated poor Wickham!Just who did this guy think he was! But then...The Letter!Oh, my! Well, that certainly put a different spin on things didn't it?!Elizabeth & I were so ashamed that we had judged him so harshly.*hangs head*And the way he acted toward us when we met near the lake!So kind...such a gentleman!Ok, I've probably read that particular scene (at Pemberley) a million times.

682,84979,1801077413,it was amazing,"Society, with all its restrictive constructs, is one nasty piece of work. It comes with so many silly rules, so many silly expectations. Those of social station and wealth must be seen to marry someone of the same “worth” regardless of the feelings involved; they must be seen to marry someone on their level of class structure. But what of love? What of passion? Should it be quenched because of these all-encompassing silly constructs? Austen doesn’t think so. Enter Darcy, a man who is royally pissed off; he has fallen in love with someone considered far beneath him, to declare his love for her is to step outside the realms of his supposed pedigree: it is a form of social death. So he is a man torn in two. At the route of things, he is a product of his society; consequently, he is affected by its values. Although he hates it all the same; thus, the long sullen silences, the seemingly moody and arrogant exchanges with Elizabeth. But it’s all the expression of a man struggling to deal with the raging tempest of emotions that have taken hold of his mind: his being. “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.” Indeed, Austen slowly reveals the dangers of false perception as she gradually peels away the mask of this stoic pillar of aristocracy, and underneath blossoms a misunderstood and sensitive soul. So the romance plot is born. Elizabeth eventually loses her prejudice and sees through Darcy’s false pride. Darcy loses his integrated construct of prejudice and ignores the pride of his relatives. As ever with Austen, the title of the work is suggestive of the main motifs; she’s never subtle as its all ways clear which way her razor sharp sarcasm is pointed. So love conquers all. Austen was a strong advocate of social mobility, and often it’s based upon love in her works. But she only believes in real love. She’s not interested in fleeting moments of heat and sexual lust; she portrays true and lasting romantic attachments, relationships that are strong and real. For her, such things transcend class boundaries, wealth and intelligence. Love is love. It doesn’t matter who it is with as long as it is real; hence, Austen becomes a critique of society and its customs that prevent these relationships from being realised. She knows how stupid it is, and she loves to poke fun of her caricatures of the old stilted class of her era: the ones that resist her ideas.  Is this the best Austen? I did really enjoy this book, and I have given it five stars, but it’s not as good as her other works. For me it lacks the moral growth of  Northanger Abbey  and Emma.It lacks the conciseness of Persuasion. The emphasis on the injustice of romance has made it popular, though I do strongly believe that the love in Persuasion is stronger than it is here. That endures rejection, separation, war and decades; yet, it still lingers. I love Austen, and I have loved each one of her books I’ve read so far in different ways. I hope to continue to do so. This is the fourth Austen I’ve given five stars, I can easily celebrate her as one of my favourite writers.",en
683,84979,1452512123,it was amazing," “We are all fools in love.” 
Why have I not read this sooner?I must admit, I didn't initially understand all the fuss surrounding this novel. I did not understand why so many millions of readers love it. It seemed to me they were all a bunch of romantic fools. Now that I am 'one of them', I can report back that the Pride and Prejudice fandom is actually full of normal people who care passionately about the characters.I instantly fell in love with the story and its amazing characters. Marvellous, magnificent, superb, delightful... Just some words to describe how great this novel is. I’m so damn sick and tired of hearing about 'alpha males' and how women just love them and how 'they're so hot'. I love beta men/nice guys.It's refreshing to read about a hero who doesn't have to use foul language and violence to get attention and power. 
Mr Darcy is a gentleman. He is intelligent and wellinformed, competent, cool-headed, strong, yet silent. He is also arrogant and prideful. Hey, nobody's perfect. He suffers from a social shyness and awkwardness that is received by others as rudeness. 
Mr. Darcy stands the test of time because he recognizes Elizabeth as an equal, he is not threatened by her intelligence and outspoken personality. In fact, Darcy appreciates all those traits.They're such different people but alike in many ways. He and Elizabeth have such respect for each other, and I think that's what makes the romance in Pride and Prejudice such a success. 

And now I'm just going to compare every man to him and basically, I'm ruined forever. FOREVER.
And let's not forget his estate. 
Sure, Mr Darcy has his issues and his flaws (so many times I wanted to scream at him and Elizabeth to get over themselves and talk already, I mean come on just get together already good grief this is ridiculous).Antigone, Annabeth Chase, Arya Stark, Scout Finch, Clarice Starling and Scarlett O'Hara are pretty much guaranteed on any of my favourite heroines lists and now I can add Elizabeth Bennet to that list too. Elizabeth is such an admirable heroine. And boy is she one smart tough cookie. She stands up for herself and those who matter to her, she loves to read and she thinks for herself. She is a woman far ahead of her time. If you haven't read this yet, read it now. It's a wonderful book, easy to read, even though it was published in the early 19th century. It will play on your emotions, and it will make you think. Well done, Miss Austen. 
Nice try, sir. But you're no Mr Darcy. 
This never happened in the book but I couldn't help myself.

686,84979,35624020,,"Some years back in one of my APAs, someone castigated Jane Austen's books like this: ""All those daft twits rabbiting on about clothes and boyfriends and manners.""Since then, I’ve encountered other variations on the theme that a modern woman ought not to be reading such trash because it sets feminism back two centuries.Well, much as I laughed over the first caveat, that isn't Austen. It sounds more like the silver fork romances inspired by Georgette Heyer. Austen's characters don't talk about clothes at all, outside of air-headed Mrs Allen of Northanger Abbey, who doesn't think of anything else. Austen sticks her satiric quill into young ladies who think and talk about nothing but beaux, such as poor, luckless Anne Steele in Sense and Sensibility. Manners are emphasized but not manners without matter; Austen saves her spikiest irony for hypocrites.I think it's important to remember that whereas Heyer was writing historical romances in the silver fork tradition, Austen was writing novels about contemporary life, especially the problems facing young women in her own walk of life, the country gentry. She criticized herself in a much-quoted letter to her sister Cassandra, saying in effect, 'the problem with Pride and Prejudice is it's too light and bright and sparkling.' Many have misinterpreted this remark. It seems to me, on close reading of her elsewhere, that she meant the novel to be taken more seriously than it was.What is it about, really? It's about the wrong reasons for marrying, and how those can affect a woman for the rest of her life. Of course a hard-line feminist can point out that novels about marriage are hideously retro for today's woman, who has many choices before her. During Austen's time, marriage was the only choice a woman had, unless she was rich enough to shrug off the expectations of her society, or unless she was willing to live on as a pensioner to some family member or other, which more often than not meant being used as an unpaid maid. Of course there was teaching, but the salaries for women were so miserable one may as well have been a servant. The hours and demands were pretty much equal.If one looks past the subject of marriage, the novel's focus is about relationships: between men and women; between sisters; between friends; between family members and between families. As for marriage, Austen sends up relationships that were formed with security as the goal, relationships that were sparked by physical attraction and not much else, relationships made with an eye to rank, money, social status, or competition. And, with abundant wit and style (or as she’d say, with éclat), she offers some truths about the differences between love and lust, and what relationships based on either mean to a marriage months—or decades—after the wedding.The fact that Austen doesn't use modern terminology doesn't make it any less real than a contemporary novel that has a supposedly liberated woman romping from bed to bed for forty pages while in search of the perfect relationship. The message is the same, that women who mistake falling in lust for falling in love are usually doomed to a very unhappy existence. And in Austen's time, you couldn't divorce, you were stuck for life.I've had dedicated feminist friends give me appalled reactions when I admit to liking Austen. I don't consider reading Austen a guilty pleasure, as I do reading Wodehouse. I consider Jane Austen a forerunner of feminism. She doesn't stand out and preach as Mary Wollstonecroft did. Her influence was nevertheless profound. Again and again in those novels she portrays women thinking for themselves, choosing for themselves—even if their choices are within the conventions of the time. What the women think matters.In Austen’s day (and too often, now) female characters were there as prizes for the men to possess, or to strive for, or as catalysts for male action. These days we call them refrigerator women. Jane Austen gave her female characters as much agency as a woman could have in those days, and the narrative is mostly seen through their eyes.The famed relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy makes it very clear that they were first attracted by one another's intellect—those two were clearly brain-snogging before they ever got to the fine sheets of Pemberley. It is also clear that the man—his higher social and economic status notwithstanding—had to earn the woman's respect, and rethink some of his assumptions, before she could see in him a possible partner. There is no dominant male making the decisions: those two are equal right down to the last page, and Austen makes it clear that it will continue to be so after the marriage. Each time I reread the novel, I notice something new, but in the meantime, will I continue to recommend it to young women just venturing into literature? You bet.",en

691,84979,101898240,really liked it,"""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that it had begun."" This was Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy's reply when Ms. Elizabeth Bennet asked him when he fell in love with her. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen had put my left out dictionary into good use. I have to admit, I was very slow in the first pages, however, nearing the end, I was like a driver going at 100mph, eager to reach the finish line.At the first pages, I have to admit I was frustrated, for Jane Austen had called her characters Miss Bennet, and I must duly mention that there are five Miss Bennets. And the use of various nicknames, confused me more. I thought Elizabeth and Eliza and Lizzy are different persons. So, I put a book guide into good use as well. I must also mention my despise of Mrs. Bennet. I hated her more than anyone in this novel. She has no talent in being a mother whatsoever and have no notions of leading her daughters in the right path. The only thing that matters to her is the marrying of her five daughters. After the misfortune of Lydia running away with Wickham, she was frivolous as to forget the elopement as soon as news of marriage were ensued. She considered the hunting for a wedding gown, the most of her problems. I've never seen a woman as fickle-minded as her and no one as blinded to riches than her. Nor do I have a desire to meet one.Lydia Bennet, is another matter. She is selfish and insensitive as anyone can get. I have to mention this, to unload the hatred in my chest.How Jane and Elizabeth turned out to be well bred is a wonder, considering the type of mother they are born with.But enough of what I hate of the book, because it will soon be forgotten, and all but the love of Mr Darcy for Elizabeth would remain.This is a genuine love story. I've fallen in love with Mr Darcy. He wanted to change his ways for his beloved Elizabeth. He helped her in so many ways and he needed no credit for it. For him, it was enough that he knew he helped her. He also hid his love for her for so long, its endearing.No part of the book was useless. All were vital for the fruition of Mr Darcy and Ms Bennett's love story. As you go deeper in the book, all pieces come together, like a puzzle, slowly making meaning.Indeed, Ms. Elizabeth Bennet is lucky, to have loved and to be loved in return. Despite the troubles their love had to endure, it was victor in the end. ?",en
692,84979,227027862,it was ok,"18 chapters in... I want that to sink in for a moment... ok. 18 chapters in and NOTHING has happened. I am enjoying her writing style very much, but I also enjoy the back of an occasional cereal box so that may not mean much. We will see.I am sitting here eating a tootsie roll, a Halloween left over, and I can't help notice the similarities between it and the novel Pride and Prejudice. First off, like P and P, the tootsie roll wasn't one of those dinky ones that you can almost swallow in a single bite so you know that I've been at this for a while and now that I finally got it down, I have to wonder why I put it into mouth to begin with. Secondly, tootsie rolls are a throwback to another age, there are far better candies out there and the 36 wrappers littering the floor will attest to this. You have to really like tootsie rolls to appreciate them. I don't.Pride and Prejudice is the dullest most wonderfully written book that I have ever read. I read it simply to get a feel for the author's fantastic ability at arranging words, and really I mean it when I say, oh what wonderful blather.I give the book one star. After 62 chapters, there is nothing that happens. There is barely a story to the story, at least not one that could be remotely interesting...even to people who like romance. In the age of bodices, there is nary a one that is ripped open, let alone one that is undone with the gentle exploring fingers of a lover. And then there is the hubbub over the book...Satirical? A witty comedy of manners? Sure, I smiled a few times at the only funny character in the book, Mr. Bennett, but overall, I read, studied the sentence structure, noticed the wall paper and waited patiently as the paint dried. Even the dramatic ending where Lizzy gets the guy, is a letdown and dull. Just to let you know, I was joking about it being in any way dramatic. Which brings me to the characters. Other than Lizzy, they are all stereotypical and lack even the most remote concept of depth. Jane is pretty and sweet from the first page to the last. The mom is overbearing, the dad aloof. Other than Darcy, no one grows or changes in a book that spans a few years and endless pages.Normally, I use one star for books that I just can't finish and if I wasn't an aspiring author, I wouldn't have bothered to get through half the book, but since I did... and when I compare it to yawner like A Tale of Two Cities, I had to bump this one up a notch.PS, Don't read Moby Dick either, if you know what's good for you.",en
693,84979,320,it was amazing,"So the other day Elizabeth and I are in the book store and she saw this book, and said she really wanted me to read it. In horror at the thought of reading what I thought was a 'chick book', i immediately countered that she would then have to read one of my favorites: Dune. She agreed!So I read it, and I have to admit, it was good - damn good. Even though there was a serious lack of any gratuitous violence, I tore through it in several days. Austen is an amazing writer, and has a particular talent for explaining her characters deep motivations (or prejudices) in a few defining sentences.I think my favorite part of it is the unwinding of Elizabeths' prejudices against Mr Darcy. It is done so slowly and artfully and believably that the reader is completely pulled into the story.  It is a definite period piece - here are a few funny observations:- Nobody in the book had a job - they all earned income from their estates- Since nobody had jobs they spent all day gossiping- People were judged not by what they did for a living but what family they were from and how they behaved in society. Completely different from today!- Dating was much tougher back then. You needed at least 10 dates to get anywhere, and you probably had to marry in order to go all the way.Jokes aside, this is a classic, and I highly recommend it for any guy or girl.",en
694,84979,924672703,it was amazing,"Just a few words to express how I loved Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. So much has already been said, that I feel almost redundant. 'Pride and Prejudice' for me is above all about women’s choices in marriage, or the possibility of love versus choosing for money or social position. During Austen's time, marriage was the only option a woman had, except if she was rich enough to disregard the expectations of society; except if she was willing to live as a poor relation, which usually meant being used as an unpaid servant. Of course, there was always the option of becoming a governess, but that represented not only miserly wages, even worst it implied becoming barely respectable and existence in an ambiguous class oblivion of social invisibility and no autonomy. What could be worst? Thus, let’s not criticize Austen’s contemporaries who saw marriage as their only choice, let’s even try to understand Mrs. Benet predicament:
”If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
But we have to remember that woman’s necessity was not one-sided:
 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
But, alas, that has probably been said before. What else can I mention here? That Jane Austen was ahead of her time, and her heroine, the witty and charming Elizabeth Bennet, makes us fall in love with her by her accurate view of the world: 
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.
And let’s not forget Mr. Darcy, for I am a romantic at heart, and he conquered me with his truthful statement, and even more crucial for me, ended up changing for Elizabeth:
In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
What I most liked about Elizabeth and Darcy’s relationship is that it is not a simple romantic tale, but I loved how they overcome his pride and her prejudice and grow up gradually from a mutual antipathy to an understanding. And that does not happen overnight but over a period of over a year.All this, and much more if I wished to be even more redundant is what makes this novel so popular and enduring. It was refreshing to have a story that despite questioning prevailing values makes us smile. Highly recommended.____",en
695,84979,492283414,it was amazing,"Often imitated, never matched. Nobody can do it quite like Jane Austen.True story: I was rummaging through and throwing away lots of my old papers and souvenirs a few weeks ago and happened to run across my 30+ year old notes from a college course where we studied Pride and Prejudice. I can't believe I still had them! Some of those P&P notes were actually pretty insightful, so in this review I've included some of the more interesting observations from my long-ago class. Hope you enjoy! From the first tongue-in-cheek words:It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.Austen brilliantly sets up the world of this novel. Marriage - however humorous the personalities and events may be - is serious business. And when the Bennets have five daughters and no sons, the seriousness of getting their girls married off increases exponentially. The desperation of the marriage hunt is really the desperation of economic survival. Mrs Bennet has that essentially right, however misguided she is in the way she goes about it. The theme of self-discovery works hand-in-hand with the theme of marriage, and the tension between economic interest and romantic feelings. Both pride and prejudice are obstacles not just to understanding others, but to knowing oneself. Elizabeth learns about herself from several other characters along the way: Wickham: (view spoiler)[the danger of trusting solely in appearance. (hide spoiler)]Charlotte: (view spoiler)[the danger of too much practicality and making decisions based on material reasons. (hide spoiler)]Lady Catherine: (view spoiler)[helps Elizabeth to see Darcy's pride in perspective (hide spoiler)]Jane Austen shows us so many different types of marriages in P&P: those based mostly on initial physical attraction ((view spoiler)[the Bennet parents as well as Lydia and Wickham (hide spoiler)]), those based on practical, material considerations; those based on emotional feeling and compatibility ((view spoiler)[Jane and Bingley (hide spoiler)]). And finally, and very gradually, we progress to seeing relationships based on reason and intelligence as well as physical and emotional attraction. The Gardiners are the model here, and the type of marriage Elizabeth wants to have for herself.I adore Elizabeth and Darcy, working through their flaws (there's pride and prejudice aplenty on both sides!), willing to reconsider earlier judgments, tentatively working their way toward each other. And when you combine that with Austen's insight into human foibles and her sharp wit, every page is a pleasure. Sometimes I've been guilty of rushing through P&P, skimming over some chapters to get to the ""good parts"" faster, but I took my time this time around, reading it slower and more carefully, and was rewarded accordingly.P&P is my favorite book of Jane Austen's ... and very possibly my favorite book of all time. It's the perfect mix of intelligence, humor and romance.Bonus! A studious and completely objective discussion of the merits of the leading actors and actresses in the major P&P movies and TV miniseries. First up: The Elizabeth Bennet actresses.First, Greer Garson from the 1940 movie:… no, for two big reasons: 1. As  one website points out, “Garson's [Elizabeth Bennet] was smirking, empty-headed and flirtatious where Ehle's was smirking, strong and intelligent."" Hah!2. Hoop skirts. Hoop. Skirts. A thousand times no! (This movie also has a third strike against it, the travesty of its rewriting of Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s personality.)Second, Elizabeth Garvie in the 1980 BBC miniseries: She’s not well known except among P&P fans, but she actually does a very nice job with Lizzie.Jennifer Ehle from the 1995 miniseries:She’s great, and she gets extra points for just how well she plays off of Colin Firth, but I have a fundamental problem with Ehle, which is that she just doesn’t match my vision of Lizzie. I just can’t entirely buy her in the part. Keira Knightley:Very pretty but … too pretty. And man, is she wearing a lot of makeup in some of the scenes.Honorable mention: Aishwarya Rai in Bride and Prejudice (I don’t even care if she’s too gorgeous):So for me, it’s Elizabeth Garvie, but kind of in a default win. Part II: The Darcys:We begin with Lawrence Olivier from the 1940 Hollywood movie:... all props to Sir Lawrence, but he's not my vision of Darcy.David Rintoul from the 1980 BBC version:... who is a pretty good Darcy, actually; it's not his fault that the production values in this P&P version suck. (it's basically like watching a theater play that's been filmed)On to the wonderful Colin Firth, from the seminal 1995 miniseries:... I can't help it, he makes my heart beat faster even when he's not in a wet shirt.Matthew Macfadyen in the 2005 movie:Sorry to his fans, but he doesn't cut it for me. He always looks So. Worried!So clearly for me it's Colin Firth FTW, but feel free to argue with me in the thread. :)Honorable mentions go to Elliot Cowan in Lost in Austen and Martin Henderson in Bride and Prejudice.

""...Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.

Go Jane - like a cute little tortoise you have outlasted all of those bustling hares.****It is a truth which I would like to see universally acknowledged, that no one voluntarily reads any 19th century novels unless they are by Jane Austen. I fear that modern readers think all these Radcliffes, Disraelis, Eliots, Gissings and so forth tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt them, or even, that they are most disagreeable, horrid books, not at all worth reading. They look at them without admiration at the library. They tell me they are all too long, but for my own part, if a book is well written, I always find it too short. But it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first, lest it be considered prejudice. Such perseverance in wilful self-deception! In vain I have struggled to tell them about Thackeray, Dickens and Bennett. It will not do. Somewhere they have formed the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I firmly believe that Moby Dick is the last book in the world that they could ever be prevailed on to read. The modern reader is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who is either a vampire, or a zombie, is sure of being kindly spoken of. Well, well. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.

703,84979,38425918,it was amazing,"Will I read Pride and Prejudice again? Yes, a thousand times, yes!Near perfection! P & P is one of those rare gems that weds character, plot and language all in one harmonious marriage. Austen's plotting is so very precise here. It's an absolute pleasure to behold. The timing is impeccable and there is very little, if any, fat in the prose to slow it down. Finding new clues to future plot twists and turns with each reread has reached the level of a sport for me now! They say, write what you know. Austen knew the life of the upper class (more precisely, the lower ranks of the upper class). She knew all about sitting around in parlors waiting to one day possibly be wed. She knew the rules of engagement that her class and gender imposed upon her. And so she wrote about those things and wrote well, weaving complex love triangles in a realistic, down-to-earth style. Some readers, often American, complain that Austen's work is tedious and unimpassioned. They are annoyed by characters that do not speak out or act when action would resolve the problems that arise in the social situations that make up the basis of Austen's stories. They lose sight of the fact that the early 19th century is not early 21st. Heck, it's not even the same country. To some living 200 years after Austen published, these sensibilities do not readily make sense. You must understand that the basis of Austen's writing is founded upon the mores of her time.What makes P & P  so exciting and intriguing is that our protagonist does push back, she does speak out. She does all those things we modern day readers wish she'd do. You just have to read very carefully to see it all happening. It's occasionally quite subtle, but it's there. A familiarity with early 19th century England, its language and customs will help unveil this novel's beauty and brilliance.While I would not have wanted to be a woman living then, essentially tied down and utterly reliant on a wealthy man's whim for my happiness or even salvation, I try to at least enjoy the spectacle of something absolutely foreign to the way I live. Watching these people in the midst of arguing or courting is much like watching the controlled chaos of a boxing match. The principle parties are dueling like fighters looking to beat the crap out of one another, yet under strict rules by which they are bound. Break the rules and you may be disqualified. The constraints these people put themselves under in the name of civility may seem fanciful to us outsiders, but for a woman whose very livelihood depended on winning this bizarre game, it was very real.(Reviews of film and television adaptations to come!)",en

Mrs.Bennet is always looking for eligible prospects since so many are in the military and the militia is nearby, that's where Mrs. Bennet looks mainly, officers only of course. The two youngest sisters, teenagers, already make daily, secret visits to the regimental headquarters, but Jane is 22 and Elizabeth 20! Time is quickly running out, when a gentleman Mr.Charles Bingley rents the Netherfield house and brings his wealthy friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy, both bachelors, with money ( this is 1813 we have to be quite formal), things are looking up in the village, for the Bennet family. At the assembly Bingley dances twice with Jane, the prettiest daughter, and Darcy's perceived pride towards the lowly provincials, makes him very disliked by Elizabeth (still sparks fly ) the smartest of the sisters, that's where the book title comes from (now Mr.George Wickham, what a charming, splendid man, everyone thinks). When these two unattached gentlemen leave for London town, all hope sinks, will they ever comeback? After Mr.Collins, the unknown cousin visits the home of the Bennet's, an uneasy feeling hangs heavy over the whole family. Mr.William Collins, the pompous, irritating clergyman, surprisingly proposes to Miss Elizabeth, her mother approves but will the daughter ? The advantages are obvious but the independent woman has a strong streak of following her dreams and what about Mr. Darcy? Is she changing her opinion about that arrogant man, a woman's prerogative.... Celebrating this year,the 200th anniversary of the all time classic. A wonderful, amusing, charming, warm story about never giving in to expediency but follow your dreams, no matter how remote the possibility of success, sometimes you wake up, and it becomes reality.",en
705,84979,364800436,it was amazing,"This was actually a reread for me, I just didn't actively use GR when I read it before!Man I really love Jane Austen. I still don't think this has topped Sense & Sensibility as my favorite, but it's still so GOOD!I think the book does a better job of portraying Darcy in a different light than the 2005 movie, you can actually see his affections changing through some dialogue that isn't in that movie, and you can also see a bit more of the fault of Elizabeth for her prejudiced thoughts against him. It helps the narrative a bit more since he is less portrayed as a bad boy with a heart of gold, and rather as someone who is misrepresented & makes mistakes. Lots of other things to talk about - bingley is as precious a cinnamon roll as ever (as is Jane) and mr Bennet is still one of my all time favorite fictional characters.I just love this book a lot.

708,84979,1643495969,it was amazing,"I had forgotten just how witty this novel is. And how key reticence is to the plot. In particular Elizabeth’s, in stark contrast with her mother who shoots off her mouth at every opportunity with a vulgarity that constantly has one squirming on Elizabeth’s behalf. Elizabeth is like the family editor, the family censor. It’s her who receives most of the critical information in the novel and very rarely does she share it. I often found myself puzzling why. In an age when women were largely silenced it seemed odd that Elizabeth voluntarily silenced herself. But it also made me keenly aware at times of how much human nature – or maybe female social decorum - has changed. When Elizabeth finds out why Bingley has dumped her sister she doesn’t tell her sister. I’m pretty sure all of us now would be on the phone to our sisters in a jiffy. Clearly Austen didn’t find this a strange decision; in fact she breezes over the disclosure so swiftly it’s as if she assumes the reader would perfectly understand Elizabeth’s motive without any explanation. Maybe Elizabeth’s extreme reticence was a plot device, a very effective one to be sure because it enables Darcy to remain mysterious and it even enables Elizabeth to remain mysterious to herself. It’s super clever of Austen to refer to Darcy as proud throughout the novel when in fact it’s Elizabeth who is the more entrenched culprit of that emotional stance. It’s largely her pride that creates the atmosphere of prejudice around Darcy. It’s also a novel that makes you miss being in love. As much for all the anxiety, embarrassment, keyed-up second guessing, girly gossiping/speculation and ghastly self-consciousness as the elation and well-being.In short, I loved it again and found it didn’t matter one iota that I knew what was coming. Only brilliant writing and craftsmanship can sustain dramatic tension when you know what is going to happen next.As a footnote when I was seventeen my mother told me I needed to develop the Elizabeth in my nature and curb the Lydia. Thing is, the Lydia type has more kudos now than she had in Austen’s time. Psychotherapy would probably argue for a balance between the impulsive Lydia and editorial Elizabeth as a model of behaviour. You sense Austen held a similar view. ",en
709,84979,1260483002,it was amazing,"In view of creating a more pleasant atmosphere, I strongly suggest you read the following review AND the book itself with the most elegant, articulate British accent!***This is by far the best classic literature I’ve read!!!***To begin with, Pride and Prejudice mainly surrounded several families and relatives of the Bennets, depicting their second daughter, Elizabeth’s, love story and all the turning points until she met and settled with Mr. Handsome Darcy. To my surprise, there weren’t many characters in this book as I expected, as a result, it was a piece of cake to remember every one of them since they all possessed some features that were pretty memorable. Thanks to the author’s vivid descriptions, I could effortlessly picture the entire image in my mind throughout the story. Also, according to the title of the book, it’s not hard to tell that our Mr. Darcy had a distinguishable personality of pride and a bit indifference when judging from a stranger to him, whereas our dear Elizabeth held a certain level of prejudice toward him in that she wasn’t familiar with him at first. 
”What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
Anyway, this is a highly-praised masterpiece about 
a man changed his manners and a young lady changed her mind.
”There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”“And your defect is a propensity to hate every body.”“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand them.”
Let’s start from the beginning, shall we? We got a detailed definition from Lizzy’s younger sister, Mary, of an essential respect in humanity, pride, and that was how everything concerning Mr. Darcy all originated. So, what is pride? 
”Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.”
As for prejudice, since Lizzy’s knowledge of Mr. Darcy primarily learned from her gossiping mother, Mrs. Bennet, who, in my opinion, was a really superficial person because she knew nothing more than rumours and automatically spread the word or implanted falsehoods of him to Lizzy. Therefore, half of the book described how poor Lizzy showed little respect to him and avoided conversation with him, though she was extremely curious about this guy who seemed like not caring to spare a dance with any fair lady in a ball in the meanwhile. ”I dare say you will find him very agreeable.””Heaven forbid!--That would be the greatest misfortune of all!—To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!—Do not wish me such an evil.”
Despite the fact that they sounded like an impossible pair in the story, during their encounters with each other, either by accident or under utter reluctance, there’s no denying that even in their as-short-as-possible conversation, epic humour never extinguished. 
(Mr. Darcy:)”Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.”“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.—We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
AND their next subject was as funny as this one. I could totally feel the tension and Lizzy’s uncontrollable excitement even though she pretended to be completely uninterested. 
""What think you of books?"" said he, smiling. ""Books -- Oh! no. -- I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."" ""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. -- We may compare our different opinions."" ""No -- I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.""
See? Isn’t it obvious they were both trying to ”open their lips” as if they had nothing else to do? However, with one almost blinded with pride and the other followed simply by her predisposition, no success was made. Mercifully, once upon a time Mr. Darcy finally took a step closer to Lizzy, and was the first to proceed with little talks! Here’s one when Lizzy was invited to a walk by Miss Bingley, who made lots of endeavor to win Darcy over, and he came out of nowhere and bumped into them. 
”I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first, I should be completely in your way;--and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire.""
I think the twists and turns in this book were always quick and concise, for example, some intense moments or incidents were mentioned in just a few sentences but the consequence played an indispensable role, yet they usually developed rather slowly. Another reason that made this book unputdownable is the connection among characters. That is, speaking of Mr. Collins or Mr. Wickham, my mind would wander to Mr. Darcy(well, not the usual kind of wandering!) and wonder where he was at that specific timing. Take Lady Catherine for another example, when she showed up and spent some time with the Bennet family, I couldn’t stop thinking what Mrs. Bennet was doing then(since she was MIA sometimes, and ”always”, when I finally paid attention to her). Above all, you can see my reading progress below?and that basically explains why I spent more than a week on this book. At about 50% of the book, I feel the urge to admit that the chemistry between our lovely Lizzy and Mr. Darcy was practically killing me. A part of me really wanted to burst their romantic bubbles but a part of me couldn’t resist the temptation of witnessing more of their half-awkward, half-humourous reaction. Eventually, the latter part of myself stood up and see what I got. 
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.
As their relationship gradually formed, I was pretty sure the previous waiting was worthwhile and as I said before, the plot indeed went sweetly nice and slow. Even in that period of time, around late 17th and early 18th century, confession between two might-be-in-love people could be as beautiful and bold as the declaration of love these days. And that’s why I think the readers can resonate so much from this story. 
”In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.”
Apart from the romance or the marriages of other family members, there’s another point I truly appreciated. Jane Austen’s way of telling stories was quite impressive in that her words not only reflected on the social conditions in her time but were applicable to the situations nowadays. We know that Pride and Prejudice isn’t just about some cliché love stories or cheesy plots; there are far more serious facts in it, including negative sides of humanity, societal problems, and inequality of personal bias. So when I read this, I could possibly relate to some of her perspectives/statements because what she pointed out were too realistic to deny. 
”who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.”
I do believe what she meant by wickedness here can reasonably expand to other aspects in reality, such as any unmoral deeds or impossible behaviors among human beings, just to name a few.With the end of the story approaching, as one of my statuses implied, this book made me become the happiest person on Earth! That was when I read this simple paragraph, and it wasn’t simple at all! The power and meaning behind those words were exceedingly exciting for me; this kind of feeling was definitely beyond Homo sapiens languages. 
”Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?””This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire, --splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.”
If you don’t know where this is, I even took a picture at that moment merely because I was too happy to not sharing the joy with you. Hmm…at least there’s the context so perhaps you’ll better get it(?) As a result of these irresistible characteristics along with his sparkling charisma, no wonder he was voted as the most ideal husband in the United Kingdom!Okay, we’re almost ‘til the end, but I really, really, really still have countless quotes and thoughts to express! Ugh, why do I always come up with even more ideas whenever I ponder deeply on those quotes? *screaming quietly* Anyway, it was absolutely priceless to see our beloved Prince Handsome exclaim the following speech and I was more than willing to let him melt my heart once again. 
”…Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”
Don’t go away yet, people! We haven’t seen how Lizzy responded to his once-in-a-lifetime-kind-of-sweet-speech! Well, though she never accepted nor rejected him in public, I’m positive that most of you know the ending but how can we not say goodbye to her one last time? I certainly miss her undying humour now. 
”Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your’s.”
 Please do continue this part of the book! Not quoting it here or else there’ll be no fun in reading this! All in all, Pride and Prejudice is undoubtedly an amazing book and a must-read in life! It not only contains the funny banters in that period but also brings out the natural beauty of English vocabularies, spellings, and grammar. Even if I was not a big fan of Classics, this book surprises me a lot and I think it changes my stereotypical fear for the genre. Now I’m actually eager to read some more books from Classic Literature!******Finis*****The following section is just my personal opinion which isn’t related to the book, not really.Comparison among Jane Austen and the BrontësWhile reading this one, I can’t help but comparing Jane Austen to Charlotte Brontë(author of Jane Eyre) and Emily Brontë(author of Wuthering Heights). The three of them lived in a similar era, yet their writing styles as well as the presentation of their stories not only gave us completely different feelings but various insights into the obviously contrary backgrounds at that time. Pride and Prejudice talked of a common phenomenon of matching marriage and ended happily, with some British humour thereupon, while the counterpart of romance in Jane Eyre was bittersweet, regardless of the heart-wrenching happy ending; needless to say, the love in Wuthering Heights was much more twisted, heartbroken, and the characters still suffered a lot no matter how much love they invested in each other simply because of the gap in social statuses. This kind of variety indeed intrigues me a lot and thus I read the appendix in the last part of the book, which gave me better understanding and interpretation of Pride and Prejudice. For starters, I totally agree with the introducer of the original version, Tony Tanner’s, briefing of the historical background when the story took place, 

”For the most part the people are as fixed and repetitive as the linked routines and established social rituals which dominate their lives.""

 Precisely, I also believe that money is a potential problem(but never an actual) for them and courtship has its own drama, but whatever happened, they all tend towards the achieving of satisfactory marriages so that’s exactly the foundation Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy’s world was built on. Thus, I firmly believe both Jane Austen’s and the Brontës’ stories more or less mirrored the conditions in the past. And as a reader, I think it’s necessary to think over those issues whether out of curiosity or not.",en

""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.""
The Bennet's are one such family with five unmarried daughters and the family estate entailed away from the female line but prejudice abounds. The unexpected and sudden appearance of the eligible, rich and handsome Mr Darcy known locally for his pride and incivility and the slightly less rich but milder mannered and more even tempered Mr Bingley provokes great excitement in most if not all quarters: ""Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.""""I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all.""And so it proceeds. Will pride and prejudice prevent any satisfactory alliance?After watching the BBC TV series numerous times, I decided it was finally time to read this period classic. The BBC have done a good job in being faithful to the original work, other than the ending which is extended a lot in the book. The TV series is also very well cast and the characters represented as I'm sure the author had envisaged when writing. (I did not like the more modern movie version.)This is one of my favourite classics. I recommend it to all.",en
711,84979,646800336,it was amazing,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that an author possessing immense talent and a good story to tell, must be in want of a reader like me to bestow upon it the laurels it merits. How else will anyone hear of it?OK, so P&P may not need my help. The word is likely already out. What that means is that I can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that Miss Austen will have an audience regardless.It had been quite a while since I’d read anything written so long ago. Of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. The musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. Her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. This passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:
""Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.""
This example is also one of many instances where an air or manner was defined, or a countenance, bearing or nature. Much was read into facial expressions, too. Remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”As an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. It’s a cliché to point out that Austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. Courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. And the language was so stylized and indirect. Subtitles would make for a good skit, like in Annie Hall where Alvy is talking to Annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. Monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. Books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.There’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. Elizabeth Bennet is great. Mr. Darcy emerges. Jane and Bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. Mr. Collins is an obsequious toad. Mr. Bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. Mrs. Bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (I should have been using Miss Austen’s wording throughout. It’s not like I could improve upon it.) Lydia is heedless and Wickham is evil. Of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” The whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. Yes, and it’s told really well. It’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.I’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a review by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of P&P characters. Pish posh you say? Well hear me out. First of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. They range widely over multiple dimensions. Then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. Composites are encouraged. For instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 Elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 Jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 Mrs. Bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. Then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger. ",en

713,84979,2403123288,it was amazing,"I give this book 4.5 stars which rounds up to 5.This was my second book by Jane Austen, the first being Sense and Sensibility. When I read Sense and Sensibility, I found that I liked it but wasn’t blown away by it. And given the fact that I now remember absolutely nothing about it, it didn’t leave much of an impression on me. Going into Pride and Prejudice, I didn’t know if it was going to be like that too, so I didn’t have very high expectations. Additionally, I did read an adapted version of Pride and Prejudice for kids when I was little, and I remember enjoying that but that was a watered down version written in very plain English.Fortunately, I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice a lot more than Sense and Sensibility. I loved the storyline and plot. Initially, I feared that I might get bored, but I was throughly engaged throughout the novel. There was always something of interest happening. The short chapters also helped because it made the book go by very quickly. I’m actually impressed that I finished this in less than a week because I for sure thought it would take me a least one week. I also loved the characters, the Bennet family especially. The mother was hilarious and so over the top. Elizabeth and Jane’s sisterly bond was very strong and that was so nice to see. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were also pretty awesome.As for Mr. Darcy, I have to admit I did find him to be pretty swoon-worthy. I didn’t want to fall for him because everyone loves him, but it was hard not to. Lastly, I found the book to be just a tad bit too short. I wanted more, but I guess that’s just the sign of a good book. Overall, Pride and Prejudice exceeded my expectations and I am glad that I finally read this much beloved and talked about classic.

Or if the 429 users who have shelved this book as “Chick Lit” are right, then color me Summer’s Eve because this book gets ALL THE STARS.I’m not sure that I could adequately express what I loved best about Pride and Prejudice, because there are so many things. The writing, for one, is superb. There is a flawless eloquence to Austen’s writing whereby every situation, every thought, every turn of phrase is delivered gracefully, yet with the greatest exactitude. Clunkiness does not exist here. Second, and perhaps even more compelling, are her characters. Each of them is drawn fully and completely, with qualities unique to the individual. You could, theoretically, engage in brief conversation with any of them, and without presupposing who they were, be able to identify them as this or that character based solely on account of their speech and mannerism. I wonder if people realize how difficult an undertaking that is for an author, and in my opinion it is what reveals Austen to be as accomplished a writer as I am giving her credit for.I have in the past heard this book described as a “novel of manners,” being predominantly about polite society and taking place predominantly in the drawing rooms of the landed gentry. And while I do not dispute this description, I would be hesitant to depend on it for fear of being too dismissive. Yes, this novel details the lifestyles of the well-to-do in pre-Victorian England, but it is also much more than that. It brings us characters and situations we can relate to now, in 2014. Elizabeth Bennet, a remarkable character in her own right, is aware of her rank and social standing, yet well enough adjusted to it to consider it with lesser importance than she considers other things—things like dignity, self-respect, and the treatment of others without regard to their station. She no more treats her inferiors with disdain than makes allowances for the ill behavior of the wealthy. In many ways, she’s the kind of character we’d all like to emulate, or pretend we do emulate (even though we probably don’t because most of us are assholes). And Elizabeth is self-aware. She recognizes her own failings and makes attempts to mitigate them where she can. In the end it’s Elizabeth who is responsible for this book enjoying the longevity that it does, and for the fact that modern readers find it still relevant to them. I think that is very refreshing, and that I just called a 200 year-old novel “refreshing” is in itself refreshing.But wait, there’s more!This book is loaded with humor. Austen is very subtle about it, too, but I believe her to be chiding her characters in a way that endears us to them, and I say this even about the ones we are to find reproachable. Mrs. Bennet, universally derided as ignorant and frivolous is still, at the heart of all things, a mother who wants the best for her children, though maybe not always going about it the best way. Mr. Collins, a buffoon of a man, is to a certain degree hilarious in his buffoonishness. We read his letters to the Bennet family without being able to suppress a smirk for the outrageousness of his imprudence. And even Elizabeth herself, in her manner of addressing Mr. Darcy during those occasions she believes him to be arrogant or haughty, is amusing, and we imagine Darcy to be likewise amused by her sharp tongue and curt words. I may have rejected this novel as one primarily intended for the female audience, but I am not so obstinate as to refuse to submit to its being a romance novel. It is a romance novel. And guess what? I loved it. Austen relates to us the growing esteem that two flawed people have for each other and she does it in a way that never betrays their characters. Everything that happens, happens as a result—direct or indirect—of the nature and disposition of these two characters, and yes, I did think it beautiful.",en

Book Review

So it starts off with this zombie who is thirsty for... oh wait, wrong book. I thought this had zombies in the title. I must be confused. Oh, there are 2 of them. Why would someone do that? What do zombies have to do with marriage and love and the idea of ideas? Is this the book where the women in a lion's den dislike the men? Oh, I'm so lost today with these older reviews. JUST KIDDING!3 out of 5 stars to Pride and Prejudice, a remarkable novel written in the early 19th century by the wonderful Jane Austen. I read this when I was around 20 years old, as part of one of my English courses. I like the book. I enjoy the characters. But I'm not as big of a fan as most people who say they like this book. I've also never seen any movie, film or tv series versions of it, nor would I dare pick up the one that includes the zombies. There are 2 things preventing me: (1) I wasn't enamored with this one enough to want to re-read something very different and (2) I've never been a fan of zombies. Vampires, yes. Werewolves, yes. Witches, totally. But for some reasons, zombies don't do it for me. I did like the first two movies in the Resident Evil series, but that's just because she's a badass! Why am I still talking about zombies. Let's move to marriage, a more appropriate topic, given it's a central theme in the book.I am not married. For a while, it wasn't legal for me to marry the person I'd want to marry. It is now. But I'm still not married. And I have been in a relationship for nearly six years. My point... so off topic in this one... is that marriage has never been important to me. And so this book had some interesting parts to it that I both agreed with and had some conflicts with. I believe in doing what's best for the two people involved in the relationship, not what society says is the acceptable thing to do. I also find marriage to be something more private between the married couple, and it would be weird to stand up in front of a whole room of people and say some words, have some sort of institutional approach and then continue on with our lives.I liked the pairing of Elizabeth and Darcy, but it wasn't a romantic and wonderful turn of events for me. It felt more like a societal commentary of relationships, expectations and courtship. As a result, I focused less on ""should they be together"" and more on ""what's the meaning under all these words."" I liked the book, probably give it a 3.4999999, which unfortunately rounds down to a 3. Of all the classics, it's not one of my favorites, but I'd give it another chance under the right circumstances. Just would want to maybe see a visual interpretation first, perhaps to drive my imagination and provoke some different thoughts for the next read.

719,84979,553209385,it was ok," I heartily enjoy period romance. Jane Austen's particular style of writing, however, leaves me a bit cold.It's a rule that writers are supposed to write what they know. If Austen stayed true to that rule, I really feel bad for her. Because she must have known nothing but shallow, self-absorbed, slightly idiotic people.While the sisters Bronte were capable of creating characters that even today's reader can identify with (complete with passion and realistic, heart-warming flaws), Austen's characters are devoid of any depth whatsoever. They all just seem to be flitting through life with one goal in mind; for the men, finding a woman who's easy on the eyes, and for the women, finding a man who's heavy on the bank.Now, I'll concede that Austen was technically a good writer, but that doesn't mean her stories were interesting, engrossing, or even slightly entertaining. In fact, I found that I had to force myself to finish Pride and Prejudice, and was fueled mostly by a deep resentment and anger for having even started it in the first place. ""If this is how it begins"", I thought to myself, ""How pissed am I going to be by the end?""The answer? Pretty pissed.I made the mistake of reading this book after watching the 2005 movie version starring Keira Knightley. Big mistake. While the movie was sigh-inducing with its romance, the book reads like a 19th century woman's guide to bagging a rich husband. The final scene, where Darcy finally proposes to Elizabeth, was something I was looking forward to with cautious trepidation, cautious trepidation that ended up being well-founded; two people bartering over a used car would have been more romantic.",en
720,84979,1963843942,it was amazing,"“There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.” This is one of those books that, beyond comprehension and against all odds, can be said to embody, as perfectly as reasonably (im)possible, the concept of immortality.It's no secret that I love and worship Jane Austen to the end of the world and back, but what I'd like to highlight here and what most struck me in this re-reading (it seems that in each it's something always different that inexplicably captivates my attention) is the astonishing modernity of this text. Some lines, especially of the dialogues, could as well have been written yesterday, and no one would be the wiser.
“Your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand them.” “I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.” “We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”
The liveliness and freshness of Austen's writing style (ans story, and ideas, and characters, and just about everything else) is but one piece of the enormous puzzle that could give you an exact and precise picture of the reason why said what I said at the beginning: this text is immortal. It has no age and I can't foresee a time when it will start to grow old. It has modernity written all over it, and you can add that to the list of the reasons why you want it in your shelves, and in your heart, and in your brain.I'll give you the next at the next re-reading. ",en
721,84979,18611993,it was amazing,"For a lover of books, I came to Pride and Prejudice (P&P from now on) very, very, very late.The reasons are myriad: my mother hated Austen (a disdain she took to the grave without ever explaining), so she never recommended her to me; I was a boy in the '70s and a teen in the '80s and even though I loved Barbra Streisand, ABBA, Wham!, Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran (and...yes...I still do) I wasn't about to let people know that, and since I carried whatever book I was reading with me wherever I went, I wasn't about to let myself get caught in possession of a literary chick flick; I played tons of D&D and there's no room for P&P when you're busy writing new spells and fragging Orcs with exploding eggs; and when I began studying literature in earnest, in my undergrad years, I was more taken with the Lost Generation than any other generation, so I spent most of my time steeped in the early-Twentieth Century.I finally bumped into Ms. Austen in grad school. I took a course that covered all her novels, but even there I skipped over P&P. The reading list was her entire body of work, and the A&E P&P miniseries, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle -- which remains an excellent adaptation of P&P -- was big at the time; it saved me from having to read P&P along with S and S and E and P and NA and MP. I took part in the P&P discussions, albeit sparingly, and wrote my papers on E and P, eschewing P&P for the books I knew well. But P&P wasn't about to let me off that easily. You see...my wife was a former stage manager turned accountant who wanted to get back into theatre, and one of the profs at school was putting on Love's Labour's Lost. There was a bit of an emergency, and she put out a call to the entire grad community for a stage manager, with any level of skill, to save the production. Enter my wife (who is an amazing stage manager). I gave her the heads up; she became the s.m.; two weeks later I found myself rushing to learn the lines and blocking for Nathaniel to save the show from a second emergency, and suddenly I was an actor. I was actually pretty darn good (I have only recently bowed out of the craft), and I found myself cast as Mr. Darcy early the following year. Now I had to read P&P.So I did. And I read Bridget Jones's Diary. And I watched every version of P&P I could get my hands on. And I grew out my mutton chops. And I learned how to dance. And I improved my posture. And I had the most miserable time I have ever had on stage anywhere. My Elizabeth and I grew to loathe one another (I have never worked with a more selfish actress). Our director cast herself in a fairly important role and lost track of actually directing, so the performances were terribly imbalanced. The play adaptation we were working from was butchered beyond recognition, which horrified the writer in me as the playwright was never consulted. And the rehearsals were utterly excruciating.But that acting gig gave me some great things too. It gave me one of my finest moments on stage (I fell off the thrust in the middle of my first dance with Elizabeth, climbed back on stage and rejoined the dance, never missing a line or breaking character. Whew!) It gave me my first leading role and the confidence that comes along with that. It made me a better playwright (showing me what was actually doable); it made me a better director (teaching me what not to do when in charge of a show); it gave me some everlasting friendships; and, despite all the impediments thrown up by the play, it made me love P&P.These days I teach P&P every semester or two, and it gets better every time I read it. My twins, now 6, recently watched the mini series for the first time, and they, too, have fallen in love with Darcy and Elizabeth. P&P looks to continue its popularity well beyond my lifetime, and there are few books that deserve such sustained readership as P&P. It's one of the greats. No doubt about it.",en

724,84979,2405254608,liked it,"Hace un tiempo atrás tuve la suerte de ser uno de los cinco ganadores de un concurso organizado por Penguin Clásicos en Facebook en el que uno tenía que decir cuál había sido el primer libro clásico que había leído. El premio era un lote de los cinco libros más votados y un mes después recibí en mi casa ""Don Quijote de la Mancha"" de Miguel de Cervantes, ""Cumbres borrascosas"" de Emily Brontë, ""La isla del tesoro"" de Robert Louis Stevenson, ""Crimen y Castigo"" de Fiódor Dostoievski y éste de Jane Austen que curiosamente Penguin nunca publicó en Argentina.Como soy un lector de clásicos es lógico que me debía una lectura de ""Orgullo y prejuicio"" dado que era el único de los cinco que no había leído.No quisiera que los amantes de los libros de Jane Austen se enojen conmigo, pero realmente, la lectura se me hizo más pesada que las mil páginas de ""La montaña mágica"" (libro que realmente disfruté) y me dio la impresión que este libro es una enorme redundancia de quinientas páginas y lo que más me sorprendió era que la temática queda siempre clavada en los acercamientos y desengaños amorosos de dos de las cinco hijas del señor y la señora Bennet, agravado por las pacatas costumbres de la sociedad victoriana que mantenía férreamente atada las pasiones de las damas de esa época.Todo gira siempre en lo mismo: en una carrera entre las chicas solteras de distintas clases sociales por ganarse el amor de un apuesto joven que oh casualidad, es millonario y está a la caza de una dote que le asegure futuro y posición social.Los diálogos me resultaron anodinos y redundantes y responden a los caprichos y vanidades de jovencitas virginales que idealizan el amor pero que no lo consiguen. Los hombres no se quedan atrás y Austen los dota de frivolidad y machismo para vapulear a las damas a su antojo.De las cinco hermanas Bennet son Elizabeth y Jane las que acaparan más páginas, dejando atrás a Mary, Kitty y Lydia. Tal vez ya no estoy para leer este tipo de novelas y en ciertos momentos me pregunté si era necesario perder el tiempo leyéndola habiendo tantos autores interesantes, pero, a sabiendas de que era un regalo, un premio, hice el esfuerzo.Y naturalmente, me fue imposible no comparar ""Orgullo y prejuicio"" con verdaderas novelas románticas de peso como ""Cumbres borrascosas"" o ""Jane Eyre"" e incluso con ""Agnes Grey"". Siento que Jane Austen no consigue plasmar en sus personajes lo que las hermanas Brontë lograban con creces en los suyos.Para ser sincero: Elizabeth Bennet no es Jane Eyre y El Sr. Darcy dista mucho de acercarse al Sr. Rochester, mientras que el malvado Sr. Wickham se encuentra a años luz de un personaje tan fuerte como Heathcliff en ""Cumbres borrascosas"".Los forcejeos amorosos de Elizabeth Bennet con el Sr. Darcy o la relación de Jane con Charles Bingley se tornan redundantes y cuando a Austen se le agotan, utiliza el plan B de la huida de la pequeña Lydia con el Sr. Wickham. Me da la sensación que a este libro le sobran al menos ciento cincuenta páginas.De todos modos, debo reconocer que el personaje de Elizabeth Bennet está muy bien logrado por Austen, aunque no tenga ni el temple de Jane Eyre ni la tenacidad de Agnes Grey y esto es innegable para mí. Como anticipé, lamento esto que escribo que pueda generar rechazo en los lectores más entusiastas de Jane Eyre pero me gusta decir la verdad. Algo similar me pasó con ""Nueve cuentos"" de J.D. Salinger al que considero muy flojo así también como no pienso leer ""Lolita"" de Vladimir Nabokov, escritor que detesto por escribir una novela que fomenta la pedofilia e incluso la pederastia. Un escritor que se hizo famoso por un golpe bajo como lo es ""Lolita"" y que además reniega de los padres más importantes de la literatura rusa que son aquellos de los que aprendió a escribir.Pero volviendo a ""Orgullo y prejuicio"", considero que está bien escrito, pero no es ni brillante ni alcanza niveles sublimes más allá de algunas frases inteligentes que me encontré por ahí. De todas maneras, dista mucho de la soberbia técnica narrativa utilizada por de cualquiera de las hermanas Brontë.Hace mucho, cuando leí ""Cumbres borrascosas"" dejé bien en claro que elegiría ese libro antes que cualquiera de los de Jane Austen y ahora lo confirmo. Más aún: Charlotte Brontë dijo una vez sobre ""Orgullo y prejuicio"": ""¿Por qué le gusta tantísimo la señora Austen? Eso me tenía desconcertada... No había leído Orgullo y prejuicio hasta que leí esa frase suya: entonces lo hice. ¿Y qué descubrí? El daguerrotipo preciso de un rostro corriente; un jardín bien cercado y bien cuidado, pero ninguna mirada de una fisonomía brillante y viva, ni campo abierto ni aire fresco, ni colina azul ni hermoso arroyo. No me gustaría vivir con sus damas y caballeros, en sus casas elegantes pero cerradas"".Por alguna razón, la descripción de la sociedad inglesa que utiliza Jane Austen desprestigia de alguna manera a las mujeres de su época, que con excepción de Elizabeth o Jane son tontas, frívolas y demasiado inocentes. y por esta razón con cuerdo con Charlotte Brontë.Mark Twain fue mucho más lapidario todavía, afirmando sin piedad ni contemplación: ""Cada vez que leo Orgullo y prejuicio de Jane Austen, me entran ganas de desenterrarla y golpearle el cráneo con su propia tibia"".Tal vez esta última frase sea demasiado cruel para una de las escrioras más importantes de la literatura inglesa, aunque proviniendo de la ironía de Mark Twain puede ser considerada hasta graciosa.No siempre se pueden adular libros por más que se los considere ""clásicos"".Originalmente pensé en adjudicarle dos estrellas, pero considerando que unas pocas salvedades como el enardecido contrapunto entre Elizabeth y Lady Catherine de Bourg repuntan una lectura que por momentos me aburrió bastante le daré tres estrellas y aunque pido mis disculpas a quienes admiran a Jane Austen, dejo bien sentada mi posición sobre ""Orgullo y prejuicio"".",es

Mrs. Bennett is the perfect example of a busy body mother without much refinement who is worried about the fate of her three daughters. She brings many a groan with her brash words and emotional outbursts, but still manages to bring a smile to your face when you understand how much she loves her children and truly wants the best for them.A lovely story about misconceptions, miscommunication and a happy ending all wrapped into one.

1. An acquisition of years, i.e., age.2. No strong objection towards the concept of marriage.
I first read this a year ago and couldn't finish it. To say my feelings were strong is an understatement. In a passionate review I referred to marriage as ""a crapshoot"", along with any other criticism I could offer from my limited knowledge of the plot. I received a slew of comments, half of which questioned my taste and half of which pitied my hatred towards marriage. My feelings towards this book was cause for heated debate online and offline. Why ever should I bother with it again?It's hard to pinpoint, but I suppose I viewed this book as a challenge to be met. I read this expecting to feel the same as before, but like Elizabeth's change of heart towards Darcy, I too, have felt a change of heart towards this book.Although my rating is higher than before, I still have a couple of objections. The writing style still wasn't completely enjoyable for me. Despite the relatively short length of the book, the prose makes reading a page take way longer than usual. The pacing also makes the story dawdle at times. Most importantly, even though I could see that there was emotion between the characters, the style of writing made them appear somewhat insipid at times.All things aside, I think this is a good book. Does my mom's observation ring true for me? It's debatable. I'm not sure if a year made a world of difference. Although I'm not nearly so cynical, I'm still not a big proponent of marriage. Who knows though, maybe one day I'll get married and then you can laugh. In the meantime, don't tell me about it.",en

734,84979,1557778241,really liked it,"I hope Jane Austen is somewhere up there and that, even in death, she knows that Elizabeth Bennett is still That Bitch in 2019. 
“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”
Pride and Prejudice is one of those books that comes with the ""everyone who has a literature degree should have read this"" stamps and I am, in fact, doing a literature degree. The sheer amount of times this has been referenced in the course of my degree definitely made me think I should read it. The good news is, everyone seems to love this book. Even people who don't really like classics. And guess what? The hype was right because I kinda love it tooPride and Prejudice is an excellent social commentary delving into the tenuous economic positions women in the 19th century held. Mrs Bennett's desperate scramble to marry off her daughters, particularly Jane and Elizabeth, as soon as the eligible bachelors Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy wander into town provides for an entertaining and often hilarious tale but it's also dire in that throughout the novel you are well aware that the sisters face potential poverty and homelessness should they not find good marriages sometime before their fathers death. And for me, one of the real strengths of this book is how well it balances out the romance and the satirical humour of the situation with the real reality of the situation. While this book did make me laugh, I really have to sympathise with Mrs Bennett and what she's trying to do here. It's also really interesting when you consider that there is an element of Jane Austen's own life reflected in the situation the girls find themselves in. 
“We are all fools in love” 
I think what I loved about this is the pure drama of it all, but it's all so serious in it's frivolity. Even though we're talking about getting sick to hang out at your mans house longer, and buying ugly bonnets and running off with your new soldier boyfriend, the drama is compelling. I think that a real strength of this book is that it is so insightful. All the drama is perfectly positioned to make a Point, and all of it is deadly serious. Even though it's kind of funny Mrs Bennett is going to force her daughter to catch a cold just so she can (maybe) hang out with Bingley a bit longer, there is also a element of understanding and truth that rings in it - these girls really DO need to go to all lengths to get married. The satire is so well placed, and the story is so thoughtful. Elizabeth Bennett is also such a compelling and fun main character. She IS that bitch!! I loved how rebellious and independent she was, and her relationship with Jane was so beautiful. I really loved the focus on the girls strong bond and the prioritisation of the girls relationships with eachother over anything else. Elizabeth is also ICONIC. The bit when she verbally beat the shit out of Mr Darcy? I truly have decided to stan forever. Speaking of Mr Darcy - I have to say he's not in it as much I expected?? Everyone RAVES ABOUT HIM and I get it because, yeah there is something really appealing about him being The Hot Rich Bachelor Who is Really Into You But He's Too Awkward To Show It but he honestly doesn't feel like he appears that much? For me it felt like the Bennett sisters and Elizabeth's struggle to reconcile her situation and her happiness were much more interesting and pertinent themes and relationships than the romance. THAT SAID, I do still love the romance. God, the slow burn, angsty beauty of it all. Are we talking about That Scene in Permberly? I'm talking about it. When he comes across the fields and they catch awkward eyes and it's like okay they're in love PHEW love that. Also, when Elizabeth is at dinner half hoping half dreading he will turn up. SISTER why is that so relatable when this is a 200 year old book ??
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.”
There is something remarkable to me that in all the time since the publication of this book, so much of it stays relevant and loveable. I genuinely thought reading this it reads in some ways like a modern book. I loved that about reading this - even though it is obviously a classic it was so easy to read and get really invested in. It makes the reading experience so much better, since classics can be so hit and miss sometimes. Austen is funny and frank and insightful and thoughtful, and her characters are well developed and compelling. That Pride and Prejudice is so far from our everyday, and yet remains so relatable, and so beautiful, and that romance still stands is truly powerful in itself, and goes to show just what a GOOD book this is. I really really enjoyed this, and I plan on working through Austen's other works in the future. (Sense & Sensibility is most likely next). I will say this, literature world - I get the hype. ",en
735,84979,1903343036,it was amazing,"I am most certainly glad I gave this a second chance, I still cannot comprehend how I dnf this great work of literature. I love it so much, even more than Sense and Sensibility which I adore. I think I just found a new favourite classic.Jane Austen is a genius, that is the first thing you should know, the fact that this was published in 1813 seems so unreal, imagine those uptight 19th century people reading a leather bound copy of this.If you don't know the story of Pride and Prejudice prepare to be schooled, but beware of spoilers, I can't review this without mentioning some of my favourite spoilery parts, and if you have go ahead and read on.
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
That was the first paragraph, when you read that you'll be expecting a very cheesy love story but no, its nothing like that. There is politics, class division,family relationship, friendship and sisterly love.The Bennets are a middle class family with 5 daughters, the eldest Jane is 23 and Lydia the last is 16. The middle girls are Elizabeth,Mary and Catherine. At that time getting a rich husband is the highest thing a female can achieve and the Bennets sisters are all of a marriageable age.When Mr Bingley a bachelor moved to the manor next door, the whole of the female population wants him as a husband but he picked Jane, they fell in love had a falling in due to some interferances from his friend and family, but they sailed the storm and got married.Moving on to my favourite couple, Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, He is extremely rich and she not so much. He is prideful and she prejudicial due to his pride and some grieve news she heard about him, she loathe him with passion. Even when he first told her he loves her and proposed he did it in a prideful way, as if loving her was wrong, a quote of the scene.
""In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.""
Yep, that was a proposal and yes she refused then due to the things she heard about him, but he later explained what actually happened and she could not help but feel bad for judging him so.When next they met, he was the most attentive, not his usual uptight civilness. He even told her that he would love to introduce her to his younger sister.
""There is also one other person in the party,"" he continued after a pause, ""who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?""
When she got to know him better, she realized that he is not as prideful as she thought but socially awkward. The more she got to know him the better she liked him and she also fell in love with him.Months later after the first declaration of love and proposal he asked again, she has almost given up that he longer loves her, but he does.
After a short pause, her companion added, ""You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.""
She was glad he asked cause now she no longer dislike him but love him. He even changed for the better because of her.
""My object then,"" replied Darcy, ""was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.""
And below is more of my favourite quotes.
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?""""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.""""But I was embarrassed.""""And so was I.""""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.""""A man who had felt less, might.""""My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.

738,84979,1368053169,it was amazing,"I'd be frightened to count how many times I've read this wonderful book. Every time I find new and interesting views. This is one of those rare books that presents itself based on your own personal life experiences up to the time you read it. So, you see more aspects of each character, and relate differently to them. January 2016Yep, just read it again. Is there a Support Group? Maybe JAA? Jane Austen Anonymous?September 2017If this looks like a yearly phenomena to you, you would be right. I just love Jane Austen so much! I can see a pilgrimage in my future to her home.  It's the gift she had of making a scene heartstoppingly (yes I know that's not a word spellcheck. Get over yourself) romantic without the two characters even holding hands. I mean, do you realize Elizabeth and Darcy never touched each other? Unless you count the few times he took her gloved hand to help her into a carriage or while they were dancing. And yet they are known as one of the most passionate couples in literature. Wow!March 2018Another reread. Here’s something I noticed on this reread; Wickham romanced both young girls as revenge. Of course Georgiana as revenge against Darcy. That one is obvious. But I think he went after Lydia as revenge against Elizabeth. She called him out on his lies before his regiment left for Brighton. I wonder if Jane wrote that for that purpose? ?",en
739,84979,1985893961,liked it,"Pride and Prejudice is not that great which I was thinking. I read it without reading the blurb. Because I had too much confidence on the author. I had heard sooo much great things about Jane Austen. I am not saying they were false. No! Never! They were right. Everything was right. But I found this book rather boring for my taste. Don't know what is the principle reason. Plot was powerful. Characters were likeable. But all in vain for me.=> Jane Austen's writing is enchanting. Loved it. I liked that she used a great deal of dialogues. =>When I first started this book few weeks ago, I thought I would be getting a love-triangle-type story. It seemed like there would be a competition between Jane and Elizabeth that who would get Mr. Bingley. But no. I was wrong. And I was happy to be wrong. =>Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth's love interest was very good. Darcy was arrogant. And Elizabeth was sensible. I Loved both of them. But there were many hurdles and misunderstandings which were boring plus irritating for me. You know why? Because in love stories almost everything is predictable. You know no matter what, couple will be united in the ending. This thing is sure. I can't blame it for my boredom because that's what love stories show. But the hurdles in this book were irritating even though they were natural. Like Mr. Bingley's sister was attracted towards Mr. Darcy and Mr. Collins was attracted towards Elizabeth. And Mr. Darcy was attracted towards Elizabeth. AND Elizabeth was attracted towards Mr. Wickham. There were multiple love interests. I can't say I hated it because it was not a love-triangle type. But I was more interested in the love story of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth alone rather than them.=> Jane and Mr. Bingley's love story was the most boring one. They were just visiting, visiting and VISITING.... It was plain and the most boring of ALL!! Overall, more or less I liked this book. But not the way I was expecting. :(If you haven't read this book, then you should. You may enjoy it if you love 'love stories'. Don't be discouraged by my review.I am looking forward to read Emma by Jane Austen someday. Hope I will like it more than this book.",en

741,84979,466069035,it was amazing,"I suppose I first read this book more than 30 years ago. I am sure I was no more than an impressionable 16 or 17 year old. Oh, my, how I fell in love with Fitzwilliam Darcy. I have dipped into it now and again over the years. I devoured the BBC dramatization of the book. It was on Sunday nights. I set my VCR religiously. Watched it while recording it. Usually watched it again once or twice during the week while waiting for the following Sunday's episode. To say I was a bit obsessed is an understatement.Elizabeth Bennet. What a strong heroine. I loved her. She wasn't going to be put in her place by this aristocratic man. A host of secondary characters make for a very enjoyable read. Poor Mr Bennet. How he didn't throttle his wife is beyond me. Just checked the date of the BBC show and I realise that my first born was conceived during the airing of the show. LMAO. Better not tell Himself that.No, the pond scene from the TV series was not in the book. But when that was aired many moons ago ... the delight, the sexiness of it all.

742,84979,524661849,it was amazing,"I FINALLY know the love story of Mr. (Fitzwilliam) Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet!Initially...I have to admit...I thought the writing of Jane Austen somewhat tedious, but very soon fell into a groove and devoured the 361 pages in two days. I fell in love with the very well-developed (and crazy) characters, and enjoyed many laugh-out-loud moments. OMGOSH, Mrs. Bennet is an absolute ""hoot"", Mr. Collins a #1 SOB, and Mr. Wickham, (the worst of all), a money-grubbing first class lier. I cannot believe some of the insulting dialogue in this book expressed with such decorum! (I still have a smile on my face)When I finished reading Jane Eyre last week, I thought, this will be my favorite book of 2014, but now I am not so sure. What I do know is that Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen are two new favorite authors I plan to add to my list.

743,84979,648879589,it was amazing,"There is nothing new for me to say about this novel. I should just say I loved it. Period. But, whenever I hear people saying they don't get this novel, or that they don't find it amusing nor witty, I feel bad; they are missing so much. This is not just an ordinary love story about a poor girl who married the rich guy like a 2 p.m. soup opera. There is so much between the lines. First, the social context in which this novel was written. In Austen's time, marriage was a market. For a woman, money came from a father or a husband. So, you could really understand Mrs. Bennett's suffering. Speaking of her, she is one of the most colorful characters in the novel. Austen's wit and charm while describing all of them... just brilliant. What a funny, sarcastic and smart writer, trapped in the 18th century, when a female writer, any working woman, actually, wasn't appropriate, at all. There is a little bit of everything in this novel. Silly, negligent and kind of sweet parents, a biblical sister among the other nice and whimsical ones, an annoying Mr. Collins, elopements, people who not always are what they seem, a pair of wicked sisters, detailed descriptions about society, people, and landscapes in 18th century England, dances (although every savage can dance), and a true journey of self-discovery. In top of all that, she created one of the most beloved heroines in universal literature, Elizabeth Bennet, whose wit, charm and honesty make you fall in love with her from page one. She is funny but also has a somewhat sad vision of the world, a real one: There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.I love a strong female character whose mind is not full of pink and weddings just for the sake of being married. However, Elizabeth is not flawless; she tends to judge people before getting to know them. This novel shows her growth as a person, as well as Darcy's, the “proud” of the title. (You didn't see that one coming, huh?) Anyway, I said I didn't have anything new to said, so, yes, I was right. Pride and Prejudice may not be a truly original story, but the way Austen wrote it, her unique, ironic and honest writing style prevents you from taking a nap at page 100. At least, I didn't. I finished this book in two days. For me, that is fast; I tend to read and re-read every sentence, make a sandwich, bake a cake, and then there's work and that kind of unavoidable stuff of life, so, not a lot of free time for me, like the old days...Jun 23, 13* Also on my blog.",en

I struggled with getting used to the writing style and language at first but once I found my footing (which admittedly was about 1/4 of the way through) I began to really enjoy it. I loved the all drama and following the ins and outs of these characters lives. Lizzy's sassiness was everything, she felt so before her time. Jane was a sweetheart and Mr. Bennet is definitely a firm favourite. For me personally, I found the cast of characters to be largely unlikable but in a really great way.

746,84979,7995653,it was amazing,"I can't say anything fascinating about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said a thousand times. It is one of the best books I've ever read, if not the best. It is like a textbook on how to pace a story, which is a hard thing to do, for me at least. It is a perfect social comedy. The dialogue is both believable, natural-seeming, and yet ten million times more interesting, witty and articulate than anything real people say. The characters are so well-drawn, interesting, and deep that you get drawn into the story from the first page. Elizabeth Bennet is such a charming, funny, wonderful character - Jane Austen wrote, in a letter, about Elizabeth: ""I must confess that I think her as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to tolerate those who do not like her at least I do not know.."". The first sentence is a masterpiece of tongue-in-cheek social commentary: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in posession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" One thing I love about Jane Austen is that she never takes herself seriously, yet she clearly loves her characters, even when they are behaving idiotically. She seems to have had a great eye for the ridiculous in people and society, but not a bitter, hateful one. I've read many essays about the feminism of Jane Austen's writing; she clearly saw the desperation and despair of the social position of women: Unable to work, or even to inherit, they had to marry, and marry well, or live in poverty. And Jane Austen clearly saw women as intellectually equal to men. It must have been a frustrating, demeaning experience. Women probably were very lucky if they even liked the men they had to marry - Elizabeth came very close to being married off to the dorky, unbearably pompous Mr. Collilns - yet she ends up married very well, to Mr. Darcy, who she not only deeply loves, but appreciates very much for his fortune: She says, to her sister Jane, when Jane asks her how long Elizabeth has loved Mr. Darcy: ""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.

""Pride and Prejudice"" is possibly my favorite book of all time, my stranded-on-a-desert-island choice of reading. (If I were allowed two books in this adventure experiment, I would add ""Jane Eyre."" The third book is up for debate.) For this reread, I chose to listen to it on audio, performed marvelously by Rosamund Pike. You may remember that Rosamund played Jane in the 2005 movie version of P&P, and it was lovely to hear her read the whole novel. I know the beats of this story so well, but Austen's dialogue is so brilliant, her remarks on society so sharp, that each reading still feels fresh.

Pride and Prejudice
 is a timeless romance that everyone should read at least once in their lives.The daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were of age to marry. In pursuit of having all of them married starting with Jane, the eldest daughter, they attended a ball to which they were invited to meet Charles Bingley, a wealthy young man who recently rented Netherfield Park. Without a doubt, the man was mesmerized by Jane, dancing with her twice at the ball. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley’s closest friend, was not pleased with the course of their evening and their new acquaintances. At the said event, Mr. Darcy and Lizzy Bennet crossed paths. It was a disagreeable encounter that led Lizzy to assume that Mr. Darcy was purely arrogant.Elizabeth Bennet was a very outspoken young woman. As the second daughter to her parents, she has been depicted as most intelligent. She is well-read and sensible, but tends to judge other people, particularly Mr. Darcy, quickly. There were a lot of times that she would spoke too soon, not considering what her statement would cause another’s feelings. I honestly adore Lizzy. She made my feminist side very happy. I love that she knew how to fight for herself as a woman of that time. She never allowed anyone to dictate what she had to do. She’s very strong and I greatly adore her for it. She knew very well what she deserved and would never settle for anything less.Fitzwilliam Darcy, whom we have all commonly known as Mr. Darcy, was a prideful, rich man. He owns his decisions and stands for them, thinking that they were usually suitable and precise. He is one of those fictional male characters that, despite subtle of his intentions, surely makes readers swoon. Darcy was not the talkative type. He usually expressed himself with few words, not speaking unless necessary, and there were a lot of times mentioned wherein he was just staring at Lizzy. He was just simply looking at her and I think that was adorable.These two intelligent characters were very much the opposite of each other but, at the same time, very much alike at some points of their personality. Mr. Darcy was a very reserved man, while Lizzy would talk nonstop, her words causing ripples. Throughout the story, she has baffled almost everyone for her decisions, but in the end it was Mr. Darcy who surprised almost all of them for revealing his true self.Their romance was just grand and perfect to me. I think it will appeal to a lot of readers now and even those in the next generations to come. It is truthful to Jane Austen’s social class back her time, portraying a different kind of courtship than what we are used to today. If you’ve read the book, you will notice that all Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennet had were small talks and arguments, expecting the worst from each other, but still ending up deeply in love. How could one prove love, during that era, without the physical intimacy and the too-sweet and promising words? It could be perceived as false if a love developed that way today. There was so much for them to consider before entering the state of marriage: income, dowry, social status, reputation. It all seemed complicated, but in the end, all was worth it. I love how slow-burning it was. You could really see how Lizzy and Mr. Darcy got to know each other better, seeing the goodness that they both possess.I love how the supporting characters all affected Darcy and Lizzy’s relationship. Their decisions either pushed the couple together or pulled them apart. Most of them weren’t flat at all when it comes to development. They all had their struggles to deal with. I may have liked them, but I had a few problems with a few of them.Let me start with the couple who became the starting point of everything: Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley. These two were very unlike Darcy and Lizzy. Those two were decision-makers, while Bingley and Jane were almost always swayed by others. They were too soft and as spineless as one could be. I was so pissed off by them, most especially Mr. Bingley. He was so blind to believe Darcy’s (view spoiler)[opinion on the matter regarding Jane’s feelings for him. He’s supposed to know Jane more deeply for he was the one spending a lot of time with her and not Darcy. He’s so frustrating. If I were Jane, I would not have taken him back so easily. This is only my opinion, but I doubt Bingley greatly. How can a man fight for his relationship with a woman if he could be easily intimidated by the idea that her feelings for him may have not been equal with his for her? It seemed to me that their relationship’s foundation could be quickly shaken. (hide spoiler)]Next is little Lydia. I hate this girl! All she did when she (view spoiler)[got married to Mr. Wickham (hide spoiler)] was boast about it as if she’d just taken over the world and became its idol. She kept on acting like she was the most fortunate among all the young women in existence. Surely, anyone who ever started a conversation with a girl like her had imagined different ways of making her shut up. I think she was trying to grow up as fast as she can, just to get ahead of everyone else.If there was one of them that I wished I read more of, it was Ms. Darcy. She seemed so adorable to me and I wanted to find out how she could get closer to Lizzy. She seemed like Darcy’s sunshine before Ms. Bennet and it would be really wonderful if I got to know more about her relationship with her brother.My biggest problems with this book are all the gossips and balls that transpired. I know that they were a big part of the social status depicted, but they were just not my cup of tea. There were quite a number of times that I had to put down the book and yawn. Literally. I felt very sleepy and bored. Despite this, I admit that most of the story was very entertaining and interesting. It was a unique experience to me of a time I knew very little of.The ending lacked celebration, in my opinion. It was a powerful ending, but I think it was the part of the story that most certainly needed a gathering or a ball. It needed a lot of rejoicing after all the trouble that they all have been through. The good thing about it is that every important person in the novel got what they were longing for and they were all at peace with one another. All that’s left to do was love.This was a beautiful read and one of the best classics I’ve read so far. I recommend it to anyone who’s in the mood for some fun and light romance.",en
756,84979,1262516984,it was amazing,"I first read this book when I was 14, my French lit teacher highly recommend it to me, knowing how much I love Classic lit.It only took me a few days to finish it, and immediately become one of my all time favourite books. There is just something about it that speaks to me. You know, when you read a book and think, “That's it.”? That's me with Pride & Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is one of those books you know everybody has already read at least once in their life or heard about it, it’s this one classic that has been adapted into so many series and movies you just cannot ignore its existence.I find the title and the meaning behind it extremely interesting, because everybody in this book is full of pride and prejudiced against something. Deep down, they all carry some aspect of ‘pride and prejudice’ and that’s why I think this title is clever, it just doesn’t work with the main characters but also the sides characters . . . and ultimately with every human being — well, maybe not Jane and Bingley, it’s quite hard to find something wrong with these two.Elizabeth Bennet is probably one of the most strong-minded characters I've ever read about. For her, it's both a quality and a default. Once she makes up her mind, it's nearly impossible to make her change it, even when she's wrong. It won't surprise you that her worst default is her pride. If you hurt her pride, there is a 95% chance she won't ever forgive you.I like her because she proves to be extremely kind and loving towards her friends and family; because she values her freedom of choice and isn't afraid to say no. I won't say she's a feminist, because she still feels ‘grateful’ towards Darcy when she finds out he still loves her despite the way she spoke to him when she declined his hand. BUT for her time, it was still considered as revolutionary.I must say I'm not a big fan of her making fun of other people, it's not something I appreciate about her. I think you should be able to spend your time and be happy without ridiculing other people.Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of my absolute favourite characters ever! I simply don't understand how someone can not love him. It's beyond my comprehension.I personally think Darcy is both autistic and demisexual. These are my headcanons. It just makes SO much sense! Darcy doesn't like to make eye contact, nor speaking with strangers, things he doesn't understand, having to face something he's not acclimated to; he sees the world and understands things differently. At first, he doesn't like Elizabeth or isn't even remotely interested in her, no. He falls for her after taking the time to know her better, doesn't fall for the way she looks - though he really likes her eyes - but for her mind, the way she speaks and thinks.I understand why Darcy acted the way he did with Jane and Bingley . . . Don't tell me you wouldn't do anything to protect your best friend from having his heart broken if you thought the lady he's in love with doesn't love him back? I won't believe you. I would be extremely happy and honoured to count him as a friend.This book also deals with the way society expects women to behave a certain way if they want to survive in this world, and how men are privileged. It's explicitly said how Jane, Elizabeth and their sisters can't expect to marry someone with money if they're not well-educated though the men they will possibly marry don't have to half as accomplished. Women were expected to be pretty things and to shut their mouth. That's probably why I like Elizabeth so much : she fights again this. If marrying someone means she has to forget who she is, then she simply won't marry anyone.In the end, I think it’s a book you can enjoy even if you’re not all about classic British literature, or a huge fan of a love story, because this book is so much more than that. It’s so much more than a woman and a man falling in love, it’s a critic of society, and it’s still relevant nowadays.",en
757,84979,1228273477,it was ok,"“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”El extenso éxito y fama que ha tenido Jane Austen a lo largo de los años ha sido sin lugar a dudas algo que no ha pasado desapercibido. Sus libros se siguen y seguirán leyendo de forma continua y muchos de ellos pueden llevar la etiqueta de clásico universal. Con un estilo ligero y cómico, Jane Austen logró ser una mujer que fue capaz de romper con los esquemas de la mujer sumisa, acompañado también del constante cuestionamiento sobre el conservadurismo extremo del siglo XIX, el cual, debió a más de uno, causar un dolor de cabeza. Pride and Prejudice, su novela más vendida y reconocida, fue la primera experiencia que tuve con la autora británica. Y me gustó. Sí, estuvo bien, de hecho, llegué a tener unos pequeños gritos (sin saltos de por medio) de emoción en algunas partes, de los cuales puedo decir que me sentí como un(a) adolescente con mariposas en el estómago. Sin embargo, el libro no me cambió la vida, ni tuvo una fuerte influencia en mí. En cambio, entiendo perfectamente a la gente que tiene la historia de Elizabeth Bennet y Fitzwilliam Darcy en lo más profundo del corazón. Y es que cuando lo leía (con el perdón de los Austerianos) no dejaba de pensar Y es que es una comedia romántica. Porque para mi, fue y es una comedia romántica. Una muy bien lograda, con personajes (quizás muchos) realmente interesantes, con una trama pulida y trabajada y con una historia disfuncional muy cómica que te hace pasar un buen rato. Pero ya está. “Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” Y no es que yo tenga algo contra las comedias románticas, pero las buenas experiencias que había causado esta historia a millones de personas, me había creado una expectativa enorme. Eso causó que me entregara de lleno al libro incluso antes de abrirlo y que la experiencia haya sido más que nada, tibia. Sin embargo, sigo creyendo que si no hubiera tenido la vara tan alta con la historia de Austen, el resultado y quizás la calificación sería otra. En resumidas cuentas, esta historia trajo consigo momentos de reflexión, emoción y risas. Es por eso que no me doy por vencido, y sé, que en algún momento de mi vida, abriré este libro de nuevo, y me adentrare en esta divertida, ágil, singular y compleja historia de Austen. ",es
758,84979,758091237,it was amazing,"I couldn't put this book down! Favorite Quotes: ""Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her."" And ""Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure.""UPDATE: RE-READ 12/09/2014Elizabeth Bennett is so funny! So is her father, and that is why they get along so well. I don't find Elizabeth to be particularly nerdy or bookish. In fact, her sister Mary is this way and made fun of constantly for it. It's strange to me that sometimes Lizzie is portrayed as more 'nerdy' in some re-writes and film adaptations, when really she is kind of an optimistic, cheerful spitfire.I also love to see such a close sisterly relationship such as exists between Jane and Elizabeth. They really love and support each other. They celebrate each other's joy, and weep at each other's sorrows. It's very touching. I always love seeing good sibling relationships, I must admit the idea of having four sisters (in addition to myself) is a lovely and cozy one to me. I love big families!Some people find Pride and Prejudice a difficult book to read. If you find that you cannot 'get into it' or are having a hard time understanding it, I highly recommend watching a film version of it, and THEN attempting to read the book. It will make a lot more sense if you are already familiar with the characters and general plot.The book is fun! Don't think of it as stuffy and old, or boring. It really is like a romantic comedy in a lot of ways. Austen had a good sense of humor.Hands down the best film version is the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. In second place, Joe Wright's version with Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen. BBC 1980 Version with Elizabeth Garvie.Another, more 'fun,' and modern version is Gurinder Chadha's delightful Bride and Prejudice starring the absolutely gorgeous Aishwarya Rai (OMG she is so beautiful), and Martin Henderson.I don't really like the 1940 Robert Z. Leonard version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. But I know a lot of older people in my family adored it. People who actually saw it on the big screen. :) LOL Also, the woman cast as Charlotte Lucas is very beautiful. She's not supposed to be!I still prefer Sense and Sensibility to Pride and Predjudice.And another thing! Darcy looks down on Eliza so much because of her family, but his aunt is certainly someone to be ashamed of, is she not? Humph!",en
759,84979,1115781364,really liked it,"This is a great love story with some very silly characters in it! From the beginning, I almost couldn't believe Kitty's and Lydia's behaviour, and the silly mother was adorable but also abominable. Jane seemed too shy for my taste, and the only two characters from the Bennet family that really grew on me were Elizabeth and her father. However, if it wasn't for those silly caricatures I don't think this story would have worked. They helped enhance the story, and I ended up appreciating reading about them because they made me smile and sigh. This was my first time actually reading this story (even though I have watched the movie multiple times) and this book comes with some of my favourite lines! I wanted to underline then but decided not to because I was reading the beautiful Penguin Clothbound edition, but I specifically remember one scene containing Elizabeth, her father and her mother discussion a certain Mr. Collins (no spoilers!). I loved it and scenes like those were what made me root for Elizabeth (and her father!). One of the things that I love the most about this story, though, is the struggle and opposition between the two main characters. It created a very interesting tension and it made me root for both of them - even though Mr. Darcy is quite despicable in the beginning! I'm happy I finally managed to actually read the book, and I'm happy I ended up liking it as much as I did :-)",en

O carinho e a amizade entre Lizzie e Jane também é uma das minhas coisas favoritas!E, claro, ler um livro que foi publicado em 1813 e traz uma protagonista feminina tão forte e decidida, que não abaixa a cabeça pra ninguém, só me deixou com mais vontade de conhecer os outros livros da Jane Austen.

764,84979,1822056473,it was amazing,"Orgulho e preconceito é o filho mais querido dos seis livros escritos por Jane Austen. Apesar de ter sido criticado por Mark Twain , Charlotte Bronte entre outros, é um livro encantador , mostrando os costumes de uma época que a Inglaterra estava em transição para a era Vitoriana. A maior preocupação de uma mãe era casar sua filha com um bom partido. Bailes e festas eram frequentes ,era o principal meio de as moças conhecerem os rapazes e as moças mais novas serem apresentadas à sociedade. Este livro foca a família Bennet com cinco filhas e nenhum filho, logo quando o sr Bennet morresse a propriedade ficaria com um primo pois a família não tinha um filho para ser o herdeiro. A chegada de dois jovens , o rico Charles Bingley e seu soberbo amigo Darcy vão dar o enredo principal do livro, mas muitas coisas acontecem ao mesmo tempo nesse livro . Mas como será o relacionamento dos jovens recém chegados de classe alta com a atrapalhada família Bennet de classe média?. Cada membro da família bennet tem sua característica marcante; o sr Bennet sempre irônico e calmo, a sra Bennet sempre escandalosa e dramática . Agora passemos para as filhas: as 2 filhas mais novas desmioladas só pensam em oficiais, Mary sempre na dela lendo, Jane sempre dócil, e Elizabeth , uma das personagens mais marcantes da literatura, forte, poderosa e feminista. Agora vocês imaginem esse emaranhado de personagens se cruzando e se juntando a outros que não mencionei aqui.!!""Orgulho e Preconceito” não é, como em inúmeros romances que existem, uma história de amor à primeira vista , na maioria deles os relacionamentos vão se desenrolando aos poucos , há primeiro o interesse depois a conquista.

765,84979,2670097418,really liked it,"Empiezo el año con una relectura, ""Orgullo y prejuicio"" una novela de Jane Austen narrada de una forma simple pero, en algunos párrafos, poética. Cuenta la historia de las cinco hijas de los Bennet en la época de la Regencia, aunque Austen no se para a dar datos históricos del momento, porque se centra en otros temas sociales, como son la falta de derechos y decisiones de las mujeres, el sometimiento de éstas a un matrimonio, a buscar un buen marido que las mantenga sin posibilidad de que ninguna de ellas trabaje para que pueda mantenerse por sí misma y no dependan de ningún hombre, o la ley de Mayorazgo que a estas hijas les impide heredar la casa paterna, por lo que necesitan un marido, para que, en caso de fallecer el padre, tengan donde vivir. El heredero del Sr. Bennet es el Sr. Collins un personaje un arrogante y pretencioso. A la villa llega el Sr. Bingley la salvación para la familia Bennet si una de las hijas consigue casarse con él, objetivo principal de la Sra. Bennet sin importarle si sus hijas llegarán o no a ser felices.El orgullo que muestra Elizabeth le impide ver más allá y cree conocer a todo el mundo, y los prejuicios del Sr. Darcy hacia una persona de clase inferior le impiden mostrar sus sentimientos.Trata temas como la libertad, rebeldía, la presión social, las costumbres y tradiciones sociales.Novela típicamente inglesa, que en apariencia tiene una historia tranquila de ritmo lento y pausado pero con enredos de sentimientos, contados desde la ironía, humor y batallas verbales como la escena que tiene lugar entre Elizabeth Bennet y Lady Catherine de Bourgh y una gran belleza de descripciones.La mayoría de la obra es un constante diálogo con lo cual no aburre al lector, a pesar de que a veces no pasa nada, con curiosas charlas sociales que parecen un manual de instrucciones de comportamiento de la alta sociedad inglesa.Volveré a leerla y me volverá a encantar.",es
766,84979,902372362,it was ok,"I'm disclaiming this review with the statement that I 100% intend on rereading this and giving it a higher rating. But boy, was it an ~experience~ diving into this for the first time. I've been avoiding Pride & Prejudice spoilers for 20 years. I scroll past screenshots, I haven't read/watched any retellings, all because I wanted to preserve my Pride & Prejudice virginity and read the book without having any prior knowledge. And wow was that the wrong decision.This is one of the ONLY books that I would argue you need to see the movie first. You need to have some prior knowledge of this book--be it the Lizzy Bennett Diaries or the 2005 movie or even reading it for a class--because if not, everything is going to read like garbage. I couldn't bring myself to care about ANYTHING in this book.I actually cried 100 pages into this book because I hated it and I felt stupid that I didn't understand why everyone liked it when I was so bored and confused and miserable. I wanted to DNF it at that point but decided to finish it just out of pure spite that I wanted to know what would happen. AND IT WAS SO LACK LUSTER. Mr. Darcy is NOT the man that everyone claims he is. Everything in this book was waaay overhyped for me, and it all read so melodramatic or uninteresting. The characters were so shallow and boring, and I couldn't even bring myself to be amused at the hyperbolic vapidity of all the other characters obsessed with class and money because it just set up such a ~~UR NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS~~ narrative when it came to Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.I'm severely disappointed because after reading Persuasion for class I was sure I would also enjoy this, but I ended up just audiobooking it at two times speed, wishing it were over the entire time.(But again, I fully intend to watch the movie and then revisit this and make fun of this review as I profess my newfound love for Mr. Darcy.

He's back on the swoon-worthy heroes list where he belongs.^^ He's like ""Gee thanks, Anne, why on earth was I ever taken down the list in the first place?""...and for those of you who might be wondering what is going on and what I mean by admitting defeat, here's a faithful narrative of all my dealings with Mr. Darcy (oh my gosh, I can't believe I just wrote that!):I was initiated to Pride and Prejudice when I was about 13, and watched the 2005 movie adaptation with my cousins. I understood nothing, and didn't think much of it, besides a general feeling of really liking the time period. Then over the years I saw it again, and then I saw the 1995 adaptation, which I will just confess right now to finding boring as hell the first time I tried to watch it, and I couldn't even finish it. It was so long. And nothing happened. But as I grew older, and seriously demonstrated a strong interest in all things historical, it sort of just went accordingly that I must love P&P. I watched the 1995 adaptation again. And I loved it. Wondered what the devil had possessed me to even think of calling it ""boring"", and from then on, I became an official Austen fan and watched any other movie JA-related that I could find. It wasn't until my senior year though, when I finally read the book for an independent study, that I fully realized how wonderful Pride and Prejudice was. More in love with the story than the characters, I delighted in the polished manners, the beautiful prose, the simplicity of the characters' lives, and the universal and timeless themes Austen dealt with. Yes, I liked Mr. Darcy. Yes, I remember watching the movie at some point and thinking I needed to find him. Yes, he made me swoon. But a couple of years ago, I entered the wonderful and addictive world of JAFF (Jane Austen Fan-Fiction), and fell so much in love with some of the twists and turns authors gave to the story and characters, that I began to doubt whether Pride and Prejudice had really been as amazing as I'd thought. I mean, Darcy became so really, REALLY swoon-worthy by turns, that I thought I must have mistaken the matter about the real Darcy and fancied him swoonier than he really was. In my best efforts not to confuse JAFF, movies, and the actual Austen novel, I ended up confusing myself and forgetting what it was really all about, and how truly wonderful Darcy is for real. And come to think of it, I've always been conflicted about some aspect or other of Pride and Prejudice. It's like, so classic, so universal, so expected to be loved by classic readers and/or Regency romance readers, that I often find myself questioning weather I REALLY love it, or if I'm just saying it because it goes accordingly that I should love it. I mean, come on, even people who don't read know what Pride and Prejudice is!""Oh, you like to read? What sort of books do you like?""""Um, classics, Regency roman-""""Ooohh!! Like Pride and Prejudice! Okay, I get it!""You guys know what I mean. It's expected to like this book. It gets the point across. Now, having gone thus far into admitting all this, let's go still a little deeper and make a perfectly clean breast of it. I may have re-discovered Pride and Prejudice's merits and awesomeness, and fallen for Mr. Darcy all over again, but I still need to make a few confessions. 1- Let's make things perfectly clear regarding Darcy. First, I am totally guilty as charged. Darcy is such a complicated enigma of a man as seen through Elizabeth's eyes that I do not understand him, but would you really go out looking for a man whose character you don't understand? I think that in our own way, we all want a Darcy. We all want a man who will love us unconditionally for who we are, and who will perfectly understand us and be witty with us. But I do not want the Darcy. Yes, I love the guy. No, I'm not intrigued by his mysterious and reserved character, his brooding good looks, his immense wealth, his proud façade or his omg-Bingley-why-did-you-bring-me-to-this-party-it-sucks airs. Nope, nope, nope. Okay, sure, it gives him a little charm and makes him stand out, but the real hot thing about Darcy is his devotion to Elizabeth. It's the way he falls completely and undeniably in love with her, and how he remains so throughout the whole story even though Miss Lizzy is acting all bitchy that really gets me and makes me love him. His opinion once lost might be lost forever, but his heart once given is also given forever. 2- Straight up, I love Jane so much more than Lizzy. Lizzy is lively. Lizzy it witty. Lizzy is intelligent. Lizzy is the best heroine evaaaahhhh!She's also smug, judgemental, prejudiced and unforgiving. Her opinion once lost was nearly lost forever! Look, I don't hate Lizzy, but seriously she's my least favourite of all the Austen heroines (wait and see my opinion change tomorrow and proclaim Liz was always my fave. I'm hopeless :P). Elinor is so sensible. Anne is so patient. Fanny has such good principles. Catherine is so sweet. Emma...ok, I admit I like Lizzy better than Emma, but still, you get my point. Lizzy hates Mr. Darcy not because he's proud, cold, grumpy, or awkward. She hates him because he had the balls to call her ""tolerable"" within earshot. I know I'd be piqued if it happened to me too, but come on, she doesn't even give him a chance! He's the most disagreeable man in the world because he didn't want to dance and called her tolerable. Oh, woe. What a despicable being.Let's face it, she's so dead set against the man that she believes all Mr. Wickham blabs about him, ON FIRST ACQUAINTANCE. Like, ""Oh thank you so much for strengthening my belief that Mr. Darcy is the worst of men! I don't know you, but you spoke against Darcy, so you must be right and I really like you!!"". AND THEN YOU TELL ME LIZZY IS INTELLIGENT AND HAS GOOD JUDGEMENT??!!!And her wit? I don't give a fig for it! She says so herself that her behaviour bordered on the uncivil half the time. Jane is so much better. She's nice and sweet and devoted, doesn't talk ill of anyone, always thinks positively and doesn't let herself be carried away by her feelings for Bingley. I just love that girl.3- I may have admitted that Darcy was dreamy hero, but Bingley, although not precisely the swoony type, is my favourite of the two. Who could dislike him?! Sure, he's not everyone's dream, but come on, everyone would want him as a friend! And he would make a wonderful husband. He's just not the typical hero one looks for when reading a romance novel. Still, I LOVE HIM!! Truly, I'm glad to be an Austen reader. Now that I have read all six of her novels, I can honestly say that I love them all equally, and they all take turns being my top favourite. Being an Austen addict made me discover a wonderful genre of literature, enabled me to meet wonderful people who love her as much (and more!) as I do, makes me spend delicious hours watching all the adaptations, and just generally makes me so happy that I regret nothing. Yes, by reading so much historical romance, my own standards are pretty darn high, but I don't think I should lower them. Good luck to me, but there you have it! Whew. That was a lot of rambling and a lot of confessions for one review! I think I needed to write it all down to understand my thoughts. 'Til this moment, I never knew myself (here I go again...). If you have read this far, you are really awesome, and we totally deserve to celebrate with some eye-candy!!And for a hilarious (and true) take on Darcy, read this.Buddy read with Marquise in November 2015.

774,84979,484815479,really liked it,"Edit: 01/30/15I watched the movie (the Knightley version) and can I just tell you guys that I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS WHOLE STORY A BIT MORE. okay. A LOT. I want all my friends to read this because I CANNOT FANGIRL WITH ANYONE!!! (sadly, it's not a required reading in our school like in some other places.)I was like oh no no no so not a good time (BUT ALL THE FEELS)hi hi hi---At first, this was really so hard to get into because of some terms that I've encountered only for the first time. English wasn't my first language but I thought I was fluent with it enough until this book forced me to go get my dictionary.Moving on, I was quite peeved by the long sentences. It felt like the articles in our law subject which I cannot read without stopping at the middle to catch my breath. I have to read them again to have a better comprehension of what happened.As for the characters, I have something to say for each of them which I will insert a spoiler tag as to not spoil those who haven't read the book.(view spoiler)[Elizabeth Bennet - Sarcastic. Truthful. She doesn't worry about speaking what's on her mind if she knew it was right. I like her. Both she and Mr. Darcy suffered pride and prejudice. I kind of liked when she started getting feelings for Darcy. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy - Holy craaaaap. Okay okay. I understood now why he was always mentioned in a lot of books! I was quite sad however when he was betrayed, he started seeing all people to have motives of any kind. But that is perfectly understandable. Jane Bennet - Wow. Handsome and so kind. I kind of admired how she operate because seeing evil being done doesn't mean you have to do it too, right? Mr. Bingley - Uhm. I don't know. But I don't really get why he was affected by what his friend thinks. I get that they really trust each other but.. to leave Jane just like that? Or did Jane didn't really felt the same way for Bingley at first? Mrs. Bennet - How many times was I mortified by what she was doing like Elizabeth? I cannot count. But I believe she just wants what's best for her daughters, like any mother, even thoug she didn't do things in the best approach possible.Lydia Bennet - I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE GOT MARRIED FIRST. Miss Bingley - HAHAHAHA. Eat that! (hide spoiler)]Anyway, that is all.

Oh My God. Did that sentence ever brought out feels. And there was no problem having an 'instalove' incident because falling in love is a process, I believe, and Jane Austen showed the right way to do it.I won't deny that I got bored at some parts but I think that's understandable since I'm not a classic fan, really. This book made me think that I'm missing out on something great though. Isn't that right classic fans?This post wasn't at all necessary after all the reviews that was written for this book. But I just felt compelled to write my feelings about it. I wasn't assigned to read it for my class or something but I did not regret reading this one.I think...I like to read another book by Jane Austen. Yes, I would like that very much.Edit: This book deserves another star because MR. Darcy. <3",en
775,84979,359230004,it was amazing,"Favourite classic book that I've read this year!Initial thoughts:1. Surprisingly relatable and relevant. The family dynamic between all the members is all over the place (like it should be). There's love, annoyance, exasperation, loyalty, and concern. I was thoroughly entertained.2. I really enjoyed the plot direction. I was surprised by the twists, and actions of the characters.3. The writing is excellent. Yes, there are aspects of the book I had to re-read to understand what was going on, but for the most part I was able to pick it up it well.4. Funny? Oh yeah. I wasn't expecting to laugh and be amused by the characters. Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet, and Mrs. Bennet are particularly hilarious.5. Loved the romance. Mr. Darcy's gestures towards Elizabeth was so insanely sweet, and selfless. It's subtle, and not in-your-face-gross.I love this book. Check out my book and movie review here!",en
776,84979,300688255,it was amazing,It's been so long since I've read this and it's just as lovely as I remembered. I adore the banter between Elizabeth and Darcy and the last few chapters are just perfection.,en
777,84979,1228226994,it was ok,"Okay. Wow. That was torturous. But Evelyn! There are so many things to appreciate in here! Don't be a hater! Oh, I appeciate it all right. I appreciate the talks about social classes and... the balls. Let's not forget all that dancing. It took up like the entire effing beginning of the book.  You're being sarcastic, aren't you? Only partly. Because if there are any saving graces about  Pride and Prejudice, it would be the way Austen gives me a walk-through through the early 19th century times. I get to see how people interact socially with one another, and judge their views about the old society, etcetra... But? But it's all BORE BORE BORE. Nothing interesting happens but drama, drama, drama. That's really what this book is about. It's a romantic drama. Duh. Well, I'll be damned but that doesn't make it any more interesting. In my personal opinion, half the things that happened here are unimportant and irrelevant, and Austen's long winded, insipid writing style didn't do much to help. *snores* Is that it? Nope. If there's one thing that I despise. It's the whole talk about marrying-for-the-money, and the insta-freaking-love-with-no-slow-burn-of-chemistry. Now you're being damn ignorant- Shut up. I know it's the old fashioned society when women used to marry for the man's wealth and stability. Yada yada yada. It still doesn't stop me from going cross-eyed with annoyance. And god, I very nearly want to bash everyone's heads in when they won't stop talking trash about other people's business. Please stick your nose where it belongs. Thank you.Moving on. But what about Darcy and Elizabeth? Bingley and Jane? They're in looooove. Even if they are, I feel no slow burn of romance between those 2 couples. Darcy's attraction toward Elizabeth felt too abrupt (though I appreciate how Elizabeth took time to form affection for him) and I just don't see what connects Jane and Bingley together??? What makes their relationship so special???? I can't answer that. I'm only your subconscious and I have next to no idea like yourself I'll leave Jane Austen's fans to that then. If anyone asks, I think the movie is a much better alternative. I think I'll stick to that.***In short, this was a chore to read. The talks and the balls. Lord help me from all that. I'm well off reading all about monsters and fantastical stuffs.  Pride and Prejudice is simply not my cuppa.",en

Life is short, and my time for reviews even shorter. I'm sorry to those who read every one of my reviews, because I am saying this almost every time now. But it also seems important to repeat this fact for those who aren't familiar with my reviews...or for those who might have forgotten how long winded and detailed my older reviews were. I take pride and find great enjoyment in writing all of my reviews-but as it turns out, if I want to write reviews at this time of my life, they need to be short and sweet (I'm even writing this review on my phone in the notes section, which is causing even more problems to arise). So this brings me back to my original point-this review won't be long, detailed, or gushy. It will be quick, to the point, and only focus on the nitty gritty. As it turns out, that will be very easy. This was far from a favorite, so it won't pain me to shorten my thoughts and get to the point...but I don't want my words mistaken: while this wasn't a favorite, I far from hated it. 
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.

Pride and Prejudice is a book I've never wanted to read...but when Mr. Darcy is mentioned in literally EVERY little thing, one tends to take notice (hark, am I reading another book because of a boy again?? Sigh, I really am too easy). I've never been one to love historicals and I can't say I like deciphering every little thing as I read, but I finally just decided to give it a go-a fact my dear friend noticed and caused her to buy the book for me as a gifty nudge...I truly love Jennifer for her devotion to a beloved favorite, and admire her stubbornness in my needing to read it-who says two chicks don't become more and more alike (cough pushy) the longer they chat. Needless to say I was right in my assumption-No, the classics aren't for me. They are a bit slower and, frankly, I felt dumb when I read this. The writing is very good...but my comprehension level was virtually nonexistent. Now, to be fair, I got the hang of it, but not until I truly got interested-coincidence? I think not. At 50%, this book really took a turn for me. Whether it was the adorably haughty, yet earnest, Darcy (it totally was) or the idea that things were taking a turn for the better (again, it was Darcy), I finally gave a shit. I started smiling more and I got butterflies. I became invested and longed for the story to have always been that way. 

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantages of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.
Finally there was something to root for and a reason to be reading this. Darcy was clearly in love with Lizzy and she finally started to see the good in him...I'm all for animosity between a couple, but it pained me to wait in this one. I'm sorry, but 40% on who should court whom and how everyone is related and the idea that marriage was the basis of the novel...well, it became a bit tedious (in my hardly reputable opinion). I'm all for a relationship fueled book, but for the love of God let it be leading somewhere for our main couple (and not ONLY at 50%!!!). And I know I know it's about family and...okay, whatever, the beginning is above me. But my point remains-GET TO THE GOOD SHIT! For all of us, Janey. In short, I could live my whole life and never read that first 50% again, and be fine. But that would mean I'd have to give up the last 50% and that I'm not so okay with. There's something to be said for a simple story and a cute, but arrogant, male lead. And...After saying all this...I've decided I will read this again. I don't know when, and I don't know if the result will be the same, but I sure am hoping for a total win and that full effect. <3For more of my reviews, please visit:

Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy is twenty-eight years old and unmarried, Mr Darcy is also the wealthy owner of the famous family estate of Pemberley in Derbyshire, and is rumored to be worth at least ten thousand pounds a year. He makes a poor impression on strangersMr Bennet is the patriarch of the Bennet family, a gentleman of modest income with five unmarried daughters. Mr Bennet has a sarcastic, cynical sense of humor. He loves his daughters (Elizabeth in particular).Mrs Bennet is the wife of Mr Bennet and mother of Elizabeth and her sisters. Her public manners and social climbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth. Her favorite daughter is the youngest, Lydia. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters to a wealthy man of good fortunes.Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth about Darcy, on the title page of the first illustrated edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.Jane Bennet is the eldest Bennet sister (1 of 5). Twenty-two years old and she is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighborhood. Her character is contrasted with Elizabeth's as sweeter, shyer, and equally sensible, but not as clever; her most notable trait is a desire to see only the good in others. She grows to be in love with Mr. Bingley, a rich man who recently moved to Hertfordshire. Mary Bennet is the only plain Bennet sister (3 of 5), and rather than join in some of the family activities, she reads mostly. She works hard for knowledge and accomplishment, but she has neither genius nor taste. Catherine, or Kitty, Bennet is the fourth daughter at 17 years old. Although older than her, she is the shadow of Lydia. Lydia Bennet is the youngest Bennet sister (5 of 5), she's 15. Her main activity in life is socializing, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. She is the first Bennet sister to marry.Charles Bingley is a handsome, good-natured, and wealthy young gentleman of 23, who rents Netherfield Park near Longbourn. He is contrasted with his friend Mr Darcy as being more kind and more charming and having more generally pleasing manners, although not quite so clever.Caroline Bingley is the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley; she has a dowry of twenty thousand pounds. Miss Bingley has romantic intentions for Mr Darcy, and she is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth and is disdainful and rude to her. George Wickham has been acquainted with Mr Darcy since childhood, having been under the guardianship of Mr Darcy's father. He spreads tales about the wrongs Mr Darcy has done him, adding to the local society's prejudice, but eventually he is found to have been the wrongdoer himself. He runs off with Lydia and marries her.William Collins, aged 25, is Mr Bennet's clergyman cousin and heir to his estate. He is ""not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society."" Mr Collins is obsequious, pompous, and lacking in common sense. Elizabeth's rejection of Mr Collins's marriage proposal is welcomed by her father, regardless of the financial benefit to the family of such a match. Mr Collins then marries Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte Lucas.Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who possesses wealth and social standing, is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending, although her manner is seen by some as entirely proper and even admirable. Lady Catherine's nephew, Mr Darcy, is offended by her lack of manners, especially towards Elizabeth, and he later courts her disapproval by marrying Elizabeth in spite of her numerous objections.Aunt and Uncle Gardiner: Edward Gardiner is Mrs Bennet's brother and a successful businessman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is close to her nieces Elizabeth and Jane. Jane stays with the Gardiners in London for a period, and Elizabeth travels with them to Derbyshire, where she again meets Mr Darcy. They are both actively involved in helping Mr Darcy arrange the marriage between Lydia and Mr Wickham.Georgiana Darcy is Mr Darcy's quiet, amiable, and shy younger sister, aged 16 when the story begins. Charlotte Lucas is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 years old, fears becoming a burden to her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr Collins, whom she does not love, to gain financial security.",en

Read in 2013, reviewed on 2/26/16:
One of the best books I've read. Ever.
“Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
Hat's off to you Jane Austen, Hat's off. With Pride and Prejudice, you managed to make me realize how much feelings we can have in one single second. In this book, we follow the Bennets, and more particularly Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bennet, the second of five daughters. This is a main character I can totally connect with. She is independent and stubborn and passionate. She loves books and she is down-to-earth, not fooling around like her three younger sisters: Kitty, Mary and Lydia . Those girls are very immature and living in the shadow of the youngest of them three, the frivolous Lydia Bennet. Jane Bennet, the eldest sister is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighborhood; she is shyer and sweeter than Lizzy, even though the two of them are very close. We can consider that the Bennets, as well as their friends are part of the middle class. Moreover, because he only fathered girls, when Mr. Bennet dies, his money, estate and commodities will be bequeath to his cousin, Mr. William Collins, and Mrs. Bennet (whose main ambition in life is to marry her daughter to wealthy men) and the Bennets sisters will have nowhere to live.The story begins when the very rich Mr. Charles Bingley moves to Hertfordshire, with his sister, Caroline and his close friend of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Mr. Bingley is lovely but Mr. Darcy makes a less favorable impression by being condescending and proud. When Mr. Bingley and Jane grow fond of each other and he doesn’t hide his lack of approbation for their mutual caring. Mr. Darcy expresses his disdain for the Bennets and criticizes their behavior as well as their physical appearance (saying that Lizzy is plain, sentence that she overhears, claiming then to her best friend Charlotte that she despites him).
“I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
I was mesmerized by the gradual tension and how relationships were built during this book. Jane Austen really did a great job. This book is not cliché nor cheesy. It properly shows the inequalities and questioning for that period. I felt emotions I didn’t know existed; the chemistry between our characters was sometimes unbearable. I loved the Pride of both Lizzy and Darcy, it made them sassy and impertinent sometimes, which lead to mutual Prejudice. Even if they were in the early 19th century, and that at that time people were more private with their feelings and expressed less in public, I truly lived their passion and felt butterflies in my belly at their outburst of feelings.I want to add a special part for two adaptations of this book that I adored with all my heart, as much as I loved this book. The first one is the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen (that you can seen in the many gif that illustrate this review), this movie warmed up my heart and soul, the actors are amazing and so true to the original character. The second one is The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which is a web series adapted from the book, only in the 21st century, and where the story is conveyed in the form of vlogs. This adaptation is less known that the previous one, but it worth every second I spend watching and re-watching it. It is available on youtube, just follow this link if you are curious about it (which you really should).
“A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.”

782,84979,1519757027,it was amazing,"4.5Wow. What an experience. This book is about Darcy putting aside his pride to love Elizabeth, and Elizabeth to put aside her prejudice to do the same.I can confirm that I also had to put aside my prejudices to read this book. I'm not a huge fan of the classics. I've kind of been traumatized by the classics in high school, when they made us read books like Great Expectations going into 9th grade and a Separate fucking Peace.And to be honest, they weren't bad books. But I fucking despised them because reading books in high school wasn't about the enjoyment factor. No, it was about analyzing the fuck out of every sentence and being tested on quotes!So you can see, I looked down on the classics.I saw them as difficult to understand.I saw them as generally stiff and boring.I saw them as unrelatable.I was scared to read them because when I did for class, I had a lot of trouble understanding. I became heavily reliant on SparkNotes. And I'll admit, I wanted to read this book because I kept hearing about how good it was. I felt like I should read just to say I read it.I was so psyched out about the whole ""It's a classic, I'm not going to understand anything"" that I had to restart it three times in the course of a year and a half. I was focusing so hard on trying to understand it that I actually didn't understand it.But once I let myself relax into it and just listen (audiobook), it was actually not difficult to understand. I got into it and I found that I rather enjoyed myself!! I can confidently say that there will be more Jane Austen books in my future ;-)And the narrator I listened to, Carolyn Seymour, was really good!Now, onto the details!!I hate Mrs. Bennet with a burning passion! I'll shred that woman in one second.Mr. Collins is also excessively annoying. I'm partial to Mr. Bennet.Jane, Bingley, and Darcy are dears!But Lizzie is my favorite! Beautiful bold woman! And now it's time to tear apart......Mrs. Bennet! Mrs. Bennet and her f*cking nerves!!Every time she spoke (audiobook), I got pissed. The narrator made her sound perfectly nasally too, which made everything more realistic.All she fucking cares about is marrying off her daughter....to anyone.Wickham is fucking sleazy playboy who just wants money? And he destroyed her daughter's reputation so her family can save it by paying him to marry her? No problemo! Mrs. Bennet's on board. She is so proud of her dumbass baby who was amazing enough to get married at 16. She hated Darcy for the longest time, but the second she found out Lizzie was marrying him, she was so excited about how rich Lizzie was going to be. She gave no flying fucks that she was handing her daughter off to a man whom she presumed to be a jerk! And when she basically trapped Lizzie in the room with Mr. Collins because she was so fucking desperate for him to propose to her! And then she put Mr. Collins first by insulting Lizzie because she refused his proposal!And she was always shitting on Charlotte's and other girls' appearance, saying how they are ""quite plain"" or ""not nearly as handsome"" as her daughters!!......as you can see, the list is long and doesn't end here.....On a happier note, I liked this so much that I also binge-watched Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube and I've watched the 2005 movie. I am happy that they took a lot of lines directly from the book :D",en

791,84979,1915190181,really liked it," Cuanto más conozco el mundo más me enoja, y todos los días confirmo mi creencia en la inconstancia de los caracteres humanos y en lo poco que se puede fiar de las apariencias de mérito o de talento.  Se hace difícil reseñar un clásico del cual ya está (casi) todo dicho, así que quiero concentrarme en mi opinión y no tanto en los elementos que describen al libro. Es, como la mayoría de los trabajos de Austen, una historia que se puede amar completamente por el desarrollo de los acontecimientos o vilipendiar porque los protagonistas carecen de sensualidad, cosa que lo hace aburrido para estos tiempos (o los lectores acostumbrados a estos tiempos). Sin embargo, creo que el problema pasa por la mala fama de ser un libro romántico en una época donde la definición del género está llena de contradicciones. Digo “mala fama” no porque un libro romántico sea de cuarta categoría (a pesar de que algunos lo son), sino porque me parece erróneo adjudicárselo a OyP con tanta soltura. Esta relectura abrió líneas de lectura que no había explorado y reafirmó que el objetivo principal de Austen era el de mostrar las ridiculeces que soportaba en esos años, usando como excusa la concertación de uno o varios matrimonios. Ese abanico que despliega en OyP lo vuelve más complicado, menos empalagoso y me sugiere por qué Austen nunca se casó, dejando a un lado que pueda confesarlo en alguna carta que todavía no leí. No la culpo.  Orgullo y prejuicio  cuenta la historia de la familia Bennet, residentes de Longbourn, que está compuesta por padre, madre y cinco hijas mujeres: Jane, Elizabeth (Lizzy), Mary, Catherine y Lydia. Debido a que las mujeres no pueden heredar propiedades y a la muerte del señor Bennet la casa se legaría a un pariente varón, la madre de las muchachas no piensa en otra cosa que en acomodarlas mediante matrimonios ventajosos. Así que, cuando Charles Bingley, un hombre muy acaudalado, se muda cerca de los Bennet, la noticia de su soltería pone en alerta los instintos casamenteros de la señora de Longbourn. Ahí empieza la historia. Bingley tomará partido por Jane y, a la vez, este tiene un amigo medio gruñón que será importante en la trama: Fitzwilliam Darcy. La novela transcurre entre bailes, visitas, cartas, chismes y comparaciones entre la ciudad y el campo. Eso está garantizado por Austen. Noté que en esta ocasión los sucesos se me hicieron más fluidos y, comparándolos con otros libros de la misma autora, hasta fueron más agradables. De acuerdo a mi punto de vista, OyP está trabajado lo justo y necesario y goza de más libertad narrativa que Emma,  por ejemplo. Hasta los personajes se sienten menos encorsetados en sus papeles y resultan más simpáticos, incluso si no lo son (estoy mirando a Collins de reojo, aunque admito que aporta la dosis de humor). El inicio se mete de lleno con el conflicto principal, es decir, la llegada de Bingley y su amigo Darcy, así que no introduce con lentitud. Eso me provocó dudas porque me daba la sensación de estar ante un libro troceado (hay cuestiones, como la relación entre el señor y la señora Bennet o las personalidades de las hermanas, que se hacen esperar), de esos en donde la información aparece mágicamente cuando la trama lo requiere, pero a la vez no. En la balanza pesó más la idea de que OyP es una novela que se desenvuelve sin la obligación de retratar todo en diez largas páginas sólo para que el lector pueda recorrer el resto sin sobresaltos. Me gustó que se tome el tiempo. Si no mencioné antes a Lizzy fue porque ella merecía su párrafo aparte. Es la verdadera protagonista de la historia ya que la mayoría de la narración se concentra en sus pensamientos y en su perspectiva. Lizzy odiará a Darcy por su aire reservado y orgulloso, sin olvidar que dice algo antipático sobre ella cuando la conoce. Y Darcy, por su parte, se mantiene distante de esa muchacha tan vivaz y contestadora. Me atrevo a decir que ella es una heroína bastante rara para la época. O, tal vez, yo me haya topado con pocas mujeres en la literatura de principios del siglo XIX que razonen tanto y tengan la capacidad de decidir qué hacer con sus vidas… a pesar de que las madres sean manojos de nervios andantes que las exponen como adornos en subasta. Al leer las salvajadas que exclama la señora Bennet (porque no habla, grita), toma sentido. De vuelta a Lizzy, me parece que le hace honor al pedestal de personajes literarios en donde está ubicada. Se avergüenza de la familia, se pasa de prejuiciosa, le cuesta pensar bien de la gente y está lejos de ser una sabelotodo. Austen nunca la presenta como un modelo a seguir, si no como un ser humano con errores y aciertos que busca desesperadamente la normalidad en un entorno que dedica horas y horas a hablar del matrimonio, la renta anual de X, vestidos y la vida de los vecinos, incluso en los momentos más delicados. Lizzy podría ser tranquilamente una mujer de este siglo atrapada en costumbres que hasta ella misma acepta, como el hecho de que una persona de rango inferior no pueda hablarle primero a una de rango superior y deba ser al revés. Me sorprendió encontrar (evidentemente, lo había olvidado) una descripción detallada de la indiferencia del señor Bennet hacia su esposa. En sus intercambios de opiniones se nota que a Bennet le importa un comino lo que le suceda a la señora, pero no había esperado que Austen le dedicara tiempo a ese matrimonio y que Lizzy fuera la que da la puntada final, en donde muestra su desilusión. Son párrafos agridulces y profundizan el comportamiento de Bennet en la novela. El “patriarca” de la casa pasa horas en la biblioteca e interviene para decidir… hasta que su voz se apaga. Los bocadillos que mete el señor Bennet se cuentan con los dedos y, a pesar de su hilaridad, transmiten la sensación de que él preferiría estar en cualquier otro lugar  menos  en esa casa llena de mujeres. En la primera lectura del libro lo vi con ojos más inocentes, pero ahora cambió un poco mi perspectiva. Con respecto a su esposa, sobrepasa los límites de mi paciencia si dejo de lado que se casó con el hombre equivocado. Me enoja que sólo piense en ganar esa carrera absurda que disputa con sus vecinas: “a ver quién establece a las mujeres primero”. Tiremos a nuestras hijas a los lobos con tal de que una alianza y una renta (de ambas partes) permitan su supervivencia, ya que si quedasen solteras traerían desgracias. Generalizo y uso “lobos” porque estas señoras que ofician de Cupido priorizan los ingresos del hombre, no la reputación. Ellos también sufren las presiones. (view spoiler)[ Basta con recordar a Catherine de Bourgh insistiendo en que Darcy debía casarse con su hija o a Bingley siendo persuadido por sus hermanas y el propio Darcy para que olvide a Jane.  (hide spoiler)]No puedo omitir el tema de la relación amorosa entre los protagonistas, más allá de que sea muy común hablar de ello. Me encanta la forma paulatina (view spoiler)[ (bueno, a Darcy le costó menos enamorarse)  (hide spoiler)] en la que estos dos tercos van cambiando los sentimientos desdeñosos por unos más positivos. En mis escenas favoritas siempre están ellos dos porque sus diálogos son chispeantes, incluso cuando pelean. Darcy trae polémica a la hora de opinar sobre él por las actitudes en las primeras páginas, pero creo que compensa las faltas en el carácter con lo que hace por Lizzy. Es más humano que sea imperfecto y no un depósito de cualidades que en la vida real brillan por su ausencia. Sostengo (no reseñé la primera lectura pero recuerdo qué me había faltado para las cinco estrellas) que el desenlace de la historia me pareció apresurado. En las últimas veinte páginas convergen todos los conflictos y se resuelven para que después Austen explique, en escasos párrafos, el destino de cada personaje. He observado este problema en otros libros de la autora y el más reciente fue  Emma.  Particularmente, me hubiera encantado saber más de Mary, un personaje que se mueve como una sombra y es censurada cuando aparece. Una cuestión nueva que advertí fue que Bingley tiene poca participación y me dejó con ganas de conocerlo más. Aparece bastante al inicio y después la narración se limita a proporcionar información sobre su accionar, sin ahondar en el momento clave que le corresponde. Creo que se lo pinta mejor a Collins con las cartas larguísimas que escribe y su charlatanería pomposa. Estas cosas que señalo no desmitifican a Austen (para mí sigue siendo prácticamente indiscutible), sino que, a mis ojos, permiten considerar cuál de sus obras se acerca a la perfección, si eso existe. El hecho de que pueda aburrir o no pertenece al campo de la percepción del lector. Este libro me pareció muy dinámico aunque eso no justifique el final a las corridas, claro está.  Orgullo y prejuicio  vale la pena el esfuerzo. No es un libro para todos (no existe el libro “para todos”, según mi criterio), pero al menos se puede utilizar para probar si Jane Austen se convierte en una escritora favorita o en una que conviene ignorar, pensando en una generación de lectores que probablemente la conozca más por las adaptaciones cinematográficas que por las novelas en sí. Como dato curioso, a Austen la descubrí así, porque la escuela nunca la mencionó y, en mi carrera, la pasan olímpicamente por alto. Algo me dice que su género y la asociación con libros dedicados a un público netamente femenino incentivan el olvido. Me causa extrañeza porque a las hermanas Brontë* se las podría  acusar  de lo mismo y, sin embargo, obtienen más reconocimiento. Supongo que forma parte de las numerosas incongruencias de este mundo tan grande llamado “literatura”. Después de este lloriqueo lector- académico que solté, sólo me resta decir que adoro este libro y no hay argumento o desconsideración que me importe a la hora de hacerlo.(*) No tengo ningún problema con las Brontë, sólo las usé como ejemplo por los contrastes con el tratamiento que se le da a Jane Austen.

“If you're filled with affectionYou're too shy to conveyMeditate my direction”
Obviously not a quote from P&P but I think it is not entirely inappropriate, though possibly mortifying for hardcore Janeites (imagine John Travolta as Mr. Darcy). Still, I must confess it often pleases me to be at variance, “a most country-town indifference to decorum”, you could say. I have good news for all you Janeites, though, this is likely to be my last Jane Austen review. No, not on account of any disapprobation of Ms. Austen, heaven forbid! I just happen to have read and reviewed all her major novels; except her involuntary collaboration with Mr. Seth Grahame-Smith on  Pride and Prejudice and Zombies of which I only read one or two chapters, and consider to be an impertinence which merits the severest reproof*. So I hope you can read this—my adieu to Jane Austen books—with tolerable tranquillity.Does anybody need—or even want—a synopsis of P&P? I will cobble up a quick one in any event. Basically, Mr. Darcy (Fitzwilliam to…nobody!) is a gentleman whose upper lip is so stiff, his lower one complains of doing all the work. He meets our heroine Ms. Elizabeth Bennet and notices her fine eyes but is too haughty to express his admiration. Elizabeth is, after all, relatively speaking, a plebe. Our Liz, of course, takes an instant dislike to him which quickly grows into almost obsessive hatred and naturally progresses into burning love by the end of the book. Jane Austen clearly enjoyed stacking the odds against these two crazy kids getting together, and is quite devious with her plotting the unsmooth course of their true love. Pride and Prejudice is deservedly Austen’s most popular work, it is triumphant in all departments. As a romcom, a comedy of manners, social satire, and romance it is pretty much flawless. Her prose is always a thing of beauty, her dialogue is wonderful and often very funny. The characters of this novel are the stuff of legend of course. Huffy Darcy and free-spirited (possibly hipster) Lizzie have already been mentioned. As the characters are my favorite aspect of the book, let me just make a list of the noteworthy ones:Jane Bennet – Permanently placid and imperturbable. Is Jane some kind of space cadet or a proto-hippy?Mrs. Bennet (first name unknown) - Elizabeth’s mom. She is indecorously obsessed with every potential suitor’s GBPs per annum. “What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Ka-ching!” Mr. Bennet (first name unknown) – has a nice line in sarcasm and dry wit. Completely ineffectual in emergencies. Not someone to go on dangerous missions with.Mr. Collins  – Hilariously pompous clergyman, with his “mixture of servility and self-importance”. He comes up with some of the novel’s funniest lines.Lady Catherine de Bourgh - Super bossy and snobbish noblewoman. Her scene with Liz near the end of the book counts as a kind of epic climax.I won’t bother with Lydia, Kitty, Mary, Bingley, Wickham and whatnot.Good gracious! How I have rattled on senselessly paragraphs upon paragraphs! At the end of the day I just wish to prevail upon you to read Pride and Prejudice, if you have thus far been insensible of the felicity to be had from the volume. I am sure you will like it prodigiously.And so ends my series of Jane Austen reviews. Alas, no possibility of season 2 or a DVD/Blu-ray release, however, I have enjoyed my journey hither exceedingly. Adieu, my friends, adieu!* Honestly, this Smith dude just interspersed some juvenile zombie and martial arts rubbish into various points of Austen’s novel and sold container loads of the infernal thing. All done without Ms. Austen’s concurrence, of course. I hope her descendants get a share.Credit: Librivox (free!) Audiobook read by Elizabeth Klett, the best audiobook narrator in the multiverse.",en
793,84979,2321685450,liked it,"No me odiéis por ponerle esta nota, por favor (que incluso me atrevería a decir que es un 2.5 más que un 3). Lo primero que siempre digo, es muy importante meterse en el contexto para leer un clásico. No se puede leer con los ojos que leemos un libro que salió ayer, ni juzgarlo por las normas establecidas ahora mismo. Os recomiendo informaros sobre la época y la autora antes de adentraros en cualquier clásico. Teniendo esto en cuenta, os voy a contar mi opinión. Lo primero que tengo que decir es que puede que mis expectativas hayan hecho un flaco favor a la historia. Y aunque es una historia muy conocida, no sabía mucho de ella... así que pensé que me sorprendería muchísimo pero no fue así. Y ¡era de mi género favorito! De verdad, pensé que nada podía fallar... pero obviamente no fue como pensaba xDLo que más quiero destacar es la narrativa de la autora. Leerla ha sido una gozada. Y aunque nos describe todo a la perfección y he adorado sus descripciones, hay muchísimo diálogo entre sus personajes, cosa que ha agilizado mucho la lectura. También he agradecido que los capítulos fueran cortos, eso hacía que siempre quisiera leer un capítulo más. Y por supuesto me ha encantado la ironía con la que la autora trata la historia (y que vemos gracias a Lizzie, adoré su sentido del humor), ya que se desarrolla dentro de una sociedad opresiva hacia las mujeres (1813), donde solo valen para casarse, y aquí nos encontramos a una protagonista a la que le es bastante indiferente en ese tema. Y he aquí el toque feminista de la historia. Para ser el siglo XIX, tenemos un personaje femenino que busca todo lo contrario a lo establecido por su sociedad, y que Jane Austen critica con dureza, desafiando los modelos sociales impuestos de su época. Y obviamente he disfrutado mucho con Lizzie, aunque a veces me abrumaba su monólogo interno. Podía llegar a ser muy pesada...Y hasta aquí todo lo bueno, ahora lo malo.El libro es aburrido hasta decir basta. El conflicto me pareció absurdo y para mí poco sostenible durante un libro de casi 500 páginas. Si hubiéramos quitado 200 páginas hubiera sido mucho mejor y se hubiera contado la misma historia. ¿Qué a mí me haya aburrido significa que es un mal libro? No, simplemente es cuestión de gustos, y el tema que trata este libro en concreto no era capaz de captar mi atención a pesar de que estaba disfrutando bastante de la lectura (con esto me refiero a que es muy bonito leer a Austen, se disfruta mucho su prosa). Otra cosa que no me ha gustado es... Darcy. Lo siento, de verdad, pero ¡qué personaje más irritante! Sin duda era la intención de la autora, pero no podía comprenderle. Obviamente, entiendo por qué gusta tanto este libro y soy capaz de apreciarlo, aunque no haya sido para mí. Y ya está. Me he enrollado más de lo normal pero porque no quiero que se malinterpreten mis palabras y quería que quedara todo más o menos claro. Si algo no queda lo suficientemente bien explicado, no me importará contestaros en los comentarios ^^. También decir que no descarto para nada leer más de la autora es un futuro, pero sin duda no en uno cercano. Lo que no sabría es cual leer el siguiente. ¿Recomendaciones? ",es
794,84979,648494960,it was amazing,"Jane Austen’s tools are tweezers and a nail file. Tolstoy built cityscapes; Dostoyevsky dug sewer systems; Joyce made funhouses; Kafka put up prisons; Cervantes created carnivals. Austen crafts ivory figurines, incredibly lifelike portraits that fit in the palm of your hand.When you read Pride and Prejudice you see the novel in its barest form. Her prose has no pyrotechnics, her descriptions have little poetry. Word-play, fantastic events, bizarre characters, cliff-hangers, and elaborate plots are similarly absent. When you read this book you realize that these tools are not only unnecessary, but can distract from the craft of the novel.In all of the annals of social science—the ethnographies of anthropology, the studies of sociology—there has never been an observer of social life more keen than Ms. Austen. What we have here is one of the best accounts of marriage customs ever written. That information alone would make this book invaluable.But of course, this is no academic treatise; it is a novel, and a brilliant one at that. Unlike other authors, who use the dialogue to present information about the plot, for Austen the dialogue is the plot. It is a story of information and misunderstanding. Who thinks what, who knows what, who tells what to whom—all form the intimate tapestry of events that propel this book forward to its merry conclusion.Austen also excels at omitting unnecessary information. She never tells instead of shows. She does not beleaguer the reader with descriptions of personalities, or even of appearances. Descriptions of setting are similarly kept to the barest minimum; in fact, they are almost apologetic.The scenes of our greatest struggles and triumphs aren’t always aboard a whaling ship or before the gates of Troy. Sometimes they are conversations held over the soft plunking of a piano-forte",en
795,84979,356900841,it was amazing,"I can say nothing about this novel that has not been said a hundred times over on this site. In fact, my own brief, empirical survey indicates that this is the novel which has been read by the largest number of my goodreads friends. A summary is therefore redundant, and despite having just read it for the umpteenth time, I will not review it. Yet, I cannot just let it sit there on my favourites shelf without sending it, and Jane Austen, a few words of love.Jane Austen was my first love in the world of English literature, and she has been a constant love these 25 years or so. I keep on coming back to her novels – Pride and Prejudice six or seven times now. It is clever, heartwarming, funny and English. I could include a hundred lines from it that are brilliant, but picking one or two would be almost as unfair as calling this novel my favourite of her six princesses (which I do anyway).I adore Austen’s ironies, witticisms and sarcasm; I am astonished at her ability to make me see new things about her characters every time I read one of her novels although I’d sworn I knew them all intimately (Mr. Collins, for instance, was utterly annoying to me the first few times; now I laugh at him, with much condescension); I am in awe of the fact that she wrote these novels 200 years ago and that they are as fresh, relevant, entertaining and wonderful today as they were back then. I inhabit her universe with a rare sense of glee, acknowledging her genius yet knowing every nook and cranny because I’ve visited it so often (and basking in this knowingness; familiarity does not breed contempt in Austen’s case). I feel a profound sense of gratitude that Jane Austen existed at all. There really is none above her.",en

""Es una verdad mundialmente reconocida que un hombre soltero, poseedor de una gran fortuna, necesita una esposa.""
Quisiera señalar un momento en el que Darcy me ha hecho reír a carcajadas por lo ingenioso y mordaz que fue el comentario y mas que nada por la certeza del mismo:""...La imaginación de las mujeres vuela. Salta de la admiración al amor y del amor al matrimonio en un momento..."" -pàg 55 (capítulo VI)mi situación sentimental...Este 2do encuentro con Orgullo y Prejuicio me ha dado varias sorpresas, como que:-Mi yo de 14 años era una romántica empedernida lo encontraba increíblemente romántico en todos los sentidos -cuando mi yo de 18 años no tanto--Darcy es un pelele engreído pero que la voz narrativa hace posible el saber de sus sentimientos e intenciones con Lizzie, de igual forma cuando este decide ser pedante con ella solo porque si... como un ""mecanismo"" para ocultar sus verdaderos sentimientos -con lo que me identifique 100%--Los diálogos entre Lizzie y Darcy tienen tan buena vibra que casi los comparo -pero no tanto- con los de Jane/Mr. Roshester -que si se traían un rollo del bueno--La confesión de amor de Darcy a Lizzie, en su momento me deje llevar por lo de ""la amo ardientemente"" y bla bla bla.... pero como destaqué antes que Darcy le preguntara a Lizzie por su salud me ha parecido lo más hilarante del libro.-Esta vez sí me di tiempo de leer la introducción de Ivana Mollo -maravillosa en todos los sentidos- y en donde destaca constantemente lo difícil que era y es aun categorizar Orgullo y Prejuicio en un género en específico... hoy en día es mucho más fácil, pues todos concuerdan con que es

Classic books used to always intimidate me, however since one of my new year's reading resolutions is to explore different genres more, I took it upon myself to pick up this classic novel that almost everyone seemed to genuinely love and enjoyed. ELIZABETH BENNET, who is now one of my favourite female heroines ever is clever, sharp, witty and confident (all the attributes i hope for myself lol) and I truly admire her headstrong attitude and her ability to make decisions for herself without being easily swayed or manipulated by others. Her relationship with Mr. Darcy made me giggle and smile, and though if I were Jane Austen, I  really  would include more swoony Darcy scenes *smirks*, I still loved the conclusion of this book.

803,84979,1295960809,it was amazing,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that an author possessing immense talent and a good story to tell, must be in want of a reader like me to bestow upon it the laurels it merits. How else will anyone hear of it?OK, so P&P may not need my help. The word is likely already out. What that means is that I can scurry around the periphery of the story itself, make a few small points, and move on with near certitude that Miss Austen will have an audience regardless.It had been quite a while since I’d read anything written so long ago. Of course, the language was very different, and for me that was part of the appeal. The musicality of it must owe to the baroque style of the time as well as to the skills of the writer. Her words were precise and descriptors well-chosen. This passage about the piano-playing abilities of the lightly regarded middle sister is but one of many examples:
""Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.""
This example is also one of many instances where an ""air"" or ""manner"" was defined, or a ""countenance"", ""bearing"" or ""nature"". Much was read into facial expressions, too. Remember, this came from a time before “show, don’t tell.”As an older vintage depiction, there were also big differences in the social norms of the day -- the mores and the protocols. It’s a cliché to point out that Austen’s books are about manners, but it’s true nonetheless. Courtships, for instance, had rigid rules that are almost laughable to our modern ways of thinking. And the language was so stylized and indirect. Subtitles would make for a good skit, like in Annie Hall where Alvy is talking to Annie early on about some abstract artsy thing while his real train of thought was, shall we say, less chaste. Monetary details, class, and family reputation were important determinants in the matches of the day, too. Books like this give us great historical insight into the social contracts and conventions.There’s no need for me to repeat in any detail what most people already know or could discover somewhere else better than this. Elizabeth Bennet is great. Mr. Darcy emerges. Jane and Bingley are charming, though nearly victims of a misunderstanding. Mr. Collins is an obsequious toad. Mr. Bennet is a bit too laissez-faire with a daughter or two who needed tighter reins. Mrs. Bennet is a woman “of weak understanding and illiberal mind.” (I should have been using Miss Austen’s wording throughout. It’s not like I could improve upon it.) Lydia is heedless and Wickham is evil. Of these latter two it was said, “how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue.” The whole story is essentially how these characters play off of one another and sort out their relationships and their lives. Yes, and it’s told really well. It’s more than just the costume drama enthusiasts with their immoderate taste for romanticism that sustain this as a classic.I’ll close this hodgepodge hash of a review by introducing a fun new parlor game involving a mishmash of P&P characters. Pish posh you say? Well hear me out. First of all, if you haven’t already done so, read the book and learn the traits and idiosyncrasies of the characters. They range widely over multiple dimensions. Then take turns mapping these characters to the other players in the game. Composites are encouraged. For instance, my lovely bride of 30 years is 0.872 Elizabeth for her perception, quick wit, and probity; 0.127 Jane for her beauty and good nature; and 0.001 Mrs. Bennet for having watched on more than one occasion that show where bridezillas rate other bridezillas’ weddings, critically and cattily. Then look to see which participants turn red with embarrassment, or even redder with anger. Note: This is my review from a few years ago and may seem like a float.

808,84979,1919250883,it was amazing," Contains minor spoilers, read at your own risk   ""From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."" ""You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.""   	I recognize that under no circumstances should Pride and Prejudice be considered as the greatest work of literature, but that doesn't mean we should underestimate Jane Austen, who if you ask me was way ahead of her time. I shall talk about my experience with this book. I understand why so many people dislike it and I admit that I  too  was prejudiced against Jane Austen, even a sworn enemy I dare say, yet here I am giving her book 5 stars after five years give or take since I first read it.  	The reader should keep in mind  when  Pride and Prejudice was written and the social status of females at that time. Although, it becomes clear from the very first pages the fact that females had to get married and that this was their ""goal"" in life, Austen creates one of the greatest heroines in literature; Elizabeth Bennet, a strong female who doesn't care to serve the hard boiled truth in your face. She is a smart and a very dynamic character, who dares to refuse the proposals of two men. A woman who isn't afraid to stand up to men (& women for a matter of fact) and speak her thoughts freely. On the other hand, she is quite prejudiced against Mr Darcy.  	As for Mr Darcy, in the beginning he was the rudest, most selfish, proud and arrogant character. However,  after  Elizabeth rejected him, heartbroken though he was, he took all of that and changed for her. He also, valued her decision and respected it, he even apologized and left unlike Mr Collins who made her repeat herself more than once just to make sure that she wasn't joking. Men not taking no for an answer, does it ring any bells?  	What I loved about this book other than the marvelous characters' development was the fact that their love didn't happen in a blink of an eye, instead it took time and it came gradually. (21st century romance writers please take notes!) They balanced each other and in the end their love story was epic. [Lastly, the secondary characters like Jane, Mr Bingley were interesting to follow] 	So, this is a story where the main plot is about love so do not expect the deepest philosophical dialogues or spiritual level life changing material. Personally, I loved it,  I  who used to detest it and its values towards women. After a long time I reached the last page and felt sad that it ended, I literally slowed down my pace of reading in order not to finish it sooner.   Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you? You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.  ",en

These classics always manage to make me really happy I’m not living in that time period. It always feels a bit strange when I read classics because even if I know how women were considered and how they were viewed it still feels strange to read about heroines that obviously strongly believed in that system because they were born and raised in it. Same thing with the separation of classes, main themes in Austen's books. I really liked this novel, like I’ve always liked Austen’s book. I can’t decide if I prefer this one or Emma for now.

816,84979,152470719,it was amazing,"Pride & Prejudice was significantly influenced by Sam Richardson's 1749 blockbuster Pamela. In both books, a boorish man is reformed through the protagonist's refusal to fall for his original cockishness. And in both books, a late and great scene features some bitch trying to talk the guy out of his reformation. There are differences too, of course: Darcy is just kindof an ass, not a wannabe rapist. But here's the biggest difference: Pride & Prejudice, starkly unlike Pamela, doesn't suck. After the fumbling, experimental early novels Pamela, Tom Jones, Tristram Shandy and even The terrific but (let's face it) charmingly harebrained Monk, Pride & Prejudice, with its fully-formed characters and tightly-wound plot, is a revelation. Only Defoe had written novels this tightly conceived, and his characterization is wooden. Elizabeth, though...after characters like Pamela, Elizabeth Bennett is shockingly alive and real.Pamela, like many 18th-century female characters (sup Evelina), is passive. She does nothing but behave as piously as she can in her constrained situation, hoping that'll be enough to get some guy to deign to pay attention to her. To me, Elizabeth registers as a sharp break with that tradition; her willfulness, her pride, her insistence on her own way, hits me as a completely new development in the English novel.And you get into her head, too, which is another innovation that belongs to Austen. She invented free indirect speech, which is when the tone of the writing changes to match the personality of the character whose viewpoint you're reading about. It's actually so prevalent in modern writing now that it's hard to even explain. The effect is subtle but huge. It's the difference between a stilted, old-timey book and a book that makes you identify with its characters.We generally give the 1800s the blanket name ""Victorian lit,"" which is confusing because technically it starts in 1837, which means nothing literature-wise. For me, when we think of Victorian literature, we think of what started with Jane Austen: real people living real lives, that you're allowed into. You might as well call it Austenian lit. If you're a super Austen geek, I can recommend What Matters in Jane Austen?: Twenty Crucial Puzzles Solved, a fun and very deep dive into Austen's world; the fun lesson there is just how utterly Austen knew what she was doing. Great stuff.",en
817,84979,648667196,it was amazing,"Jane Austen retrata, con ironía y un eficaz sentido del humor, la idiosincrasia de la burguesía inglesa durante la época de la regencia, que constituye un puente entre el período georgiano y el victoriano. Con tintes gloriosamente folletinescos (en ningún caso peyorativos), Austen construye una trama perfecta, en ocasiones casi teatral, en la cual cada actor tiene su razón de ser, su posición exacta, todos ellos deliciosamente delineados y adorados, como si la autora no hubiera querido dejar nada al azar y pretendiese (consiguiéndolo) situarse en la misma piel del sufrido señor Bennet (sin duda mi favorito) y de William Collins, Charlotte Lucas, Fitzwilliam Darcy o Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Bennet... Un verdadero panteón de prototipos sociales, maravillosos ejemplos de la admirable devoción de Austen por sus personajes. No hay espacio para la improvisación, sino un estudio psicológico pormenorizado y una planificación sólida y enérgica del argumento. Es a través de esta densidad como Austen consigue una obra intemporal: ¿no son orgullo, hipocresía y prejuicio ingredientes que perduran en la evolución del ser humano, en sus intentos (constantes por fallidos) de constituir un entramado de simulaciones sociales que se mantenga en el tiempo? De este microcosmos circunscrito a la Inglaterra de Jorge III, de este escenario cotidiano y familiar donde el 'problema' del amor es abordado como una convención más, se infiere un tratado completo sobre el comportamiento humano, sobre la fragilidad y debilidad intrínsecos a todas las comunidades 'civilizadas'.

821,84979,115608188,it was amazing,"Once again, I am reviewing Pride and Prejudice from a more aged, if less revolutionary, point of view. One could well imagine that a first read in hatred and a second in love will result in third time's the charm of an absolute favorite, but I am satisfied enough with the multitude of other's yays to not bemoan my lack too much. What can be said about this work that I found neither in Sense and Sensibility nor Northanger Abbey: it sustains. Here is an intersection of social prestige, self-held ethic, flagrant dehumanization and, its only truly effective antithesis, dialectical mortification, that may be faced wherever whenever human beings convert themselves with open eyes and eager hearts into that imaginary concept known as worth. Prejudice: how do you choose. Pride: how do you choose yourself.A measure of critics deem this structure a fairy tale. I will take that on and more, for there is the figure of Cinderella on the one and the fey who steal your children on the other. Wit and irony survive us as a laughing in the dark, and I cannot imagine this narrative would have thrived half as well without due credit to the plague it presents just beyond the grand estate. We are talking of a civilization that, once upon a time, ruled the world in ways we are still bowing under today, and with its kingdom thought it best to stratify its self to make even more obscene the power of its princes. A gentleman in Austen's pages could not order an off with her head, but if anything may be learned from the likes of Catherine Morland and of Bluebeard, it is that the game and its stakes may be cultivated as easily in the sun shining on a rejected proposal as in the chooser of the wrong breed of choice dying in the streets of Meryton.These days, both princess and prince equally charm, but I have not and do not and will not return repeatedly in film and writ for the sake of them alone. I come back to watch two figures stay the course toward a mistaken lighthouse, running around the 'Me, me, me. I, I, I. Them, them, them' from which respective self respects will not allow the easy escapes of solipsism, sadism, and bad faith. I chase this in life as much as I do in fiction, and if my vernacular is more global and my paradigms more political, it as natural a consequence as any would find after two hundred years had passed through a particular species termed humanity.Whenever I yet again begin to bow under the seeming futility that I have changed so irrefutably that what was once loved must forever be lost, I return to works such as this, a little wiser, perhaps, and certainly with a larger vocabulary. Years later, my joy mulls in the cask of awareness of how many gaps Elizabeth carefully stepped across, how many slings of stagnation Darcy dodged, how easily all these values known as gender and class and this human being can be estimated at a worth far less than another would have wrecked them both had either of them been unwilling to wrack themselves. If it is a fairy tale, it is one where both acknowledge how large a part their furies played, just how much destruction they can wield. You cannot begin to comprehend a prejudice towards good, whether in communication, understanding, or effort to humanize, without that.A fine wine, this one.---1/11/2012I'm so very glad that I realized that I had been in neither the right mood nor the right mind to appreciate this lovely gem when I first read it. Otherwise my previous one star rating would have continued its miserable existence, without much insight to its reasons. I have never grinned so much while reading something, nor laughed out loud so frequently. Yes, it is the soap opera of soap operas. But it is so delightful and witty and Elizabeth is the most entertainingly heartfelt person to ever relate to. Not to mention Mr. Darcy, whose complete turnaround was the most adorably efficiently thing I have ever seen. It was like The Constant Wife, but with a happier ending. And yes, happy endings are one of my guilty pleasures, so long as their progress is done well and without ridiculous amounts of emotional frippery. I have to pay a certain due to the less loved characters, as the joy of a happy ending can only be matched by the satisfaction of seeing such characters getting their comeuppances. And boy did Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine get what they deserved. I'm suddenly tempted to reread everything that I gave a low rating. Well. Maybe just the ones whose average review is rather high. Or at least the ones with no satisfactory review to explain my decision. Gah. Never mind that. Too pleased with myself for deigning to reread this.",en

––He luchado en vano. Ya no puedo más. Soy incapaz de contener mis sentimientos. Permítame que le diga que la admiro y la amo apasionadamente.
  PROPÓSITO DE AÑO CUMPLIDOEsta lectura fue uno de mis propósitos de año, dije no va a terminar el año si antes no leo Orgullo y Prejuicio y YEY lo cumplí. Cuando lea otros libro y lo citen no me sentiré tan ignorante e inculta.Que difícil es calificar un clásico de la literatura romántica y más dar mi opinión pero lo voy hacer con el respeto que merece. Debo confesar que el comienzo fue lo que más me costó casi me quedo dormida la verdad es que si me pareció aburrido, demasiadas descripciones la narrativa o sea todo pero conforme me fui acostumbrando todo mejoró. También debo confesar que esperaba más romance, más interacción entre los protagonistas porque hubo largos lapsos del libro donde estuvieron separados sin contacto alguno.Más que una novela de romance es una crítica, observación y descripción de la sociedad inglesa del siglo XIX, la interacción de las familias cuales eran sus principales prioridades, que siento que siguen siendo las mismas pero que se ven un poco más frívolas en aquella época,; las apariencias, el que dirán, la posición social que tanto dinero y propiedades tienes, que hoy en día sigue siendo lo mismo pero más disfrazado de que el amor, la amistad y los valores ""es lo más importante"". También trata sobre los prejuicios de la gente como se juzga sólo con la apariencia de las personas o lo que se dice de ellos sin darte la oportunidad de conocerlos y fórmate tu propia opinión, el orgullo que nos hace sentirnos superiores a los demás.Hablando de los personajes principales Elizabeth Bennet no me agradó tanto, no me pareció tan divertida e inteligente, era un tanto soberbia y demasiado prejuiciosa para mi gusto muchas veces me cansaba su actitud y tampoco me creí el amor que profesó a Mr Darcy si me hizo un tanto calculador e interesado aunque al final se enmendó pero sigue siendo un NOPE.Mr Darcy es otra historia él si me encantó LO AMÉ, ya entendí el amor que tantas le tienen, es el pionero de hombres perfectos en la literatura romántica pone los cimientos. Me hubieran gustado más escenas de él cada vez que salía era lo mejor del libro y si sale un 20% del libro es mucho.Mr Darcy por siempre en la historia las escenas finales me gustaron mucho y sacaron varias risas ay es que la mamá de Lizzy es todo un caso.Tenía bastantes expectativas con este libro y sobre todo porque te lo venden como un libro de romance cuando NO LO ES.

823,84979,947225270,it was amazing,"Pride and Prejudice est le plus grand roman de la littérature anglaise.

Elle s'opposait violement à l'esclavage qui était la base de la richesse de l'empire britannique avant l'âge industriel. Cependant dans Pride and Prejudice la seule injustice sociale décriée par l'auteur est le manque de respect qu'avaient les gens de la grande noblesse pour les gens de la petite noblesse.La raison pour la popularité toujours grandissante dans le monde Anglophone de Pride et Prejudice est le brio avec lequel Austen montre l'hypocrisie, la malhonnête des gens envers leurs proches et le manque de remords qu'avaient des personnages quand ils enfonçaient des couteaux dans les dos de leurs amis.

824,84979,27741181,it was amazing,"April 2016: This is the second in my series of reviews wherein I get weird and write them in the form of letters to the characters. I’m re-reading all of Jane Austen’s books in 2016, and it shall be glorious. One every two months means March was Pride and Prejudice month, and Pride and Prejudice is my favorite of Austen’s books, predictably. I was really looking forward to reading it again for the first time since 2010, and especially listening to the audiobook that Audible just released, narrated by Rosamund Pike. It was a truly wonderful listening experience, and I highly recommend it. Links to previous reviews in this series down below, after the review. (Spoilers for a two hundred year old book to follow. Seriously, all the spoilers. Don’t read this if you haven’t read P&P yet. Which you absolutely should, it’s scrumptious.)– – –Dear Mr. Bennet,In writing to you this fine evening, I’m reminded of a line once spoken by one of my other most favorite fictional characters, John Crichton: “I love hangin’ with you, man.”I know that I should find your shallow choice in wives disturbing, and the way you wind up both your wife and daughters, torturing them by dangling what they want in front of them, and only giving it to them once they believe they’ll never have it is sort of patronizing, but I just like you so much. I like the way you choose to find humor in your silly and ignorant relations instead of becoming angry and depressed. I love the way you love Elizabeth. It cracks me the hell up how you keep insisting that Wickham is your favorite son-in-law, just exactly because he is so useless.You’re a glass half full kind of guy, and I like ya.– – –Dear Mary,Honey baby child, the piano . . . it ain’t your calling. Perhaps you can take up painting instead? Embroidery? Uh, haberdashery? Horseback riding?You know, if you were alive today instead of Regency England, you’d probably be a knitter with cats, or maybe a gamer shut-in. Maybe you could have found yourself another gamer shut-in to marry, or maybe you’d be a self-identified ace. Who knows!But as is, it’s a good thing you had not one but two older sisters who married wealthy so that you could continue to do whatever the hell it is you do for as long as you choose to do it. Other weirdo young ladies in similar situations I’m sure were not as lucky.– – –Dear Kitty,Meow.– – –Dear Bingley,You’re a sweet guy and all but, like, grow a spine. You know what I’m not even mad, because this is you:– – –Dear Mr. Collins,Dude, I feel like it might be too late for you because you are thoroughly ridiculous, and it seems to be baked in. I think I’m just going to pull a Mr. Bennet and allow myself to be quietly amused by your pomposity and utter inability to correctly judge the world around you. (You like Lady Catherine? Really?? I think this is probably more a case of you judging people based entirely on their status and outside markers rather than who they actually are, which is the same reason you couldn’t even realize that Elizabeth was actually responding with a real ‘No’ to your marriage proposal, not once, not twice, but THREE FRICKIN’ TIMES.)Actually, you’re a key part of the narrative, so at least pat yourself on the back for that. You perfectly represent, in exaggerated form of course, exactly the type of attitude Austen was so clearly interested in satirizing. The book wouldn’t be the same without you.- - -Dear Charlotte,Unsung heroine of this novel, you are. You are bright and kind and considerate of your friends. You were plain in a time when a woman’s value was entirely entwined with her potential to be a wife, and her potential to be a wife dependent on her beauty and wealth. If the hapless Mr. Collins hadn’t come along, you might have continued on into spinsterhood, secure only in the knowledge that you would be more and more of a burden to your parents, and after they were gone, whatever family you had left who might take you in. And if you had none of them? Who even knows.And despite all of that, you remained positive and pragmatic, and thus were able to note and seize the opportunity for matrimony when it became available to you. I have no doubt you were the architect behind Mr. Collins transferring his affections from Lizzie to yourself, as opposed to one of her three remaining sisters.Also, even though your best friend seriously judged you for marrying Mr. Collins, you kept your head and forgave her, because though she too is a woman in this world and subject to its whims, she also happens to be beautiful and the richest man in the story is completely in love with her. If only you, too, were that lucky.And yet, I really don’t think you are jealous, which is in the end why I like you so much. You take your weird little husband and make do, and you find the bright side, which is that you who never thought you would be married, have your own home to run, and a safety and security you never imagined you would possess.- - -Dear Lady Catherine,Elizabeth herself said it best. I can do no better:“And I certainly never shall give [a promise not to marry Mr. Darcy]. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”“You can now have nothing farther to say . . . You have insulted me in every possible method.”“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude . . . have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern — and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”Burrrrrrrrrrn.- - -Dear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner,Just writing to ask if you guys want to hang one weekend or something. I don’t know, go up to lake country, get a tour of a winery, ride horses. What do you guys do all day anyway? Whatevs. You seem like cool people, and you play a huge part in getting Darcy and Elizabeth to accept one another, so I feel like I owe you one.Do you like mini-golf? Let’s play mini-golf.- - -Dear Georgiana,I feel like you and Elizabeth are best friends now. You’re best friends now, right? Please tell me you’re best friends.Don’t tell me if you’re not best friends.Don’t.- - -Dear Louisa Hurst,Nobody remembers you exist.

You produced such two excellent daughters in the beginning there, two daughters you literally did not even have to educate or try at all for them to turn out amazing, and then after Mary was sort of a wash (like, just a completely neutral human being right there), when it came time for the last two daughters to pop out, all the atoms in existence felt it was only fair, and so you know: Kitty and Lydia happened.I find this comforting.- - -Dear Lydia,In the book, you are entirely a representation of silly and thoughtless frivolity, and your actions almost cause real harm to your family. Most of the film representations are faithful to that idea of your character. Jena Malone does a particularly good job of it in the 2005 version starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen. But my favorite version of your character is actually the Lydia Bennet in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, which manages to keep the core of that silliness and frivolity all the while turning you into a fully realized, human character. It sort of betrays the idea of your character as a condemnation of the celebration of ignorance. But it still works, because much like the way she judges Mr. Darcy, LBD has Lizzie realize she’s been judging her little sister as well, even though it still allows room for you to be flawed. But I like that it actually lets you grow as a character, which your role in the book doesn’t really allow for.(Satirical representations aren’t allowed to be real people.)(Sorry if this is the first time you’re hearing about you being a fictional character and all, but a little identity crisis might actually be good for you.)- - -Dear Jane,You are such an example of optimism and selfless thought and action, I’m not sure why it’s only now as I’m typing you this letter that I realize you’re pretty much Lydia’s foil. And even if that’s the case, I like that your creator doesn’t let you get away with being portrayed as some kind of perfect angel. It’s not as simple as Lydia-Bad, Jane-Good. In fact, it’s your trusting and open nature–treating all the same and loving equally, even if not deserved–that allows for Bingley to believe Mr. Darcy (and indeed, for Mr. Darcy to believe in the first place) when he says that you hold no real regard for him.Your reticence and tendency to keep your feelings to yourself are certainly flaws, but they’re not exactly flaws one can condemn, which I think makes you an even more interesting character. Unthinking trust can be as hurtful as unthinking selfishness in the right circumstances. Your personality also contrasts nicely with Elizabeth’s, in that her tendency to pass judgment is only made to seem more extreme when in comparison to your inability to do so. It also makes her feel protective of you, and I do love good sisterly love in my fiction.I do think Mr. Bennet is right, though. Your servants are going to rob you and Bingley blind. I hope there’s someone there to protect you two dingleberries from yourselves.- - -Dear Elizabeth,Get it, girl.- - -Dear Mr. Darcy,You magnificent bastard. I have such complicated and intense feelings for you. Basically, you’re the reason this is my favorite of Miss Austen’s novels, and not for the reason that most people probably expect.Most people probably expect me to say that I love you so deeply because you are so romantic and beautiful and how dreamy. And yes, that is a part of it. Your strong feelings for Elizabeth, even at the height of your foolish behavior, are extremely attractive to me. And afterwards, when you’ve had time to think things over and start treating other people like human beings, your behavior is out of control sexy. The way you restrain yourself even though your feelings haven’t changed, in fact they have only grown stronger, because you don’t believe that hers have. The way that you go out of your way to make people feel good about themselves. Actually smiling. Doing good deeds so huge they’re almost inappropriate, solely because of love, and without hope that anyone will ever know about it. Showing that you are capable of thoughtful reflection, and that you are able to change and admit when you are wrong.Yes, all of those things are beautiful and I would marry you in a heartbeat, thank you asking.But what really draws me to you is not a romantic ideal, but that I see a lot of myself in you. I don’t idealize you, I identify with you.I can’t even tell you how many people have told me that when they first met me, they thought I hated them. So many people. Many of them my close friends now, who are only my close friends now because of extended periods of time spent together out of both of our control. I cannot talk to most new people. I mean, I can. But when it happens, the conversation is empty, and I am so uncomfortable I know it must show on my face. I just have nothing to say to most people I don’t know, unless they happen to share one of my nerdy obsessions, and then we have an in. But most people are not nerds, unfortunately, so this doesn’t happen often in my everyday life. And my complete awkwardness and inability to connect is then interpreted variously. I’m assuming quite a lot of people have used the word “bitch” to describe me . . . which, if you know me at all, that is like the most hilarious thing you could ever call me. My awkward, stony-faced silences don’t give most people any clue as to what’s going on up in there.So when I read about you and all the horrible, awkward, things you say to people (when you bother to say anything at all), I just can’t help but see your side of it. (Why do people like dancing? Why?) A part of me inside reaches out to you, like, I get you, dude. Even though I know that you’re also a jerk there at the beginning, assuming you’re better than everyone, because you were never taught to be kind instead of proud. But a lot of what everyone perceives as snobbery is just you feeling hella uncomfortable, you beautiful awkward man. But once people are in with you, they are in.Actually, no matter how strongly I feel about you, it’s probably good that you have Elizabeth. She’ll call you on your shit, make you a better person. We would just end up reinforcing each other’s terrible behavior.Oh my god, though, wouldn’t it be a glorious trainwreck.Love,Ashley—> Jane Eyre—> Sense and SensibilityMarch 2016: Love love love.

Synopsis:
 Mr. Darcy, a socially awkward human being, tries to seduce Elizabeth Bennet with his awkwardness and fails miserably. Hate-flirting ensues, while in the meantime the Bingley sisters are plotting to socially kill their archnemesis because they have been successfully seduced by Darcy’s awkwardness. 
Biblio-Babble:
PLEASE DON’T KILL ME: I feel like I’ve let the entire world down by not liking one of, if not the most, famous romance novel of all time. I truly do. Jane Austen is probably shaking her head up in heaven because I failed to love her book everybody seems to love. I feel the fire of a thousand souls boring into my back, searing my cold heart because I failed to be seduced by Darcy’s awkwardness. Thank God none of you know where I live so I don’t have to open the front door and a mass sea of angry readers holding pitchforks. But we can agree to disagree, right. Right????Bronte vs. Austen: Before I even read Pride and Prejudice, I noticed a pattern with classic romance readers, and that is the war between the Bronte sisters and Austen. Those who loved Austen couldn’t stand the Brontes, and those who loved the Brontes couldn’t stand Austen. Hell, even the Bronte sisters themselves couldn’t stand Austen’s writing (and that’s a fact!) A conversation with a couple of friends confirmed my sneaking suspicions. And I’m sad to say that I might be headed toward the Bronte camp. Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights are two of my favorite novels of all time. I just love the spirit, atmosphere, and writing of the Bronte sisters. The wildness and desolateness of it all. Austen is more of neat little package where everything is just practically perfect in every way with their nice little tea parties and their nice little dresses going to nice little dances and meeting nice little… you get my point. In Austen’s case, I found everything to be a little bit too neat and tidy. I like my Bronte wildness and Gothic nature. Good Beginnings: Well, now that I just spent two points basically bashing this book, let’s start with the good portions of this book. The beginning of this book was actually quite good, and I enjoyed it immensely. Getting introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, the Bennett sisters, and learning of their initial situation, there was a glimmer of hope for me there that everything would be OK. The introduction of Fitzwilliam Darcy? Fantastic. Couldn’t have been better. I was prepping my bags to board the ship of Lizzie and Darcy. It was gonna be beautiful people.You’re Doing Amazing, Sweetie: Before Kris Kardashian, there was Mrs. Bennet. Forever scheming to get her daughters into the social spotlight and find the perfect husband for them. Nothing will stand in their way. She’s getting those girls married and making a buck off of it if it’s the last thing does. I’m pretty sure that if reality TV were invented back then, she’s want a reality show of herself so they could be famous. I’ve never been alternately more entertained or horrified by a character than Mrs. Bennet. I mean, this is the woman who llet her daughter almost be chilled to death so she could see her intended, and then delighted in the fact that her daughter got so sick that she had to stay over.
Mrs. Bennett:
 Oh, such a lovely day outside! Why don’t you go see that nice Mr. Bingley of yours?
Jane:
 Mom, it’s like -2 degrees outside and pouring down rain. There’s no way in hell-
Mrs. Bennett:
 It’s raining, you say? No, no Janie. That’s great! Then you could get sick and have to stay over.Jane: You can’t be serious Mom, can you? I’m not—
Mrs. Bennett
 OH MY NERVES! MY POOOR NERVES! ALL MY DAUGHTERS HATE ME AND WON’T LISTEN TO ME! MY NERVES! MY NERVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jane:
 FINE, FINE. I’ll go, sheesh. But if I get sick, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
:One Day Later:

Messenger from the Bingley’s:
 Um, m’am, your daughter is deathly ill-Lizzie: SEE?! SEE WHAT YOU DID?! JANE IS PRACTICALLY DYING CAUSE YOU SENT HER INTO THE FUCKING RAIN!! 
Mrs. Bennett:
That was precisely the plan, dear.
Messenger from the Bingley’s:
She should probably stay for about a week or so to recover.
Mrs. Bennett:
 Even better!! Go over there and see how she’s doing, Lizzie. Tell her she’s doing amazing, and don’t forget to flirt a little, wink a little….
Lizzie:
 MOM!!!I’m An Awkward Turtle: Honestly, I thought I was really not going to not like Darcy at first. But I actually kind of dug him? He’ll never replace Mr. Rochester (sorry, people), but he was just a precious cinnamon roll who would clearly rather not be in social situations rarely, if ever. You just want to cuddle him and protect him from everything, but particularly the Bingley sisters. He does have an immense amount of pride, but I attributed it to his aloofness in general rather than him trying to be a douchbag. Those Two…: And by those two, I mean those stupid entities that were known as the Bingley sisters. Good Lord, they took up so much unnecessary space. The younger sister whose name I can’t even remember wasn’t that bad, but Caroline was like having to watch that girl you know the Bachelor shouldn’t be with but somehow manages to get the rose every single damn time. Like, why? She’s crazy and scheming and everybody knows it. Except in this case, Mr. Darcy manages to recognize what a hell of a gold digger she is and manages to conveniently ignore her at all costs. You Threw Off My Groove: I can pinpoint the exact area where the book started to fall apart for me. And it was when Mr. Collins entered the picture. It seemed like when his smug ass self trotted into Longbourn, the Mr. Darcy and Lizzie flirthation ceased to stop. He seriously threw off my groove, let me tell you. And it’s not because of how unbearably pretentious he was. Nah, it was because he managed to take all the attention away from Darcy and to himself.Come Back!: The main catalyst that made this book so goshdarn tedious was that Bingley and Darcy decide to take a vacation (convenient) to the city of London and therefore, the plotline switches to Jane and her ill-fated courtship with Bingley. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO READ ABOUT. I WANT DARCY AND ELIZABETH HATE-FLIRTING WITH EACH OTHER, NOT JANE WHINING ABOUT HOW BITCHY THE BINGLEY SISTERS ARE. The unnecessary drama of ‘Is he interested in me?” and “ Is he going to write back?” and “Ph shit, they really hate me, don’t they?” really, REALLY got on my nerves. Better Then Benadryl: For those of you who don’t know, Benadryl is an allergy medication that unfortunately does nothing for my allergies but does wonders for me as a sleeping pill. But I found something better then Benadryl and it was this book. Because towards the half-way point after Darcy decided to bail out on me, the book became tortuously boring. It was so tedious and full of unnecessary drama that I wasn’t even interested in weighed the book down for me. Even Darcy coming back and him and Lizzie finally turning their flirthation to an actual relationship failed to compensate for how many times I nodded off during the course of this book. ***********************Well, that was a longass review. I hope I still have friends after this! A promising start in what looks like a battle of the wits and minds between two very strong-minded individuals turns out to be nothing more than a snoozefest. With plotlines and drama that took away from the most famous love story of all time, I am sad to say that I did not enjoy the most famous romance novel of all time, and fear I will be jumping on board the Bronte train sooner rather than later. If this book had just focused on Lizzie and Darcy’s romance and not on Jane and Bingley and his God-awful sisters, this book would have been a winner.P.S.: Even though I didn’t like the book, I did very much enjoy the 2005 movie version of it with Keira Knightly. In fact, I watched in England while was in a trip. Talk about authentic!! ",en
826,84979,2194907166,it was amazing,"At first this book sounded frivolous to me --girls with a high school mentality trying to arrange the social scene to bring about contact with guys; mothers right there with them.Then I remembered: Owe = Ought!Although I had an undergraduate minor in philosophy, the first I heard of any such thing (at least so that I remember it) was upon reading Niall Ferguson's The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World. He said that in The Merchant of Venice, when Shylock calls Antonio ""a good man,"" he means, not his virtue, but his creditworthiness. And that--the conjoining of goodness with creditworthiness--was visible later in The Ascent in the institutionalized racism of red-lining in the 1940s, whereby African-Americans were deemed ""uncreditworthy"" (in Chapter Six), and, again, near the end of the book, where the author uses a dollar amount to express what a person would have been ""worth,"" had he pursued a certain investment strategy.Shakespeare comes far before the industrial revolution and the institution of the market economy. But the connection of ""owe"" and ""ought"" far precedes Shakespeare and even money, as I read in Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory, originating at the dawn of western civilization in Homeric literature and based on what members of a family, tribe, or culture owe to each other and to their society, as dictated by their social roles and regulations.Now I became able to take in what I was reading in Pride and Prejudice in a new light. Such an intricate social system, so carefully regulated by those ensconced in it.It's a good thing I'm reading it now! Saw some of the movies but if I've read it before it was too soon to count. My reaction would have been much as it was to Tess of the D'Urbervilles: How silly! How unfair!Another book that has influenced me recently is Farewell, Babylon: Coming of Age in Jewish Baghdad; in that traditional society the mildest slip-up, even passing a love-note to the wrong person, could render a woman disgraced and completely unmarriageable and consign her to a life of prostitution. Who would have thought that escape valve that makes those traditional societies work is the red-light district? Our current state of gender equality such as it is exists in a recent, thin sliver of time!Back to After Virtue: Alasdair MacIntyre says that at the time Jane Austen was writing, we were well on our way to our modern state of moral chaos and incoherence (as he sees it). In Austen's time, the virtues played out largely with regard to the institution of marriage -- how marriages were to be arranged and lived. Moreover, he also sees the fact of Jane Austen's being a Christian as crucial. He cites other references, such as C. S. Lewis in support of that latter point.The first of three relevant virtues enumerated by MacIntyre in connection with Jane Austen's fictional world is amiability, which he distinguishes from mere agreeableness in involving genuine affection and caring for its object. Something like sincerity, or genuineness is implied, whereas in modernity (much distrusted and disparaged in MacIntyre's scheme), the appearance of being something is as good as the actuality.Sure enough, ""amiability"" is a much-praised virtue in Pride and Prejudice. Related to amiability by way of the emphasis on genuineness is the virtue of self-knowledge, which MacIntyre describes as both an intellectual and moral virtue involving something like repentance, as when Elizabeth says ""Till this moment I never knew myself."" In that sort of repentance she had almost become a different person secondary to the scales falling from her eyes and could scarcely recognize her former reactions as her own. No longer would she be able to practice the former self-deception or react in the same way.The third virtue, constancy, is said to be more clearly present in some of Austen's other novels. Constancy, aided by the Christian virtue of patience, per MacIntyre, is the virtue of carrying out at later points promises and obligations made earlier and thus weaving a life into a unity.Are the virtues Alasdair MacIntyre attributes to Jane Austen's characters specific to Christianity? Or has he ascribed them to his choice of religion? I'd say the latter, since for MacIntyre the various moral systems, including Christianity, each make the claim of being the one true way, yet these virtues -- assuming they are characteristic of Christianity -- aren't exclusive to Christianity.The paperback I had was one of a set my mother got for my uncle late in his life at his request. I unexpectedly found taped in the back of Pride and Prejudice an 8 x 11 sheet covered front and back by his handwritten comments or review. As he aged his handwriting became increasingly tinier and more crabbed. I used to work with doctors and got pretty good at deciphering terrible handwriting, and if that skill hasn't eroded in this age of typing, I may be able to transcribe it and attach it somehow. I've only read the beginning so far: that this is the best novel in the English language.I don't know about that, but it's pretty damn good! ?",en

""He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.""
Words cannot begin to describe how much I love this novel.I was a bit nervous to read it because I love the movie so much and was worried I wouldn't be a fan of the writing since it was written so long ago. Thankfully, I was wrong about this. Despite being so different from how we speak and write now, it read easily. There were times I struggled and had to re-read passages, but it wasn't often and I had expected it so it didn't bother me so much.How funny this novel was surprised me the most because it wasn't something I expected. I found myself laughing out loud at some parts and telling friends and family about the moments. The fact that Austen wrote these humorous moments so long and and that they are so relatable today blows my mind.Austen writes these characters so well and it's one of my favorite things about Pride and Prejudice. All of them have so much depth and are so perfectly flawed in their own ways - which is something I adore in characters. Everything also felt so real - the characters, their interactions, and the relationships between family, friends, and lovers seemed genuine.I can safely say this is a book I will read over and over and never be sick of it and I will also recommend it to anyone who asks.

829,84979,2114482214,really liked it,"Ok, I finally understand what all this Mr. Darcy fuss is about. I'm not generally a romance fan, due to the tendency for cliches, but this was undeniably and authentically romantic. It did, however, take me many pages to appreciate both the characters and the writing. My biggest complaint is that, after I had endured pages and pages of mind-numbingly verbose dialogue about drivel, Austen would then sometimes merely describe the sentiment of what was said during the really dramatic parts. That killed me. I needed details, dammit!In the grand scheme of things, not a lot happens in this book. In fact, I spent the first three-quarters wondering what all the fuss was about. But the last quarter erased all of my doubt. This book is frequently compared to Wuthering Heights and, although I fear I'm in the minority, I am definitely a Wuthering Heights girl. What WH lacks in romance (yes, I am well aware that Heathcliff is no Darcy, even at Darcy's worst), it makes up for in atmosphere and depth of story. P&P is light and bubbly, while WH is dark and brooding, and I never was one for bubbles.",en

832,84979,1465563842,really liked it,"11 años pueden cambiar muchas cosas.Como ya muchos saben, no leía este libro desde el 2004. En aquel entonces me pareció una joya del romance (claro que a los 14 años cualquier cosa parece una joya del romance so, you know), Mr. Darcy me parecía perfecto y Elizabeth la protagonista más inteligente que me hubiese encontrado jamás.Tras esta relectura, sin embargo, me consigo con que:a) Se me hace imposible considerar Orgullo y Prejuicio como un romance. Ahora me resulta evidente que se trata de una critica a la sociedad inglesa del siglo XIX. Todas las señales están ahí; desde el satírico desarrollo de cada uno de los personajes —del más sensato (Mr. Bennet), pasando por los intelectuales (Mary), hasta el más necio (Collins)—, hasta la profunda ridiculización de las situaciones que estos protagonizan. Sí, claro que en medio de todo eso hay una historia de amor, pero ¿qué libro no tiene una?b) Elizabeth Bennet no es más que el alter ego de Jane Austen. Lizzy confiesa, en más de una ocasión, que se dedica al estudio del carácter de todos aquellos quienes la rodean y que disfruta el reírse de los defectos de sus conocidos. Descripción fidedigna de Austen si nos fijamos en los temas de sus obras y escritos. Paralelamente a esto, debo admitir también que Elizabeth me agradó mucho menos que en nuestro primer encuentro. Su ingenio me pareció menos perspicaz, sus bromas y -jah!- prejuicios hacia los demás me parecieron excesivos, inclusive su ""amor"" por Darcy se me hizo calculado. Este, misteriosamente, comienza a aflorar cuando visita Pemberley y, de hecho, ella misma afirma luego que la riqueza del caballero influye en sus sentimientos hacía él; y que aunque estos ""no son tan tiernos como los de Jane por Bingley, ciertamente son sensatos"". c) Darcy me sigue pareciendo tan perfecto como siempre. El grosero y déspota que se ve transformado gracias al amor es un tema recurrente en las novelas rosas -y no tan rosas- modernas, sin embargo nadie ha logrado retratarlo tan magistralmente como Austen con su orgulloso Mr. Darcy. Humillar a los demás con inteligencia y elegancia no es tarea fácil, pero alguien tiene que hacerlo.
""—No hay nada como el baile, después de todo. En mi opinión, es uno de los mayores refinamientos de las sociedades cultivadas.—En efecto, sir William; y además tiene la ventaja de estar de moda entre las sociedades menos cultivadas. Todos los salvajes bailan.""
TURN DOWN FOR WHAT!
En conclusión:
 Aunque no lo disfruté tanto como lo hice por allá por el 2004 -cuando la historia de amor me cegó ante cualquier defecto-, Orgullo y Prejuicio es un clásico que no pierde fuerza. Su retrato de la sociedad -exceptuando los carruajes y algunas otras formalidades de la época- se mantiene vigente; lo avanzado de sus personajes (sobretodo la independencia de Elizabeth) y su romance siempre serán puntos de referencia. Una lectura obligada para románticos y cínicos, por igual.En 11 años pueden cambiar muchas cosas, pero el encanto que me produce esta historia no es una de ellas.",es
833,84979,1379162825,it was amazing,"I lost half my fortune to buy this book.. I saw the movie first and I fell in love with it and I knew the novel will captivate me so I decided to buy the best edition, for I sense it'll be my favourite book. and I was right :D .It's a beautiful edition, you can't deny it :3 my first Romance and the last. I don't like this genre because they picture love in a way I don't like, but this one is a whole different thing, the story take place in England (1800s), the moral in it amazed me, the characters in it were mature, those are my reasons to accept reading this genre.The main story is about Mr.Darcy and his friend Mr.Bingley, they decided to come to Netherfield, and since it was the season of ball, their first appearance* was in a public ball. everyone noticed how Mr.Darcy is arrogant that his handsomeness and 10,000/year were to be overlooked, his friend on the contrary was humble, and even though his wealth and handsomeness was less than his friend but people liked him more for he was amiable.Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet will not get along in the first meeting, though Darcy liked her a little but when his friend Bingley asked him about her he said that she was barely tolerable and to his misfortune Elizabeth heared him, but she didn't really care because she also didn't like him.---------the only scene that was better in the movies (it was not mentioned in the book)----------this novel will tell us about the months that followed the ball, Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth will change, the improvement in their personalities were amazing! I can't tell more about it without spoiling it. here my review will end :D ----One of the things I loved is how much they depended on posts, to invite someone to your house you need to send them a letter, to thank someone for his hospitality you need to write a letter, sometimes waiting makes things seems more interesting :D note: it's one of the rare books that you can enjoy the language and the story.. and at the end if you give the novel a good time to think about it you'll realize how much lessons it contain !*I loved Mr.Darcy from his first appearance, I liked his character, and how his silence and not interacting with people were mistaken with arrogance, I relate with him in this issue ",en
834,84979,1718523986,it was amazing,"?? During the high school penultime year our English literature teacher didn’t teach us  Pride and prejudice , she preferred to let us read  Frankenstein  or  Dracula , because she had set a particular program. The Austen title was still among the books to be studied to pass the year, and it didn’t attract me. I was listening one of my friends, who adored it, talking about it continually and magnifying the relationships between the characters, the dynamics of the family, the feelings of the protagonist. At the time I was a bit (read: a lot) fixed with the fantasy, so reading a book of fiction that seemed boring did not attract me so much. Moreover, I had already tried to read it once, but I had reached the end of the first chapter and I had stopped there.I don’t know how I did it, I started it, I was sucked into the pages, the story, the characters.Up to half, however, it didn’t seem like a great thing, but, then, I started to get attached to Elizabeth, Jane, the Bennetts in general (except Lydia), I became interested in the stories of the protagonists.I fell in love.Then I saw the movie.And I fell in love again.And I keep watching the movie every time with new eyes, thinking I know everything, and every time I discover something new. Sooner or later I will have to reread the book to discover the small features that make the book of Austen one of the best portraits of the English society of her time.—————??Durante il penultimo anno di liceo la professoressa di letteratura inglese non ci ha insegnato Orgoglio e pregiudizio , ha preferito farci leggere Frankenstein  o Dracula, perché aveva impostato un programma particolare. Il libro della Austen era comunque tra i libri da studiare per passare l’anno, e non mi attirava. Sentivo una mia compagna, che lo adorava, parlarne continuamente e magnificare le relazioni tra i personaggi, le dinamiche della famiglia, i sentimenti della protagonista. All’epoca ero un po’ (leggere: molto) fissata con i fantasy, quindi leggere un libro di narrativa che mi sembrava noioso non mi attirava molto. Inoltre, già avevo provato a leggerlo una volta, ma ero arrivata alla fine del primo capitolo e lì mi ero fermata.Non so come io abbia fatto, l’ho iniziato, sono stata risucchiata dalle pagine, dalla storia, dai personaggi.Fino alla metà, comunque, non mi sembrava una gran cosa, ma, POI, ho iniziato ad affezionarmi ad Elizabeth, a Jane, ai Bennet in generale (tranne Lydia), mi sono interessata alle storie dei protagonisti.Mi sono innamorata.Poi ho visto il film.E mi sono ri-innamorata.E continuo a guardare il film ogni volta con occhi nuovi, pensando di sapere tutto, ed ogni volta scopro qualcosa di nuovo. Prima o poi dovrò rileggere il libro per scoprire quelle piccole caratteristiche che fanno del libro della Austen uno dei migliori ritratti della società inglese del suo tempo.",en

Il finale prevedibile ma così ricco di sentimento dona al tutto un romanticismo smisurato, lo stesso ardore che infiamma il cuore dei suoi protagonisti. Mr Darcy così taciturno e affascinante s'insinua lentamente nel cuore della bella ed impertinente Elizabeth scatenando un scenario di sensazioni nuove per entrambi che li porterà all'unione finale.Tra tutti i personaggi ho adorato Mr Bennet, con la sua acutezza d'ingegno e la libera ironia che non risparmia proprio nessuno, neanche la sua adorata Lizzy.",it
836,84979,482260764,really liked it,"So when I was in school taking a mock-exam for Eng.Lit. I came across some questions about a passage from a Jane Austen novel. This was ""unseen"" i.e. had not been taught in class and I certainly hadn't read any Austen outside class. There was the option of writing an essay about something else - I have forgotten what but the questions looked easier. How wrong can one be? By the time I got to ""What else did you find funny about this passage?"" I knew I was in trouble, having found nothing at all funny about it...The exam was a disaster and I learned to take my teacher's advice and do the essay regardless of what the alternative was when it came to the real exam several months later. I ended up with a B grade. Luckily my blushes were saved by an A in Eng.Lang...But my mock-exam trauma had an astonishingly long-lasting effect; I had a horror of Austen that lasted until I finally managed to break through it and give the poor lass a fair chance as an adult this year...and guess what? It's funny! More precisely, it's witty and ironical - also dramatic and fantastical...the latter in the sense of it being something of a female wishful-fulfillment fantasy for Regency British ladies of no great family. But that is only repeating Austen's widely dispersed reputation.Initially the wit struck me, later I was set for an amusing but dramatically dull story - proved false by a wholly unexpected event - and yes, somehow I managed to remain ignorant of the detail of the plot through my entire life. Even then, I was not entirely won over, although I was keen to discover how everything played out and the inevitable conclusion was arrived at.I was finally won over completely quite late on when our heroine stands up to Lady de Bourgh. So much so that I was thinking along the lines of, GO! Lizzy Bennet!, during that scene. From thinking, OK, I can see why people like it but do I really want to read another Austen after this? I went to expecting to work my way through all the Austen novels in due time.Of course this means that I'm going to have to take a look at the Brontes and maybe even give George Eliot a second chance, too...I'm already tackling some Dickens. It looks like my school nightmares may have worn off completely...only took two and a half decades.",en

840,84979,1972172832,really liked it,"I finally sat down and read a Jane Austen book. This book is also my summer assignment and I will be quizzed on it when I get back from summer vacation. With that, I took a LONG time to read this book in order to absorb everything about the plot, characters, writing, and themes. Well, this seemed to pay off in the long run. I REALLY enjoyed ""Pride and Prejudice."" The story of the Bennet family and their journey through getting their daughters to fall in love and marry the men of their dreams is both an ABSOLUTE classic story and a really well crafted story, too. I really liked how everything fell into place in the end and how everyone got up with someone, both for good and for bad. The characters were EXCELLENT. They were easily my favorite part of this book. Elizabeth Bennet is a brilliant protagonist who I was instantly loving. The development the characters had in this book, especially Darcy, is beyond great. This book is known for its characters for a reason. Also, the writing CAN be great. Trust people when they say it is witty. It truly is. The writing style of Jane Austen is very sarcastic and humorous but it is also not afraid to be serious and meaningful when it needs to be. The way it handles this aristocratic style of living is great. However, even though I do REALLY like this book overall, I do have a couple of issues with it. A lot of them are nitpicks, but there is one that made me really struggle with the book at first. Strange enough, it is the beginning.I did not like how Jane Austen started this book AT ALL. The first 50 pages took me a LONG time to get through. It starts off with barely any ground and when the book really picks up, it needs to play catch up. I feel like Jane Austen was not so grand with the beginning and it made me really confused on why people love this book from reading these first 50 pages. However, once I got to know the characters, I was able to really dig this book. So, I thought ""Pride and Prejudice"" was great. I know, I am a guy who really liked ""Pride and Prejudice,"" the CLASSIC romance novel. Well, people call this a classic for a reason and it does surprisingly hold up over 200 years later. For being written in the early 1800's, it has aged extremely well. I have seen novels from 10 years ago (*COUGH* 13 Reasons Why *COUGH*) age MUCH worse than this book did in over 200 years. In short, I did REALLY like this book. If you haven't read it, what are you doing? Go read it! It is a REALLY good book!I am giving this one a 4 out of 5 stars. ",en
841,84979,2382564273,really liked it,"Un clásico que merece la pena leer. Al contrario de lo que la gente suele pensar, no va de amor como tal, sino de madurar como personas, sobre todo aprendiendo a superar las primeras impresiones a la hora de juzgar en lugar de creernos que lo sabemos todo y dar cosas por supuestas; lo único es que lo anterior se da a través de una historia de amor. Sin contar que es una novela intimista y costumbrista que retrata muy bien la vida de la nobleza rural de la Inglaterra georgiana, permitiéndose hacer críticas y emplear el humor para ridiculizar lo que no le parece bien, y centrándose especialmente en la vida de la mujer.Si le bajo una estrella es porque Austen peca de ser muy explicativa y contar en lugar de mostrar en bastantes ocasiones.",es
842,84979,425890481,it was amazing,"It's too bad that this story is often spun as a sappy romance. This is exemplified in the Keira Knightly film with it's discordant gothic ending.Jane Austen has far more depth than that. She was an astute observer of human nature and in this novel depicts the very real predicament women were in during her era. Due to the law of primogeniture, only a senior male, usually a son, could inherit a family estate. Thus the rather practical concern by Mrs. Bennett, who has no sons, to marry off her daughters.In addition, there were few options for single women. There were no professions a woman could go into and develop an independent income. Even being a governess was a form of dependency. If a daughter remained unmarried, it was her obligation to care for her elderly parents.This, for example, is what the Charlotte character is about. Austen gives us enough exposure to Charlotte's parents to show the reader that, while they were not impossible, they would be a handful to care for as they aged. Lizzy is astounded that her friend, Charlotte, has married the loathsome Mr. Collins. But Charlotte is actually being quite practical. It's a lesser evil for her than managing her parents, especially as Mr. Collins spends most of his time in the garden.Lizzy's assessment of her father...""Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.""These are just a sample of what is going on in Austen novels below the romantic elements.",en
843,84979,1230383513,it was amazing,"Okay, I know what you're thinking. ""Pride and Prejudice"" seems like something your mom's book club reads in between ""erotic thrillers"" to give them some shred of literary cred when their friends ask what they're reading. And yes, I'm partially re-reading this because the publishing house where I work is reissuing it. But ""Pride & Prejudice"" also happens to be one of the best rom-coms in history. One of my lazier friends at Dartmouth refused to read it freshman year, claiming it ""reinforced the myth that marriage is the only thing women can aspire to."" (Yes, she ended sentences in prepositions, and no, we're not friends anymore.) This, of course, completely ignores historical context; just because something is old doesn't mean it doesn't have something to say. Turning down a marriage proposal from some dullard seems routine in 2015 but it was revolutionary in 1813. The other thing Bennet haters miss out on is Austen's subtle but biting sense of humor. You can almost feel Elizabeth rolling her eyes as she's told what is expected of women in this world courtesy of O.G. Plastics queen bee Miss Bingley: ""A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.""The level of internalized misogyny in that sentence is physically painful, and it would be easy to dismiss this sort of thinking as antiquated (because it is). For one thing, that was the world in which Elizabeth (and Austen) lived. For another: that kind of thinking still exists. We just replace those parlor tricks with a different set of obnoxious, less attainable benchmarks: A woman must be thin and in possession of perfect hair, no cellulite, and a high, tight ass; and besides all this, she needs to be sexy but not too slutty, ambitious but not too pushy, and strong but not ""bitchy,"" or the word will be but half-deserved.  Sure, we have more choices now, but far too often we still face judgment from men (and women) based on how bangable we are, proving we're not all that far from Netherfield Park no matter how many Jezebel thinkpieces we up-vote. We can look down on the women of Austen's world, or we can thank them for enduring even more ridiculous restraints than we have. Elizabeth Bennet spoke up and fought for the life and love she wanted. It may not look like the kind of Girl Power we've come to know in a post-SpiceWorld, but in light of her 19th century English background, Elizabeth Bennet was a badass. We millennials have been blessed with a wealth of feminist heroes (Taylor Swift, Alicia Florrick, Abbi and Ilana), but Elizabeth Bennet had only her intellect, her instinct and a headstrong insistence on taking charge of her life and being happy on her own terms. And if she could pull it off in the 1800s, there's hope for us all - not just to find a great husband (which is no guarantee of happiness, stability or financial solvency), but also to find ourselves.",en

845,84979,731290,it was amazing,"Pride and Prejudice is special for many reasons; for one, its style and language – albeit sometimes difficult – are delightful beyond comparison. Old texts are often dry and hard to read, which is discouraging to readers. I truly loved the way some words are used, and wished language would still be dealt with the same way. I wonder; is it really the language of the age, or a superior skill Jane Austen possessed?The way culture is portrayed is also very interesting; it is too different than any I have observed, but – I feel – closer to our culture than the western culture. The way it works is so annoying at times, but at others it is just perfect.Character development is superior in this novel; the author knew how to build our hatred towards some characters. Lydia I learned to truly despise as time went on, just as others would; her mother I never liked anymore than herself, and felt pity for those who had to tolerate her before the novel started and after its conclusion.Mr. Darcy I hated at first; just like others did, I prejudiced him! I shared Lizzy's feelings toward him in almost all parts of the story (Not that I loved him the same way she did, you get my point!), how better-done can the story be? Elizabeth Bennet; charming! I will not enumerate every character in the novel and mention how I felt about them, but what I mean to convey is: I felt like I got into the novel, and I love it.Is it perfect though? Not really; not for me at least. I would have hoped for a novel that contained less difficult expressions, just so that I can get more out of it.

846,84979,285983219,it was amazing,"Orgullo y prejuicio es una verdadera obra de arte hecha palabras. No puedo expresar bien todo lo que me ha hecho sentir Jane Austen mientras leía su historia. El argumento, observándolo por encima, puede decirse que es simple y que no tiene nada de especial. Pero la forma de estar contado todo, el ingenio y el virtuosismo que desprenden las palabras de Austen, y la forma de reflejar, y a su manera, de sacar los colores a muchos hombres y mujeres de su tiempo es inigualable. La trama no es necesariamente lo más importante, sino lo que se puede leer entre líneas. Como he dicho al comenzar esta reseña, hacia el final, te das cuenta de que la protagonista y tú mismo habéis caído en la trampa de las primeras impresiones -como se dice que Austen llamó a esta novela en un principio- a la hora de conocer a una persona, y nos da una lección. Cuando iba por la mitad, me entraron unas ganas irremediables de leer todo lo que ha escrito esta mujer y espero remediar esto pronto. En cuanto terminé la novela estaba deseando ver la adaptación cinematográfica y así lo hice.

847,84979,268790570,did not like it,"This book has been billed as one of the greatest love stories in all of literature. I have no idea why. When the story begins, Elizabeth Bennett is smart, independent, and not overly concerned with bagging a husband, which, by the standards of Victorian England, makes her a feminist trailblazer. Then she meets Mr. Darcy, who acts like an insufferable prick (this in a society obsessed with grace and good manners), and Elizabeth has the good sense to identify Mr. Darcy as the insufferable prick he is. And so she spends the first part of the book rightly loathing this asshole. Fast forward: by chance, Elizabeth finds herself touring Darcy's palatial estate, meeting his hundreds of servants, using his solid gold bidet, and suddenly she starts thinking that maybe Mr. Darcy isn't such an asshole after all. The moral of the story seems to be that enough money can make even the most abrasive and obnoxious jerk seem like prince charming. And what's really frustrating is when you realize that it's 200 years later, and while the world has changed immensely, the people are still the same. Go society! So if you want to read a real love story, read Anna Karenina. If you want to read the biggest piece of anti-feminist drivel in the literary canon, then by all means, read Pride and Prejudice.",en

[November 22, 2017] Marking for reread. I'm super behind this year on my reading goal, but I have managed to reread the three classics I strive to consume each year: Jane Eyre, Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice. This time around, Lydia's story really jumped out to me and how unrepentant she was to the very end. I caught a cold a couple weeks prior to reading this, which of course means that I watched both the Keira Kneightly adaptation as well as the BBC mini-series. It struck me how those two adaptations went about portraying the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. The 2005 version took pains to show more connections between the characters, whether that was Jane and Lizzie's sisterly affection or tenderness between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. The book, however, I think is pretty straight forward about how Mr. Bennett feels for his wife. His heartfelt warning to Lizzie about not having her unable to respect her partner in life stood out to me this time around as well. I love this story so darn much and there isn't really a time in my life when I'm not in the mood for it. I could pick it up tomorrow and read it all over again. There are worse things to be total trash for, I guess. [April 9, 2016] - Marking for reread. I read this a heck of a lot quicker than I intended to, but the story just flew by. There are books that I reread that lend themselves to continued observations and new interpretations. This book is just so familiar. I said that last time I reread it to, but that feeling is so pervasive as I read these scenes and lines that are nearly memorized. I love this story. I'm not sure if I would've loved it had I picked it up as an adult, but this is a story that has grown up with me. I'm always in awe of how funny Austen is, and Lizzy by extension. There isn't a subject or character mentioned that we don't get some witty or tongue-in-cheek statement about and I love it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to watch all the adaptations. [November 1, 2013] - Considering how many times I've read this, I shouldn't be surprised by how familiar it is, but that was the feeling I was overwhelmed with this reread.

And then the scene comes where Darcy proposes and Lizzy exposes him and drags him into the next century. In one scene, Elizabeth and Darcy go from my least favorite archetype, “asshole dude is hot”, to my favorite archetype, “they're both assholes and they bicker constantly but they slowly fall in love”. Take notes, every YA book romance from here on out; I'm going to need a scene where the girl drags the guy. From that point on, I was completely engaged. Lizzy and Darcy are my favorite couple archetype, and they were done SO WELL. I understood why they fell in love. I loved how their characters paralleled each other in flaws. I LOVED their banter. I loved how he realized his flaws and fixed them, not for her but because he wanted to be a better person. Again, take notes, YA book writers.

860,84979,1493901127,it was amazing,"For several reasons, I wanted to try an annotated version for my most recent P&P re-read. There are a few out there, but I've heard such good things about David Shapard's annotated versions that I wanted to see for myself. Two of my reasons for the reading was to a. enjoy yet another read through of P&P, but b. I wanted to get as much background information I could on the story and the historical time it was set in. And did this version do it for me? Indeed, it did.The structure of the book was an introduction, then it was set up so the story was on the left and the notes on the right, and then afterward was a chronological timeline of the story, maps, and a bibliography. The notes are numbered and correspond to numbers in the text. I found it interesting that David Shapard chose the original edition instead of one of the newer ones. Now, I wonder which editions I've read in the past because there were a few times when sentences were credited to different characters or once in a while a paragraph was split or not split. And then there were the original typos that were fun to have pointed out. There were notations that caught editor errors like time frames not lining up or descriptions reflecting the fact that the story was original written fifteen years before Austen pulled it out again, updated it, and had it published. Some spots didn't get caught for an update. I would have never noticed whether people at the time ate a heavy supper, a light supper, or no supper at all, but I'll bet those who read it a couple hundred years ago did.It is a scholarly work that is flexible. Anyone can read and enjoy it. The notes were extensive and took several forms. Sometimes the notes explained and defined older, archaic words or words that have evolved to mean something different in our time. I played a little game to test my knowledge by trying to guess meanings before I read them. I was right pretty often, but I noticed that sometimes even if I got the idea sometimes there were nuances that changed my perception. Like sometimes I thought a character was being serious when they were teasing and at other times I thought they were teasing when they were serious.Another helpful part of the notes were the explanations about words or phrases that came from popular sources at the time. My perception is always that I'm reading a classic and in truth it was written as a contemporary. I knew this in theory, but it was fascinating when the notes pointed out several references that came from books or plays or current philosophies.And beyond words or cultural references were the additional delving into the characters and themes of the story. Shapard admits that some is conjecture, but he took the time to work through outside sources like Jane's own letters or information gleaned from other family sources regarding P&P so that he could speak with some authority about the facts and his conjectures. Naturally, I was most struck by what was said about Elizabeth and Darcy, but the notes enhanced my knowledge of all the supporting characters so that I could see actions and words in a potential different light.I thought the addition of illustrations and drawings along the way for things like vehicles, furnishings, clothes, and the maps went a long way to helping me sort out things that were a bit obscure in the past. Like I heard things like traveling chaise or barouche, but it was neat to see the illustrations and get an explanation for what type of travel they are good for. Like a chaise and four is good for distance travel, only has seats facing forward, and seats three. This is significant knowledge because it was how the Bennets and Colonel Forester figured out that Wickham and Lydia didn't continue their flight beyond London. They left the chaise at a posting inn and took another vehicle into London which was proof that they weren't going all the distance to Scotland. See? Something new and a fun addition to my Austen lore.I recommend it whole-heartedly to the Austen lover and of course the Austen researchers. However, for newbies, the extras may be more distraction than help since the notes pop up frequently. Not saying a newbie shouldn't pick this up, but beware that there's a potential for distraction. All in all, this was a treasure trove and one I will be delving into again and again.",en

870,84979,1681543389,really liked it,"Should love or marriage be motivated by romantic passion or moral discernment? This is a question I struggle with when I read Pride and Prejudice. This book is regarded by many readers as a romantic novel, and Darcy is usually considered as the ideal lover/husband especially in comparison with Wickham or Mr. Collins. However, unlike most romantic novels, the heroine Elizabeth Bennett does not demonstrate much romantic passion and she most harshly criticizes Lydia's passion-driven affair with Wickham; Elizabeth seems to present moral discernment as the chief if not sole motivation behind her emotion and action. Both pride and prejudice are errors in moral discernment: one is said to be proud when one sets oneself as a moral outsider and rejects to form any moral perspective on people and events (ex: Mr.Bennett, Darcy, Jane); while one is said to be prejudiced when one forms moral perspectives on people and events in the light of one's own conviction, scenario, or concern (ex: Mrs.Bennett, Elizabeth, Lady Catherine, Mr. Collins). One way to understand this book is to see it as a correction of these two kinds of errors in moral discernment in Darcy and Elizabeth, and after the errors are corrected, they get married. Another way of understanding is to regard the ending more cynically and say there are still errors in the couple's moral discernment towards other people and towards each other. I think both ways of understanding are inadequate because they both assume that love and marriage should be motivated by objective moral discernment while ignoring the fact that a virtuous man might not make an ideal lover or husband for every lady. Pride and prejudice are not just objective errors in moral judgments, but also characteristics intrinsic to different people, or in other words honest expressions of one's fundamental values. I think Elizabeth's self-righteous over-moralizing, or Darcy's emotional obtuseness, or Mr. Bennett's hypocritical composure, or Jane's passivity are individualistic characteristics that make them who they are. It is impossible to say whether those characteristics are right or wrong, good or bad. Even Mrs. Bennett, Lydia, Wickham, Mr. Collins might be good wives or husbands for certain people; and of course the well-acknowledged Darcy, Elizabeth, Bingley, or Jane can be horrible partner. Thus I think the ending of Pride and Prejudice is very open, and Jane Austen doesn't mean to demystify her characters for the readers even though it might seem she has already done that.",en

""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""
It is also a truth universally acknowledged that this is one of the most quoted quotes of all time. Oh the English language!This novel follows Elizabeth Bennet, her family, Mr Darcy, Darcy's friend Bingley, and how love eludes them due to social status, jealous family members, an opportunist soldier, and an arrogant and uptight aunt.Anyways, top reasons to read Pride and Prejudice:1-The witty dialogue.2-The characters being smart asses and having too much pride and prejudice to actually solve anything, so they end up just running around each other like headless chickens.3-The mother and father in this story are the opposite of each other, together they make the perfect comedy duo.4-Some of the most hated characters of all time, Wickham and Caroline, plus Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as the stupidest of them all, William Collins.5-It speaks of education and morality quite freely, even thought it was written at such an age.6-It depicts the role of wealth and class very accurately.7-A woman makes the decision of who she wants to end up with no matter how pressured she is by her mother.8-The main characters go through a well developed character arc, hence they mature throughout the novel.9-It is perhaps the best ""happily-ever-after"" novel ever published.10-There is also a runaway that causes everyone to have to adapt to it, stopping my OTP here to be together sooner.
“Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
I hope those were enough, I wanted to keep adding but I did not want to make this review be a list. Now, what is the best part of this novel? The bloody characters that are so magnificent that one can only love them. 
Elizabeth
 is a prideful person. Ha! I got you there, see it is often thought that 
Darcy
 is the prideful one, because of who he is an acts, however, Elizabeth has pride in herself, she deems herself to be better than Darcy because she does not believe others to be inferior, therefore contradiction herself. Darcy is a prejudiced man, at the beginning at least. His character arc is him trying to overcome this view as he falls in love with someone of lower disposition than himself. The reminder of the Bennet family are a bunch of crazy lunatics! 
Lydia and Kitty
 are out of control, I despise them. 
Mary
 is the most boring person, in fact she would have been perfect to marry cousin 
Collins
.
 Jane
 was too pure for this world, I felt so sad, she is so shy and keeps her emotions hidden too well. 
Mr Bennet
 is an old man that has most ironic sense of humour ever, what a treasure. 
Mrs Bennet
 is the smartest member of this family. Know why? Because she knows as soon as old Mr Bennet dies, her daughters will have no one that will want to marry them in a society that saw women the way they did, so she goes through great pains trying to get them all to wed before it is too late, she sort of succeeds, although not really.
 Bingley
 is too good natured, and falls for Jane but is unable to decipher her, and falls into the control of others, very disappointed in him. 
Wickham
 made me want to vomit, maybe because I already wanted Lizzie and Darcy together and then there he went getting involved and saying things I disagreed with, luckily his ending was the doom he deserved. And lastly 
Charlotte
, this poor girl sees herself as a burden to her parents, and as such decides to marry for financial stability instead of love. She is the voice of man women at the time, and is never condemn for this by Austen, which I was very glad for.
“He is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter. So far we are equal.”
Much like Jane Eyre this novel deals with wealth and class of the time, using it as a very strong plot device that works brilliantly. Bingley and Darcy are extremely wealthy men of the upper class, Jane and Elizabeth are ""gentlemen's daughters"" but whose father is way below the pay rate of both these men, as well as they have an uncle that is a businessman that is not of similar stature to them either, hence class and money is an obvious divide for these two young couples. Bingley however does not care for this at all, he sees the good in people rather than getting a feel of their character via their social background, Darcy is the complete opposite. He views standing in society as a priority, and there is a scene in which he is speaking to Elizabeth about something that I will not spoil, and he lists how unworthy she is meant to be because of her family, but sort of kinder than how I put it, but still extremely cruel.Knowledge is the other big theme, and one I am rather fond of. Lizzie is a very educated woman despite never having a governess, but rather because she sought to better herself, despite the restrictions put upon her sex. Darcy is obviously well educated, and has very high standard on what he wants for a wife, a partner as equal as him, so as to not belittle himself. This is the basis of their relationship, through their beginning hatred, they have discussions and conversations that lead to them seeing each other as compatible partners. They respect each other, and that is the main glue of their relationship.So if you want a book about people that had nothing better to do than gossiping, horrid dating, an upper class setting, characters that make stupid decisions but then solve them, an entitled old lady that comes to rain on everyone's parade, a self-absorbed and stupid cousin that is the epitome of butt kissing, and a hilarious married duo, this book is for you.How can someone not love Darcy:
“I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”

881,84979,380422722,really liked it,"So much time has passed since I first read the book, that coming back to Jane Austen after 30 years feels like exploring virgin territory. Pun intended, as the book deals with five unattached Bennet girls, and the opening gambit is one of the best starts ever to a comedy of manners: It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. I didn't care much for the first reading, back in the 70's, probably due to a poor Romanian translation and to my gloomier preferences at the time for Thomas Hardy, Balzac, Flaubert or Galsworthy. I thought this was fluff, and I would like to thank my GR friends who pimped the book recently and gave me the push to try again, as I found the ride a lot more entertaining and worthy of appreciation. There's nothing much to be said about the plot, it has been analyzed and dissected in hundreds of literary essays and studies. I would only point out its enduring quality that made it probably the most imitated script in Romantic comedy: boy meets girl, they take instant dislike to each other, yet the story keeps throwing them together. Many misunderstandings and spirited verbal fights follow, until boy (or girl) totally embarasses self and declares his / her true passion. Of course, it helps if one of the parties is stinkingly rich. That's about every Rom Com to come out of a Hollywood or Bollywood studio, and I got a feeling it started here, at Longbourn and Pemberley. And in these cases, it's usually better to read the original material.Most of all I loved the intricate phrasing, the sly humour and the sheer exuberance of Elizabeth Bennet, her curiosity, her steadfast fidelity to her friends, her strength in recognizing mistakes made and willingness to make amends. I found her sisters a little bland, especially Jane, and the talent of the author truly shines for me in the most wickedly humorous passages dealing with Mr. Collins pomposity, Mrs. Bennet's shrill exclamations or Lady Catherinne de Bourgh's lofty pronouncements. I would go so far as to link Jane Austen to my other recent English fad - P. G. Wodehouse. They share not only a refreshing sense of humor, but also a certain artificial flavor of the world their characters evolve in. I have the feeling this is more like a photoshopped version of Reality, with the crinkles and the hairy moles smoothed over, with a rosy layer of carelessness added and the happy-go-lucky attitude of a class that never had to really worry about where the next meal will come from.The missing star in my review comes from this very absence of a world outside the class conscientious ""landed gentry"" decribed by Austen. It feels like the British tiered society was even more exclusive at the time than the Indian caste system, with personal servant barely earning a passing mention and field laborers missing entirely from the landscape.One more observation I want to make is about the fact that the novel was written as a contemporary episode, while we are reading it as a historical document. This was evident for me when, comparing Jane Austen to Georgette Heyer, I noticed that Austen almost never includes descriptions of dresses, bonnets, type of carriages or food courses or architectural styles, while Heyer goes into painstakingly researched descriptions of the same things. To Austen and her initial readers, these details were unnecessary, as it is for us today to describe what a MacDonald hamburger is made of (as if anybody knows that) or what the difference between a sedan and an all-terrain car is.I would like to end my impressions by coming to the defense of Mr. Bennett, who I see is receiving a lot of flak for being an inappropriate father figure. I feel his pain of being cooped in with a screeching wife and FIVE spirited daughters, and I loved his coping mechanism of sarcastic jokes and taking refuge in the library. I would also like to point out, that despite his jokes, he does go and introduces himself to the prospective suitors, he also stands up to his wife in the matter of Lizzy'y bethrotsal to Mr. Collins, and he also goes immediately to London to try to solve Lydia's woes. I don't believe his role should have been one of strict authocratic ruler, and I also believe his wife and youngest daughter would have got into trouble with or without his intervention, anyway. I prefer to think that the good character of Jane and Elizabeth owes more to his love of knowledge and amiable disposition than to his materialist oriented consort.I feel ready after the lecture, to try some of the recent movie adaptations, either the Keira Knightley one or the BBC series.",en

884,84979,2374482173,really liked it,"4 Stars.I don't usually do romance so reading Pride and Prejudice didn't feel like the best of ideas but I mean, I had to read at least one Jane Austen book right? Despite this, it was amazing and I couldn't be more surprised by me liking it.This is the first classic that I have read where I have felt the characters to be so real. Elizabeth's character was probably my favourite, her personality just makes me smile. The family relationships also felt real, specifically between Elizabeth and Jane. I love those two.One reason I don't enjoy romance novels, is because a lot of things in YA are so instant. Literally, some characters do as little as glance at eachother and the next thing you know is that they marry and live happily ever after but with this story, things were just more gradual which added to, yet again, the realness of the characters and their story.I also adored Jane Austen's writing. It is because of this why I am rating this book so highly. She writes elegantly whilst also including humorous undertones and everything reads so smoothly? I can't really describe it but this was such a nice change as many classics just feel heavy and rocky.The only thing I didn't like, was that the pacing slowed quite a bit towards the middle of the story but it didn't bother me too much. I had prepared myself for this to be a slow moving story anyways, so was pleasantly surprised by how the pacing had moved quite quickly for the majority of this book.I am glad to say that I now understand why Jane Austen is so immensely loved and please excuse me as I go and read everything she has ever written...",en
885,84979,274461085,it was ok,"Video review: http://youtu.be/lNyQuF647QAUnlike Jane Eyre, this did not live up to the hype. I found it kind of boring, not Hemingway boring, but just dragged out. Mr. Darcy has become such a famous character over the years and I was surprised to see how little he was in the novel! It was odd. Some criticisms:1. I found that this had too many characters for a 350 page novel. First you have to remember the names of the five sisters, then all of the Lords and Ladies from around the area, then the men of the novel, all of the houses and estates around the area, it was too much! 2. I couldn't believe any of the male characters. It's as if Austen had set out to make the most unrealistic men in fiction. Yes, I do know that this novel is very cliche, but that's because this novel invented the cliche of ""men you'd love to hate but can't"". I think this criticism is mainly because I'm reading this from a male point of view. Maybe women like those characters, I don't know, but I just couldn't believe them. I still liked this novel though. I definitely don't hate it. It's a perfectly fine book to read and enjoy. I must say I loved Mr. and Mrs. Bennet the most. They were the comic relief this novel needed! This is lots of people's favourite book (including my English teacher) and I get why that is. It's good, but not great. ",en

Five reasons to read Pride and Prejudice
1. The detail of Austen's writing which drags the reader almost into her time period. Sure it can be long and slow at times but it creates a glimpse into a previous era which was more pure and innocent in many aspects. 2. The wit of Austen's writing. An aspect many readers could easily miss if they don't delve into the beauty of the prose.3. The characters created are incredibly memorable. Who could forget Mr Darcy or Elizabeth Bennett? They are not only memorable but likeable in their own ways too.4. The background story behind Austen writing in a time when women writing was frowned upon. A story that showed self-belief and motivation despite being trodden down by society. I respect her for that alone to come out and write powerful stories like this.5. It's a novel that helps you to escape and enjoy yourself and that makes this valuable as a work of fiction. For too often people forget that books are not real and should help us escape.",en

The exhaustive romance, the passion brought to life in Elizabeth Bennet, and the remarkably crafted character of Mr. Darcy — oh, Austen, you amaze me. What I worried about classics was that though I generally liked the book, the dullness might actually become too dull for me. But Austen made sure things happened. I was entertained.I wish people to have pleasure reading this brilliant work outside of painstakingly studying the meanings and symbolism, just for the sake of school. Never would I pick up a book to enjoy just the romance, especially when it is modern. Classics make it incredibly realistic, with credible characters that own traits you would find in people of this world. Some romances involve characters that are too ""special"". They seem to must always own a strange quirk or they just stand out among everybody else. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy do stand out (of course, they are the primary characters) but not so to make them the only couple important. Things happen outside of their circle, and I feel that that is important to note. I don't think I would have enjoyed the entire book to revolve around their love, as much as I adore their chemistry.Our protagonist is absolutely lovely. Her deepest concerns and love for her sister Jane were a delight to read. By travelling on foot and in mud to see to her health, risking her image in front of the very people her mother intend to impress — it portrayed Elizabeth's priorities quite clearly without having her say so. She's the opposite of Jane. Jane saw the good in everyone and had thought ill of nobody while Eliza, despite her big heart, wasn't as sweet and readily amiable to strangers. But can I just say that her imperfection is actually an imperfection? What I mean is that some authors do understand that their female protagonists must have a flaw or two to become a realistic character but often even their flaws are linked to something good — it's more like an opportunity to tell the reader, ""See? She has problems. She's relatable. Now, love her!"" And often the girl would have a flaw that is nothing compared to her always excellent sense of good and bad. She doesn't exactly learn her flaw and develop anything out of it. Some even know they have the imperfection because, of course, they know everything about themselves. They got it all figured out what is wrong or right about them but don't even expect it to go further than that. So while they do have an imperfection, they are still perfect. It's quite tiring. But, look, Elizabeth did something I'm guilty of, myself. She judged a person too fast. A trait she prided herself on turned out to be a terrible habit. She saw the surface of a person and believed it to be the same underneath. And she came to realize it, with the most dreadful regret:
“How despicably I have acted!"" she cried; ""I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our aquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
Here, Eliza learned and repented her mistake. Here is a character that was truly unaware and flawed. That monologue struck me. It teaches a lesson to those who read, that while we think we are right to think such thoughts, we might be intolerant. Is it not pleasing to read about a protagonist that actually has problems that originated from her own self?And Mr. Darcy. I relate to him a little, too, but I think that is the point of these characters. They're so real that you cannot help connecting to them. I was always guarded with my own feelings and I hardly gave thought to what people might assume of my persona. I always felt that I did not need to explain myself or present myself as I am, because I simply did not feel the need to. Mr. Darcy suffered from his own behavior. By choosing to appear as a disagreeable man, he was known as a disagreeable man. He took advice — he actually took it — and learned. He didn't go away and come back a changed man just by time, he made an effort to be better. Both our primary characters changed, with sacrifices and mistakes on both paths, and it all ended for the better. Things could always work out if you're willing to try.I'm going to end my review here with some of the elements I liked most in Pride and Prejudice. The convincing characters, the sisterly love, the role of money in marriage (true to the time), the consequences of happiness, the self discovery and development, and the charming and teaching love story. The ending was predictable for these classics but I always appreciate them. After all the hardships of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, they deserve it, don't you think?",en

Old and dusty on my favorite Granparents shelf, and known to be my favorite Aunt's favorite book, I decided to give it a try. It would be my first Austen book I'd ever tried. And damn! Happy I did!!I was looking for something, anything akin to Downton Abbey to read, and anything I'd found of late was just too high fantasy. But this book, with the setting and characters fit the bill just perfectly. I pride myself in the fact that I held no prejudice against Darcy to begin with (heh, see what I did there), and was happy it turned out. Of all the Bennet sisters, Jane was my favorite, and Lydia my least. While the book wasn't heart pounding action, it was a thriller in my mind. It was rather intense towards the end, and I was thoroughly engaged and absorbed in the family and their trial by the last few chapters. I couldn't get enough of Mr. Darcy, no matter where in the book, and was disappointed that he didn't get more ""screen"" or should I say, ""page"" time. Though I suppose the lack of his appearance helped build the allure for me, along side Elizabeth's eventual grow in appreciation for him. If I had been there, I'd have asked Darcy for his hand the first time Lizzie rejected him. <3Lady Catherine was a bore and a bitch -- yes, I said it -- and I didn't like her OR cousin Collins. Both had their noses too high in the air, and did the family no justice by having them visit, other than to verbally rub their noses in the ground and say ""LOOK HOW FILTHY WELL OFF WE ARE!""I mean, Cathy-gal basically had her own fanfare, for God's sake. And she was well aware of it, and exploited it! Collins was basically her puppy dog, admiring and drooling over her, and I half expected the plot to turn of Collins leaving Charlotte to engage with Cath. Poor Lizzie was already trying to help with Jane's misery, and to have to aid Charlotte as well...That'd had been a good plot too....But I digress. I can't say too much more without giving the plot away, but as my first Austen read, I was impressed, and can be hereby added as a fan of her. I expect I'll have to invite my Aunt for tea, soon, to discuss Austen, as avid reader fans are wont to do. Regardless, Austen's entire library has just hit my 'to-read' list, and I will be plugging away and making the list 'read' very quickly. :)",en

""All this she must possess,"" added Darcy, ""and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading.""My expectations weren't that high going into this book, but I was blown away by the brilliant characterisation, an instructive and entertaining portrayal of society at that time and place in history, conversations full of wit, subtle humour, the tension in the letters of the letters, the masterful dissection of psychology. Of course, the hero and heroine bearing the sins of the title stood out.The MBTI personality test is something I find amusing (don't take it too seriously) because I can identify very strongly with my type (INTJ) description. There are various threads online discussing what types fictional characters would be, and there seems to be some consensus that Mr. Darcy is also an INTJ. Other fictional characters also pointed to as being this type are Rodion Raskolnikov, Hannibal Lecter, Gandalf the Grey, Professor Moriarty etc...""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"" said Darcy, ""of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often seen done.""This is one of the most famous titles in English literature, yet what took me this long to pick it up?

I took the book from the shelf to look at the cover and then found myself taking the book to my chair. I read the first page to decide once and for all, fell into the language and kept reading. Austen has such a smooth style and is masterful at keeping the reader turning the pages, even when one knows the outcome.This book could be a primer on the danger of combined parental neglect and indulgence of a favored child. (I’d say ‘warning’ instead of primer, but that type of parent is not likely to see him/herself at fault until it’s too late, if even then.) Mr. Bennett chooses to deal with a disappointing marriage sardonically and by claiming his private space. Elizabeth’s witty, spirited responses, especially those to Wickham and Lady de Bourgh, are cathartic.As I read along, even though it's been a long time since I've seen the BBC mini-series, I couldn't help but hear and see Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the main characters.

912,84979,2223889213,it was amazing,"There are a lot of reasons to read Jane Austen. I've been reading her again because I wanted to study a little closer the way she chooses when to show and when to tell. Her books, and particularly Pride and Prejudice, are masterful examples of a narrator fully confident and in control. She is telling you a story and she will freely pick when to tell you how a character feels or what a character is thinking and when to let the character's own words and actions and gestures show you. And more than that, she is free to do so with any character at any time. There is something about her narrators that reminds me of freedom in restraint, of arbitrariness with purpose, or something like that. I also like the authorial compassion that sustains even the portrayals of the ""jerks"" in her novels and in this one, the people you end up admiring start off as jerks. And the willingness to do that, to not be overly solicitous of the reader's empathy is also a kind a courage one should aspire to. The truth is that although I start off with all kind of aspirations to learn about Austen's writing process, I end up wallowing unconsciously in the delight of her long, uncomplicated sentences, in her subtle humor and barely visible irony. And what joy to find a small sexual innuendo and think that I'm the only one that's ever seen it. I read recently an article by a scholar of Austen's works who happened to be a man and who recounted that women were often bewildered by his love for Austen. He couldn't understand why this would cause surprise and even a little resentment. I agree with him. If I were a woman, I would give Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice to every man I met and their reading the books and the degree of their appreciation would be strong signifier of where we should go from there. Within the constraints of the time in which Jane Austen wrote, which included the constraint of women, Jane Austen managed to give her women characters a spirit that we mistakenly call modern. I don't think that women need to be reminded of that spirit's perennial existence as much as men do. Her books are for humans, which is to say men and women, and what they create in the reader, male or female, is an inkling of how love is born and how maintained.",en

Che libidine, signori, trascorrere le giornate a nulla fare, ritenendo invece di essere molto occupati e non sentendo la propria autostima per nulla intaccata da tale inoperosità. Come si riesce? Fatto culturale. E Mrs Bennett di cultura se ne intende. Ma anche senza giungere a tale perfezione di vacuità, senza arrivare alla perfezione della rapa, il quadro vermeeriano (non ho resistito al riferimento) della società nel periodo Regency che Jane Austen pennella è ineguagliabile. Brava la Austen ad illustrare i rapporti sociali, più di quanto lo sia a raccontare degli individui. E mi ha colpito proprio la levità dell’ambiente, della country gentry con qualche legame con il mondo dei mercanti, che riesce a non accorgersi di ciò che la circonda, che non vede le guerre napoleoniche, ma che vede nei soldati, impegnati a presidiare i porti e i luoghi cruciali di difesa contro le mire espansionistiche della Francia, solamente un vivaio di possibili pretendenti e mariti. Anche i soldati sembrano così comportarsi, mentre si pavoneggiano nelle uniformi sembrano più ballerini e intrattenitori che combattenti, di Nelson non ne ho visti in queste pagine. Nulla traspare. La rivoluzione industriale per antonomasia così inglese, sembra qui appartenere ad un altro mondo. Ciò che vediamo della classe lavoratrice si limita alla servitù che va a far provviste e intanto si preoccupa di distribuire al circondario informazioni circa i propri datori di lavoro. Lavoro duro. Bravissima la Austen a dimostrare come si possa vivere senza essere coinvolti dagli eventi storici. Dimostra come a volte non sia così difficile estraniarsi per un motivo o per un altro (una volta ho chiesto a mia madre come avesse vissuto gli anni della rivoluzione sessuale e mi ha risposto: sai, con tre figli piccoli me la sono persa (!). Altro che Porci con le ali…) e il mondo delineato in Orgoglio e Pregiudizio esercita un grande fascino. Il fruscio delle gonne durante i balli, i chiacchericci sfaccendati, le confessioni pudiche trasportano in un mondo leggero e Jane Austen è riuscita a farlo anche con me – mai stata molto romantica, né preromantica – anche dopo duecento anni.",it

But who refuses to get married. Her mother believes it is imperative and non negotiable but her father lets her spread her wings, although it doesn't stop her mother trying. It is at a local dance that Lizzy first meets Mr Darcy, a stubborn man with a stubborn face but who intrigues Lizzy. In the book we follow the life of Miss Bennett and watch how a woman of high society kicks against societal standards.Pride and Prejudice is by far one of my favourite books of all time. The writing is so beautiful and brilliantly portrays life in that time period (far better than any period drama created today could). It is a little time capsule, protecting and preserving a specific moment in history.The plot is gripping, enthralling you as you decide who you think Lizzy should or shouldn't be with. The book battles with the principle that you should never scrutinise someone under pride or prejudice. That you should always look a little harder. But that is simply what is on the surface of the book. The most fascinating thing that we can observe is the complex and intriguing social structure which the world of Austen revolves around, because she too had to suffer the effects of a hierarchy system that separated those who loved each other and meant that those young and in love did not have a choice.This book is a classic and so multi dimensional, a brilliant piece of literature.",en

I must say though that P&P was a little hard to relate to because it was written a long time ago, when women had to wear uncomfortable clothing to try and look pretty and were defined mostly based on their ability to trap a man. Back in those days, being a smart-ass was considered a huge liability for a lady, and also back in those days some otherwise clever ladies, like the main character in this book, demonstrated a weakness for snooty, self-absorbed pricks such as the dashing jerkface Mr. Darcy of this quaint novel. All in all, though, none of these strange anachronisms proved an impediment to my falling into a two-day swoon on my family's sofa, where I did nothing but munch bonbons and produce noisy, often indignant commentary on the goings on within these pages.Strangely, this is the only Jane Austen book I've ever read, maybe because I'm sure the others can't be half as great as this extremely tough act to follow.",en

The wide array of characters and their antics - Mr. Darcy’s haughtiness, Lizzy prejudices, Mr. Collins hilarious proposal, the incorrigible Mrs. Bennet with her nerves and shy Georgiana- all of them are so dear to me. Jane’s prose, the subtle wit with which she presents the society, everything is so heartwarming. Indeed, there is little I can say in her praise which has not already been mentioned in much fancier a language, using more creative expressions. I will only state with utmost sincerity that my life really feels incomplete in many ways without revisiting Elizabeth every year!",en

You spend your life avoiding it and making excuses, only to discover years later that you actually love broccoli. Pride and Prejudice is the same. It is really good, clever, and funny at times (especially when ever Mrs. Bennet opens her mouth). Even if you know the Cliff Note version of the story, the goodness is in the story telling. A very worthwhile read. Read for enjoyment and not review. ",en

926,84979,2186458740,it was amazing,"Darcy, ti presento LizzyDi Orgoglio e Pregiudizio, il più noto romanzo di Jane Austen, è stato detto di di tutto, essendo uno dei romanzi più letti al mondo e da cui sono state tratti parecchi sceneggiati e film. L'unico che ancora rimaneva a non saperne nulla ero io evidentemente, che nemmeno ne conoscevo la storia (ma dove vivo?).Che cosa mi è piaciuto di questo bel romanzone che dicono piaccia più alle femmine che ai maschi (con le 5 stelle mi colloco evidentemente tra le prime)?Innanzitutto il libro illustra perfettamente la vita agiata della classe media inglese dell'inizio ottocento, fatta di rapporti sociali basati sulle classi sociali, sulle apparenze, sulle vuote conversazioni. “Sir William Lucas, e sua figlia Maria non dissero nulla che valesse la pena di essere sentita, ed Elizabeth li ascoltò con lo stesso piacere con cui ascoltava il cigolio della carrozza.”Una vita in cui i soldi (le rendite annuali) sono importantissimi perché definiscono l'importanza della famiglia e della persona e il cui fine è l'effettuazione di un matrimonio (un contratto commerciale tra due parti la cui rendita deve essere più o meno equilibrata) all'altezza del proprio rango. L'amore nel contratto di matrimonio non è importante, è il cosiddetto ""grasso che cola"". “La felicità nel matrimonio è solo una questione di fortuna.”In questo contesto ben caratterizzato si collocano due figure fondamentali: Miss Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy, rendita A=40 sterline/anno) e Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy (rendita B=10.000 sterline/anno). Questi due personaggi emergono rispetto agli altri per varie ragioni; innanzitutto perché cambiano con le situazioni, maturano, crescono durante lo svolgimento del libro, riuscendo a superare gli atteggiamenti di pregiudizio da parte di Elisabeth e di orgoglio da parte di Darcy. Secondariamente perché sfuggono alla regola del matrimonio basato su aspetti commerciali. Basta confrontare le rendite A e B per vedere l'enorme importanza del rifiuto di Elisabeth alla proposta di matrimonio di Darcy. Terzo perché sono due personaggi decisamente positivi, intelligenti, sensibili, colti e in grado di agire senza preoccuparsi solamente del loro interesse.Credo che un discorso particolare meriti Mr. Darcy, eletto dall'immaginario femminile come uomo ideale da ricercare a tutti i costi (ovviamente senza successo). Mr. Darcy è un gentiluomo, bello, attento, sensibile, disinteressato, acuto, colto, intelligente, straricco ma senza mostrarlo, dolce, delicato, deciso, abile, riflessivo, romantico ma anche fragile. (ahimè, mi mancano più di una decina di qualità...)Considerando che il libro è scritto benissimo (Austen proprio brava), che è scorrevolissimo, che parla di sentimenti ed emozioni (che sono senza tempo) senza troppe situazioni mielose, capisco benissimo la ragione per cui il libro abbia avuto così tanto successo.In definitiva, una bellissima sorpresa, per me!",it

928,84979,474681991,it was amazing,"My list of favourite books changes daily but Pride and Prejudice has always been the one book that never leaves my heart. Although not a fan of classics, this book always manages to capture me. What I like the most is its simplicity and humor. The book is wholly based on the story between a couple and makes no pretense at being something it isn't, which is a light, easily read, romantic story. It's funny at times and generally lacks the heavy, dramatic flare of many romances. It's also quite interesting to see the society through the eyes of a woman that knew it first-hand.
“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.” 
So when a certain eligible and very agreeable bachelor......settles nearby, the women of the Bennet family......are overjoyed by the prospect of such a proper husband. This gentleman has brought with him the most disagreeable of friends and two of the most snobbish women in society though......and while Mr Bongley's easy manners make him popular the rest of the party is only highly regarded by Miss Jane Bennet who is of the sweetest desposision anyone could hope for. It isn't long before Mr Bingley and Miss Bennet form a relationship of mutual affection, something that is not tolerable to Mr Bingley's two sister and his best friend since her family and fortune are by no measure equal to his. Combined with the fact that 3 of the 5 girls, the mother and occasionally the father are silly and improper, the match is not appropriate to them. So they do their best to separate them. Meanwhile Elizabeth Bennet has become an object of admiration in the eyes of Mr Darcy despite all his arrogant disregard for her family. She however, based on the lies of Mr Wickham......and Darcy's generally disagreeable character, dislikes if not hates, the gentleman greatly. So when a proposal comes her way from him she is suitably astonished......and considering that she generally regards him as the man who destroyed her sister's happiness with Mr. Bingley, and the fact that Mr. Darcy seemed not happy at all that he couldn't deny his feelings......she has no reserve in telling him that she doesn't want him in the most eloquent of ways...
“From the very beginning— from the first moment, I may almost say— of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.” 
...Later on Lizzy is given a letter from Darcy which explains the reasons why he decided to separate Mr Bingley from Jane(which Lizzy cannot discredit much to her annoyance), and a detailed list of all his dealings with Wickham which prove that not only is Wickham a liar but that Darcy is a very generous and honorable man. Lizzy starts to feel affection for him which turns even stronger after she meets him again some months later and he seems completely changed. He is more talkative, sociable and attentive and she can't help but think that this is because of her. But just when things start to go right Lizzy's younger sister, and the silliest of all, creates a scandal by eloping with Wickham, something that brings great disgrace to the family and persuades Lizzy that she's lost any chance to a respectable marriage. But Lizzy doesn't count on the strength of the gentleman's feelings for her which lead him to save the family from ridicule by making sure that Wickham and Lydia are married......after this things progress and Bingley, after conversing with Darcy, finally asks Jane to marry him......and Darcy asks Lizzy to marry him(again)......and since the lady has long since changed her mind about him and loves him equally...
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.” 
...she accepts him and they live happily ever after...This is the summary of the best romance ever written, at least the best in my opinion. Jane Austen knew how it's done all these years ago!",en

However, I believe that this is one of the most well written novels in history and that the genius of Jane Austen’s gift for word crafting has rarely, if ever, been surpassed. The storyline, a household of four sisters on the manhunt looking for rich husbands who can secure their future, keep it in the family, and live happily ever after, was a bit of a problem for me. I read the reviews. I followed the recommendations. I ignored that fact that I was born vagina-less and took the plunge into Austenland head on. The result was a mixed bag for me. The plot simply failed to hold my interest for the long haul. Granted, this is not the longest 19th century novel I have ever read but it sure felt like it. Maybe I am just used to the juicy sensation of Wilkie Collins or M.E. Braddon… Or maybe I just got tired of the four daughters bickering about who have the best chance of marrying or if Mr. Darcy really is a pompous prig. So there you have it. Not my favorite nor was it something that I thought was poor. It’s just that maybe this book wasn’t for me. However, if every book were written like Pride and Prejudice with such beauty and art, I believe that this book would have been forgotten about long ago. ",en

2nd read:
 oh man, this story only got better after reading it a second time. Where the first time I had to look words up or check some plot-points, I now better understand the characters (like how blind Elizabeth is to her own prejudice) and their actions (like Darcy's awkwardness in the beginning!). This made the story all the richer and more amusing than before, making this a classic I would gladly re-read again next year! <3Original Review: On the 19th of april I met my new best friend. Her name is Elizabeth Bennet and she is more witty and sociable than I will ever be, and I love her for that.  As I walked into Waterstones and saw those beautiful Penguin covers, I knew I couldn't push Jane Austen's famous novel away any longer. It was time to open up this well known English classic and see for myself what the buzz is about, and after finishing it today, I can tell you that the praise for this story is well deserved. Jane Austen wrote in 1796 an universal story about proper English middle-class women who all are looking, in different ways, for a man to marry, and wrote about those old-fashioned women in such a 'modern' way that every reader can easily identify with one of them. The main character of this novel is Elizabeth Bennet, a young lady of twenty-one who lives together with four sisters, her silly and oversensitive mother and aloof father, whose lifes gets shaken up by the arrival of young and rich Mr. Bingley, sour-looking Mr. Darcy, and a well-dressed army unit of young soldiers. The first two men couldn’t be more different: where Mr. Bingley is 'Prince Charming' come alive, Fitzwilliam Darcy (I laughed so hard at his first name) is the human equivalent of an ugly, antique table piece that you want to throw away, but since it's going to pay for your old day, you're stuck with it. So yes, I really felt for Elizabeth when I read how prideful Mr. Darcy had his heart set out on her. Their rocky relationship, which of course later changes and blooms, was a nice contrast to that of Jane and Mr. Bingley, who immediately hit it off, but keep tiptoeing around each other. Oh, it would have been easier if Jane, and many other characters in this book, had read Shakespeare.  ""A heart to love, and in that heart, Courage, to make's love known."" (Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 3) But while romance and courage plays a big role in this book, it’s mostly about women and sisterhood: because when it comes down to finding the right man to marry, all the girls in this story need support from their friends and family. Whether is Jane and Elizabeth (saint Jane! Oh I adore her), Elizabeth and Charlotte (the dreamer Vs. the practical girl), or Lydia’s frustrating actions (she could have done with more healthy support!): in the end all these ladies hope to find the one, and end up getting just what, or who, they deserve. But above all the sisterly and wedding-drama, the most engaging part of this story is how slowly Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet fall in love. He learns to let go of his pride and strict mind, and she lets go of her preconceived opinions, and thanks to an important letter (Oh, that Letter!  *is still shocked*) Elizabeth gets to see Mr. Darcy for who he really is. So five stars for this Jane Austen novel, and I hope to read more of her work in the future. Already I can hear Waterstones calling my name, so expect more English-romance novels coming up soon.",en

A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “He is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter.So far we are equal.” ""I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr.Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by thenephew.He has more to give.""Yours sincerely, etc."" ",en

 I think everyone knows how this story goes, but if not, first off, what-the-heck go read this book, and second off, there will be spoilers in this review.I was always planning on reading this the moment I watched the BBC TV show, but I'd never gotten the chance to read the book, mostly because I thought that since I've rewatched the show millions of times, that I knew the story-line off by heart, I could postpone reading the actual book.

This book was so, so good. i completely loved it! It was romantic, funny, and Austen's wit is what I live for. The writing was rich, but perfectly comprehensible.The best part was the characters. They all felt so real! 
 Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, oh my word. His sarcasm and her stupidity were the excellent mix; they left me splitting my sides open laughing!Oh and then *Mr. Darcy* O_O

There were many deep topics explored in this and I loved how Austen worked them into the story <3I've recently been to Jane Austen's burial place in Winchester Cathedral and been inside where the BBC filmed Pemberley (the inside of Pemberley and the outside were filmed in different locations) which added to the coolness of the book.And the ending was so satisfying.

To read this book requires one to invest time and effort - just like reading other classics - but the end result is ultimately worth it.There are countless things I could praise about Pride and Prejudice, whether it be the dense yet beautiful writing, the humor, the symbolism, etc. However, I must take time to laud the characters. Fiery-tempered Elizabeth, sweet-mannered Jane, diffident Mr. Bingley, even feckless Lydia - I connected to them all. I started this book wondering how in the world would I be able to recall each of the sisters, their relatives, and so forth, yet by the end I knew the characters' like real life friends.I detracted a star from my rating because the beginning of the book dragged on for a little too long. Once the romance picked up by the middle of the novel I was hooked though.

950,84979,135477624,it was amazing,"In the beginning, this was such a major letdown that it practically threw me off Jane Austen's work for what I thought would be forever. I'd sworn not to read any of her other books and preserve the good memories of good moments that ""Sense and Sensibility"" had brought to me instead of continuing with her other books and end up in bitter disappointment. My rationale—I was very young then—was that if ""Pride and Prejudice"" was the most popular, well-regarded and considered Austen's best by so many, yet had nonetheless failed me, then the rest couldn't be any worse, so better to stop there and preserve my one happy memory.I did give it a fairly high rating back then, however. It was undeniably well-written and well-told, and even a little chit like me could see why it was an enduring classic. But it was definitely not a story that had left any impact on me, and not one I'd have wanted to revisit. What for? I'd not enjoyed it, had I? I knew the plot and hadn't found anything particularly outstanding about its couple, had I?Times change, one matures, taste evolves, as does mindset. Now, I read genres I would've balked at when younger and like books across a wide range of styles that would've caused my younger self to drop her (scandalised) jaw. As a result, I found myself more open to giving certain books their first chance and some authors a second chance. Austen was one, and I am glad that I did, because now she has three of her books in my keeper list.What helped this time, I would say, was a shift in focus. In hindsight, I think P&P disappointed me in the past because I'd approached it with a settled idea of what it was supposed to be: a romance. That's what I came expecting to see, and it didn't work for me; because from such a viewpoint, when it comes to romance I have to care about both the characters, and I couldn't warm up to them as a couple, I didn't care about Darcy and preferred Lizzy alone. If you cannot get invested in the relationship for the characters and one of them falls from grace in your eyes, then it obviously will not work. Where has there ever been a favourite couple or romance of yours in which you detested one of them, either the hero or the heroine? Never in my case.This time round, I approached P&P not as a romance but as a story. The difference being that, when you like a book for its story, then it won't matter whether you like one character or not, for so long as you like the plotline and at least one of the leads, it will be a book you will enjoy. Many of us do have favourite books that we love to bits even if we loathe one character in it, don't we? ""Pride and Prejudice"" has a plot that centres on a relationship, but to me it's more Lizzy's story. The book is told in third person omniscient with frequent incursions into third person limited, and during those changes it's Lizzy's POV the one that's shown and whose voice we get to ""hear"" above the omniscient narrator. That makes her the real protagonist. And Darcy . . . Ah, what to say about Darcy? He, on the other hand, is deprived of a ""voice"" in the story and we only get to know him either by dialogue or by letter, which contributes also to the initial dislike he may arouse in readers, who get to ""know"" him through another's eyes. He's a great example of manipulating the reader's expectations and feelings through the initial lack of a voice that'd provide insight into his mentality, and also a good example of character evolution from bad to good to great. I am not sure how it is in the other Austen novels I've not read yet, but I'd hazard a guess that Darcy is the only example of a male character that undergoes this character evolution on-page, which makes him the most complex. He's the only one whom I know is introduced negatively and that gets ""redeemed"" later, which might be why some mistakenly think he's a reformed bad boy. He never does anything that would require ""redemption"" exactly, his negative action for which he's judged at first stems from the arrogance he's never been called out for and from awkwardness, not from dissipation or malice. Austen doesn't write bad boys as protagonists, she writes flawed men that are able to polish their rough edges.Yes, I gained a new appreciation for the male protagonist in this novel once I understood the key element is ""character evolution."" And that accounts for my greater enjoyment of the novel as a whole now that I am fully able to grasp what the story is about and appreciate both sides, and like Lizzy and Darcy on their own and together indistinctly.It's incredible what a simple restructuring of one's approach to a book can do!

951,84979,10925080,it was ok,"I've been thinking about this one now and then since I read it, First, I thought back to it while reading Nafisi's novel Reading Lolita in Tehran as it is one of the Western books put on trial by the class. Most recently, I considered it while reading Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own in which she speaks of early female writers.I had a Major British Writers teacher at university who was easy for me to like immensely. He lived in a world where television was an anathema and where he watched films like Naked and read everything from Coleridge to Irvine Welsh. His one true flaw? He also loved Jane Austen. Over the course of our class, he tried in earnest to get me to realize that Austen was a feminist writer. I disagree wholeheartedly and the only reason why this gets two stars from me is because it was written during a time when it was difficult for women to write especially publicly. I also think that Jane was a fairly keen observer of the high society that was taking place and if I enjoyed frivolous poetry that tends to go nowhere, I'd have a much higher appreciation for the writing of Marcel Proust. Really, it's such a shame Marcel Proust was born a century later and wasn't interested in women anyhow. He and Jane could have made the most boring couple in human history.One thing I want to be considered here and this is where my main justification lies has to do with women in relation to men. Women have always been seen in terms of this alone. That's why the idea of feminism is still considered rather radical today. The idea of woman as a separate identity existing in a way which she has no consideration for men in terms of how it affects her actions and thoughts is rare. John Berger explores this in (I think) his novel G about the poet Goethe and Woolf explores the idea in A Room of One's Own. In Virginia Woolf, we have some examples of the female entity as separate from the male. None can be found in any Austen I am familiar with. Instead, every function of the female is intended to ensnare a male. While it's true that the female protagonist shows some evidence early in the book of being able to function independently, it all predictably falls apart at the end, doesn't it? And what is the true goal of it all? Well, class rank, fortune, and incredibly shallow views of others. I think Jane Austen is somewhat evil actually because she's perpetuated the subconsciousness of thousands of women that these things (and men) matter more than their own identities. I'd even go so far as to say that they perpetuate the idea that these exact things are what identity is instead of the thought processes, actions, and personal history that may be separate from all of this.True, Austen was a feminist by being a writer in her time period but I would not describe any of her writing as feminist and would instead label them harmful to humanity in subtle ways of course. If you want to read a better example of early female literature that had more of a feminist tone, I'd suggest Anne Bronte's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. ",en

Oh man this was so good.I know the story of P&P pretty well, I've previously watched the BBC Mini series and The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (webseries), but until now I'd never read the actual book!I haven't read a classic in about four years, so this was a big change for me. This year I'm really trying to read more than just YA books. So yes, this did take me two weeks to read, but I had to get used the writing and the language that was used in the 1800's.It took me about a week to get 100 pages in and after then, I was used to it. Lizzy as character is now one of my favourites, she's basically a feminist. She doesn't take shit from anybody and knows what is good for her. Her sister Jane is just a sweetheart, the actress that plays Jane in the BBC mini series is so accurate it hurts! I literally could not care for her other sisters though, *cough* Lydia.Most of the time I wanted to throw a brick at their mother's head, she was so infuriating! All she bloody cares about is marrying off her daughters to rich people. And then she claims she is ill when really she's just being dramatic.I liked Mr Bennet because all he wanted to do was sit in his library and read.Mr Bingley is also a sweetheart like Jane, they're so fluffy and I love it. Again with the brick throwing, I wanted to throw a few at his sisters. Ahhhh now we talk about Mr Darcy (Colin Firth in my head), I just see him as an awkward person and it's quite funny. He realises he can actually be nice to people and they will also be nice to him.This book is wonderful, it has Darcy's pride and Lizzy's prejudice. I enjoyed every moment of it.",en

These people and their stories never get old because, although set in a different era, they are just like us. They hurt, love, hate, jest, and experience joy in every day things, just as we do. Such simple stories really, but how can we not identify with them when they could very well be happening to us. This is why I think Jane endures.

967,84979,1242892249,liked it,"Stop the press: this is actually the funniest crack I’ve ever seen - enjoy!Somewhat scalding review ensues. You have been warned.My initial criticism is the claim to romance. I love the idea of Mr Darcy (especially as Colin Firth, of course), but where the appeal lies in Austen’s original, I don’t know. In this enlightened day and age, I think we should all be able to appreciate that social anxiety should not be considered an endearing or swoon-worthy character trait. And as to his behaviour? Well, where would he be if he weren’t stinking rich, eh? Austen’s novels concern courtship; they end at the altar. Although the obsessive and all-consuming husband-hunting feels so outdated to the modern reader, it is imperative to remember the circumstances under which these women were forced to operate. It’s marriage, or destitution. Or crippling dependence at least. I appreciate that Austen has clearly worked with a view to imbuing these relationships of necessity with some degree of affinity (I refuse to say ‘love’), but perhaps this effort is undermined by the fact that she never explores the alternative. If not one of her characters recognize the consequences of marital failure, they certainly never worry about it. Becoming a dried-up old maid is viewed as a social failure, a matter of status and reputation rather than, hm, I don’t know, poverty or destitution? Maybe if she had interrogated this notion, it may well have given her detestable characters a shade more agency or at least clarify their bestial need for a husband. Otherwise, the only incentive is Mr Darcy and his posh house. The Bennet sisters are driven by idealism, not pragmatism. I don’t know whether Elizabeth’s hideous treatment of Charlotte was supposed to be a commentary on hypocrisy, but wouldn’t it have been so much more emotive if Austen had chosen to explore Charlotte’s alternative?Emotive, that’s exactly what Pride and Prejudice is not. I don’t care how much John Mullan preaches that Austen can do emotion, I don’t see it, honey. Taking into account the time in which the novel was set, written and received, it’s clear that Austen would have needed to conserve the stoic reserve of the time period just to be taken seriously. But she doesn’t offer any credible insight into the emotional turmoil of her characters to counteract that looming social factor, something which becomes all the more damaging since their motives lack such gravity (see previous paragraph) the narrative is certainly never emotionally compelling. For such a quiet novel in terms of dialogue, it lacks effective introspection despite Austen’s pioneering use of free indirect style. I also find her rather clipped prose far too distancing. To put it more finely, for me, Pride and Prejudice a sterile and bloodless slog. Austen is certainly a perceptive writer, I’ll give her that. At a push, I can excuse her startling lack of passion (or even a twitch of emotion) as an acute focus on a character’s morality. Shame that they’re devoid of soul then, isn’t it? For all the dainty exposition we’re fed, the characters are never afforded the opportunity to gather a personality, let alone depth. The only people who are even vaguely credible (or likable) are those larger than life. Take the maniac Mrs Bennet, or the highly questionable Mr Benet, or Lydia’s ‘wild’ approach (well, wild for the Regency era anyway). Even Mr Collins is somewhat compelling in his gently repulsive way. These select few are a welcome ray of sunshine amid an otherwise insipid and archetypal cast. Lady Catherine is a typical antagonist caricature; overbearing grande dame, always has her own way etc. etc. Ditto, Wickham is your run-of-the-mill scoundrel/ dastardly villain. Whilst the sisterly dynamic on the whole is wonderful, the supposedly close relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is an ongoing enigma. Jane is the meekest woman ever to grace the pages of a book. If she were a real person, she would be eaten alive (and I don’t think I’d step in to save her, either.) She’s hot… but that’s pretty much it. So much for agency, eh? My unconditional hatred, however, is reserved for that bitch Elizabeth.She’s flawed, yes. She’s realistic, yes. I’m not denying either. What I’m saying is: she’s a bitch. Sorry to put it so bluntly, but I will allow no room for shades of meaning. On an elemental level, she’s a cliché. ‘Not like other women’, gushes Mr Darcy. We wouldn’t condone this sort of statement in any literature nowadays, it’d be the target for many a piss-take, so why excuse it in Austen, I ask? What puts Elizabeth a notch above any other woman? She’s a pretentious, supercilious, sanctimonious, hypocritical snob. In short, a nasty bit of work. Despite what is asserted as a compassionate relationship with her best friend Charlotte, Elizabeth quite happily gives her BFF the cold shoulder because of her ‘poor’ choice in husband. (Again, see paragraph one for the damage this does, in my opinion.) Even though it is a truth universally acknowledged that Mr Collins is a moron, there’s no consideration of Charlotte’s pragmatism and desperation for financial security. Effectively disowning your best friend because you’re holier-than-thou is not exactly an endearing or admirable action. Austen’s girl hate strikes again! Elizabeth exercises another healthy does of hypocrisy when her regard for Darcy flips on its head in a split second: she hates him, she hates him, she hates him, *claps eyes on Pemberley*, ooh this place ain’t too shabby, wouldn’t mind living here, she loves him, she loves him, she loves him. The scale is tipped by money, despite the apparent lack of regard for financial security (again, paragraph 1). She marries out of gratitude and greed, not love. So much for compassionate relationships. And as for Elizabeth Bennet being hailed as the ultimate feminist icon? Has no one read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall? Helen Graham, though also vaguely sanctimonious, is a badass yet nurturing bitch who will call you out on your misogynistic shit, give her girlfriends unconditional support and would rather live free in a hovel and generating her own income than in a grand manor house in a loveless (and abusive) marriage. Take that, Elizabeth. I rest my case.Going back to John Mullan now. He insists that Austen is ‘the best at dialogue’. Well, let’s interrogate that, shall we? Also bear in mind that Pride and Prejudice is considered a romance as well as a comedy of manners. Austen's monologues are unnecessarily convoluted, and she just brushes over what should in theory should be the best (and most romantic) bits. For example:He expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.WELL, WHAT DID OUR ROMANTIC HERO SAY THEN??!Ooh, ooh, here we go:He told her of feelings...proving of what importance she was to him.*facepalm*Shock, horror: I don't worship Austen, and especially not Pride and Prejudice. Sacrilege I suppose, since I was born and grew up in 'The Jane Austen County'. But ultimately, her work is just far too sedate for me. Although this is mildly satirical, it feels to me more like a trivial manifesto that shies away from any moral, emotional or psychological complexity. Neither is it a scathing social commentary even twitching for reform. Even Winston Churchill agreed:What calm lives they had, those people! No worries about the French Revolution or the crashing struggle of the Napoleonic Wars. Only manners controlling natural passion as far as they could, together with cultural explanations of any mischances.And the gloriously complicated and passionate Charlotte Brontë: Why do you like Miss Austen so very much? I am puzzled on that point. (She's just read Emma.) And what did I find? An accurate, daguerreotyped portrait of a commonplace face; a carefully-fenced, high-cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of a bright, vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck. I should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen in their elegant but confined houses. The Passions are perfectly unknown to her.Amen.",en

He luchado en vano. Ya no quiero hacerlo. Me resulta imposible contener mis sentimientos. Permítame usted que le manifieste cuán ardientemente la admiro y la amo.
.:I'M IN A JANE AUSTEN STATE OF MIND:.Nadie me dijo que me sentiría así. Siempre mencionan Orgullo y prejuicio por ahí, todo el mundo lo conoce... (y si no lo conocen, va siendo hora de que lo conozcan, ya sea por la película o [preferentemente] el libro). Nadie me adelantó que la pasaría tan bien leyéndolo, ¡y duró tan poco! Este libro, o en realidad, esta clase de historias, te hace creer que el amor realmente existe. Que la gente se enamora en serio. Porque, figúrense: en la novela los personajes pasaban meses sin verse, y sin embargo sus sentimientos no eran menos sentidos, ni menos pasionales, sino en cambio parece que la lejanía temporal hacía que los encuentros se volvieran más anhelados y sustanciosos. Más allá del romance y la etiqueta, la novela refleja el comportamiento típico de la época. Me sorprende lo importante que era la superficialidad de las cosas, el aparentar, lo triste que era pensar en vivir soltera toda tu vida, cuánto importaban la virtud y el defecto, y también cuánto uno podía desear el mal para el otro, ya fuera su vecino o un enemigo acérrimo. Nunca faltaba el comentario tacaño o superficial de la madre de las cinco hermanas, o alguna galantería con respecto a la belleza de la hermana mayor, o viceversa, algún crudo comentario con respecto a lo poco agraciada que eran las demás hermanas. También me sorprende que los parientes adultos pudieran decir con tanta tranquilidad que tenían ""un hijo preferido"" o ""un sobrino preferido"", supongo que hoy en día eso se mantiene, pero ¿cuál padre es capaz de decir a viva voz que prefiere a un hijo por encima de otro? Sorprendente, en serio. Hay algo que me molestó, pero que fue un simple zumbido de mosquito a lo largo de la novela: muchas veces parecían olvidarse de la hermana del medio, Mary, cuyo papel en la historia es tan minúsculo y comparable con el de las criadas de la casa. Si la mencionaron cinco veces a lo largo de la novela, es mucho decir, y para colmo, había otra Mary en la historia, hija del vecino, ¡que tuvo más participación en la novela! Por lo demás, no tengo de qué quejarme. Jane Austen nació en 1775 y murió en 1817. Murió con 42 años. 42 años, gente. Me lamento que no hubiese vivido más, de lo contrario hoy seríamos legatarios de más historias suyas, repletas de talento e imaginación. No puedo pasar a explicar lo mucho que detesté a Mr. Darcy al comienzo de la novela, y eso a expensas de mi conocimiento sobre la historia, dado que ya había visto la película de 2005. Aun conociendo el final, aun conociendo la verdadera personalidad de don Fitzwilliam Darcy, pude meterme en la historia como si fuera totalmente nueva para mí, algo que debo enteramente a la autora. Sin más que decir, despido la reseña con una frase que pude rescatar de un personaje no muy querido, pero que por más que lo haya dicho para caer bien y en plan falso, lo encontré muy acertado: 
[...]En mi opinión, no hay placer mayor que la lectura. En compañía de un libro uno se aburre mucho menos. Cuando tenga casa propia me creeré muy desgraciada si no poseo una excelente biblioteca.

This is one of my favorite books of all time!!!
I was way excited back then, 20 years ago, about the movie (minus the controversial scene portraiting San José, Costa Rica with a beach in the middle of it). Trust me. I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San José and we don't have a dang beach around.I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country? Who cares?Well, I care, I am from that precise third world country. When you would have your capital cities portraited in a wrong stereotypical way, you will understand me. (And don't get me wrong. I love the movie and I am fan of Spielberg's work, just pointing out my feeling about that scene that even in the book happens in another different place).I love the book, since the author, Michael Crichton, lived a lot of time in my country, Costa Rica, and he fell in love so much with our culture and geography that he wanted to use it as background for one of his novels.The novel became his most famous book. In the book, you can realize how well Crichton indeed knew about our places using specific real places like the Cabo Blanco Biologic Reserve and the Puntarenas' Hospital Monseñor Sanabria. You don't came out with places like that with your quick internet search. You need to live here to know things like that. Of course, Nublar Island is a made up place but hey, no problem there, it's like Gotham City or Metropolis, always there are space for another fictional island in literature.I was lucky to get my paperback copy of Jurassic Park just when the movie was on its hype 20 years ago, since thanks to that it has the logo of the film (see? I don't hate the movie, just questioned that dang scene).I love my edition of the book since never they published ever again the book with that cover, so it's one my priceless posessions in my library.

“Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.” 

 Jurassic Park has all the major problems of a theme park, a zoo...and genetically altered prehistoric animals. That's right - the dinosaurs are back from the dead and nothing - I repeat nothing - could go wrong...right?
Ha. 
As my favorite character, Ian Malcom would say, 
All major changes are like death. You can't see to the other side until you are there.
 Though, considering some of the problems they had with the park, I strongly believe that several of issues could've been predicted...that is, if Mr. Hammond and his scientists would've taken the time to thoroughly consider implications and consequences  of bringing back extinct species. Dr. Allen Grant, Ellie, Ian Malcom and a host of other professionals (along with Mr. Hammond's grandchildren) are invited to the island to give their expert opinion  on this un-extinction.Of course, this visit comes at an excellent time - there is a huge storm rolling in, the raptors are getting restless and there's some evidence that the smaller dinos have made it off the island. 
Perrrfect
But don't mention any of this to Mr. Hammond or his staff - they won't listen to any negativity.. As Ian Malcom said,
“They don't have intelligence. They have what I call 'thintelligence.' They see the immediate situation. They think narrowly and they call it 'being focused.' They don't see the surround. They don't see the consequences.”
Predictably, the storm rolls in, things go very, very wrong...and soon even Mr. Hammond might have to admit that there may be an issue or two in his precious park. 
“You know, at times like this one feels, well, perhaps extinct animals should be left extinct.” 
If I had to pick a single, defining movie from my childhood...this would be it. So, of course, I had to pick up the book to see how it compared. It definitely delivered.In this novel, Mr. Hammond wasn't quite the bumbling, grandfatherly figure he is in the movie. And of his grandchildren, Lex is certainly younger than her movie-version (and young-Lex was more than a little annoying). This is one of those rare cases where the movie is not being a true-to-book adaption, but they are both equally entertaining and delightful. Highly recommended!And just like when I was a kid, I am comforted that if this dinosaur apocalypse ever happens, things would play out like this: 
“God created dinosaurs. God destroyed dinosaurs. God created Man. Man destroyed God. Man created dinosaurs.""""Dinosaurs eat man...Woman inherits the earth.”

Welcome..... to Jurassic Park's reviewI remember back when I was a kid, my dad rented a VHS (yes, the legendary VHS was real, young ones) cassette of an English movie. I think I was seven years old and my favorite pastimes were collecting gravel, screaming and making my sister's life hell. Watching movie was not one of them. And that movie changed it all. And no, It wasn't Citizen Kane. It was the legendary Jurassic Park! But it took me almost fifteen years to pick up the original novel. (I am still not sure why it took me so long) And surprisingly, it was not what I expected.
Story
When advanced genetic engineering breaks the very basic laws of nature by creating an extinct life form, billionaire John Hammond decides to turn that discovery into the best damn attraction the world has ever witnessed: A Dinosaur park! But the investors of this ambitious project gets spooked because of some recent events and seeks a second opinion. They invite Paleontologist, Alan Grant, paleobotanist graduate student, Ellie Sattler, famous mathematician and chaos theorist, Ian Malcolm, and a lawyer representing the investors, Donald Gennaro for a guided tour of the park. The unique voice in this story belongs to Ian Malcolm who spends most of the time warning others about the park.So everyone went ahead with the tour and...Well, let's just say things didn't go as planned.
Hey, I've watched the movie gazillion times! I don't have to read this book.
Stop right there. The book is so very different from the movie. The movie is a visual spectacular that tells an adventurous science fiction story. While watching the movie, you will be shouting "" yay, Dinosaurs"". The novel (almost) paints the same story, but its focus is on something else entirely: The science. The very idea of creating life out of nothing, the dangers of unchecked development and the proof that you can not control the uncontrollable. Also, there is a healthy dose of chaos theory, Dragon curves, Dinosaur's evolution and survival! Throughout the story, you'll be likeOverall, Jurassic Park is one helluva a ride. It might not be as thrilling as the movie, but it is a hell more meaningful and informative!",en
975,526270,18616006,really liked it,"I always seem to forget how good Jurassic Park is. I blast through it once every few years, throw it on my shelf and the distance slowly makes me derisive, and then something forces me to pick it up again when my brain needs a little peanut butter and jelly dipped in hot chocolate, and I am forced to admit that Jurassic Park is a damn fine novel. Sure it's packed with Michael Crichton's usual band of screenplay-adaptation-friendly archetypes, sure it derives much of its plot and thought from Arthur Conan Doyle, HG Wells and Mary Shelley, sure it's pulpy and quick to read, but those things aren't necessarily bad, and Crichton does enough to elevate or alter these elements to make Jurassic Park a fine piece of popular Sci-Fi in its own right. Yes, the characters are there to serve the plot. Each has an important skill or skill-set -- Muldoon is the ""Great White Hunter,"" Malcolm is the chaos theoretician, Grant and Saddler are the paleontologists, Tim and Lex are the kids in peril, etc., etc. -- and who they are and the how their stories unfold are easily altered or even cut entirely in the shift from book to screen because they are less important than their skills, yet Crichton still manages to make them likable enough that we care about what happens to them. None of the characters are dynamic or round, but their static flatness makes them no less interesting than a character like Ian Fleming's James Bond. They may not be as memorable as Bond (although Ian Malcolm has some pretty impressive popularity for a supporting character), but they don't really have to be. We can forget them after the book is over, then enjoy them anew when we go back to the book later. They aren't Hamlet, but they work.And yes Crichton borrows liberally, but he borrows from the stars. He uses Shelley's classic creation-gone-mad trope, and he blatantly thieves from Doyle's Lost World and Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but he does it with style. Granted it's a pulpy style, but that pulpiness is an asset. It takes those pieces he's combined and lets the reader catch mere glimpses of them outside the roller coaster car as he takes us into drops and curves and spins and loop-de-loops. The speed and pace nearly makes us forget from whom he's borrowing. And that is by design. Crichton's pulpiness is pacing, conscious pacing, and as literary action-oriented plotters go, Crichton is a master of speedy obfuscation.Add to all that some memorable tirades about science and reason and the environment, some kick ass Velociraptors and T-rexes, an excellent scene with toxic eggs, and some rather insightful criticism of ""great men,"" and Jurassic Park is a book that I predict will stand the test of time. We may not see its future today, but fifty to a hundred years from now it will be taught in schools and remembered, while other, more literary books will be forgotten. later --  It just struck me that if I forget the quality of this book between readings, and I do, then my prophecy concerning Jurassic Park's staying power is probably flawed. I think I may be more Nostradumbass than Nostradamus. ",en

PLEASE NOTE THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT A BOOK THAT BECAME ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MOVIES OF ALL TIME MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO, GROSSED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND CHANGED THE WAY WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL EFFECTS FOREVER. IF YOU CONSIDER ANYTHING IN MY REVIEW A “SPOILER,” THERE’S A GOOD CHANCE YOU WERE CREATED IN A LAB FROM SOME FOSSILIZED AMBER.It all begins with a billionaire who has a big imagination and a lot of spare money lying around. By dropping a ton of dollars into the biotechnology field and really thinking outside the box when it comes to the wheres and hows of DNA sample collection – John Hammond has figured out how to bring dinosaurs back from extinction and now dreams of creating a theme park unlike any other. What he didn’t plan on was the fact that science is often unpredictable . . . 
 “The history of evolution is that life escapes all barriers. Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously . . .”

Now on to my super literary review:
I honestly believed I had read this book back when the movie came out. It turns out my brain foiled me once again and I actually had not. Bottom line: senile brain = bad, reading Jurassic Park = good. Man oh man I had no clue what I had been missing. Spare me your “oh but it’s sooooooo science-y and I got bored before the story really took off” or the “you do know there is no way this could ever really happen, right????” talk. I don’t care. Yes, it is super science-y and yes, dinosaurs still aren’t free-ranging on an island off the shores of Costa Rica, but it doesn't change the fact that this book is phenomenal. I had given Spielberg so much credit (even knowing his film was based off of this book), but the credit is all owed to Michael Crichton. Not only are the characters/dialogue/etc. ripped right out of the book, but Crichton did it so much better. Sure, certain unforgettable scenes were created purely by Spielberg(view spoiler)[

(hide spoiler)]but there are literally HUNDREDS of pages of action that were not included in the motion picture, additional plot twists, new dinosaurs and other surprises to prove to all that Crichton’s original was sheer genius. In fact, after reading Jurassic Park I questioned why some parts of the original were ever changed for the film at all. Of course I realize that not every page of a book can be included in a movie adaptation, but the changes in Lex, Tim, Ellie and Grant’s characters were unnecessary and the changes to Hammond are almost unforgiveable. Hammond was never meant to be portrayed as a well-intended old fool, but rather a mad scientist much like Dr. Moreau. I’ll refrain from saying more as to not spoil the reading experience for all, but trust me when I say if you liked the movie, you’re going to love the book.
I know, Jeff. I know. It’s hard for me too.Copy provided by my local library who deserves a shout out since their “what you should be reading” pop-up screen finally picked a book I might actually like.Here’s a bonus Dr. Malcolm gif for everyone who realizes he’s the sexiest mathematician to ever walk the Earth . . . 
He can chaos my theory anytime.And here’s a bonus Brundlefly gif for Jeff  since he refuses to acknowledge the magic and wonder that is all things Goldblum . . .

977,526270,1321537336,it was amazing,"So, straight to it. Jurassic Park, the book, is inimitable, apart from a few clumsy attempts. One thing that differentiated it from its wannabes is that, unlike books about sharks, snakes or let's say, zombies, dinosaurs come in very varied shapes. This means that the way the casualties meet their end is just as variable. Michael Crichton props up his last act with inspired flair and experienced cunning. He knows that the action in this book will go only so far, just like last acts in an all out comedy movie WILL be lame, unless something rash and daring is undertook. The soliloquy (for us) of Ian Malcolm are just like the morphine that the doctor prescribed for him. Malcolm's rants about science are dishonest but it's all in good jest. The verisimilitude of Isla Nublar is out of this world. The landscape, the computers, the dinosaurs, the genetic restraints that shackles the dinosaurs, and lastly, the human protagonists in the book, are so well imagined, arranged spatially, manipulated to create tension and pacing, that I recognize the hand of a master entertainer at work. Spielberg, eat your heart out. The ultimate slap in the face of conventional science fiction is the fact, that Jurassic Park takes place in our timeline. How gutsier can you get? The book is now half forgotten, but that will change when the next wave of genetic manipulation arrives. Jurassic Park can have quite a few interpretations that pertain to civics, science, philosophy, and of course maths' sexy cousin, Chaos Theory! The only thing that matters though, is that the book makes good on its promise and gives us more than what it says on the tin; pure fun.",en

979,526270,581249715,did not like it,"At the risk of offending what looks to be all my male goodreads friends who loved this (none of my female friends have read it, which is remarkable but probably not random), I couldn't finish it. It wasn't the multiple viewpoints or so-so prose, it was the science. I worked for awhile as an assistant paleontologist--field, prep, and curating--and I promise you, pretty much everything in the first 50 pages on this topic is wrong. I wasn't loving the book anyway, and kept finding random factual errors (passports not needed for international travel? You can't possibly fake a fax of a x-ray?) But the scenes on the fossil ""dig"" did me in.1) you don't clean fossils in the field. You get them out of the field and into the lab, where you have air scribes, microscopes, safe places to rest them, and far more tools than you can schlep on your back out to the field.2) ""bits of bone flaked away as he dug."" Then he's an incompetent idiot. You do everything to keep ""bits"" from flaking away. A bit IS the fossil. If this happens in the lab, you stop, stabilize, get a better prep person if you have a real star at it in your group, or you just quit. Plenty of fossils remain only partially exposed in museums trays because they are too friable to clean further. They're still useful. Just because it isn't on public display to wow the kiddies doesn't mean it isn't there. This Alan guy, he just keeps ruining the fossil. When real paleontologists flake a tiny little something away, they beat their breasts and curse and sometimes even cry.3) They have the only egg site in the world for this species, and they're using jackhammers on it. Seriously? Jackhammers? We didn't own one. We wouldn't have taken one if it were a gift. You preserve the data at all costs, including leaving it the heck alone, if need be. Jackhammers may be rarely used with huge, whole specimens, if your team can drag a generator that far, but not in this case--never ever would that happen. 4) The broken bones get tossed aside and whirred up into fragments... No. Broken bones are also useful. Very useful. Broken bones get collected, cleaned, and curated. Museum collections are mostly of fossils that are partial. The only fossils I ever saw thrown away were some that got lost from their documentation and were therefore useless.5) ...from which DNA is extracted. Not even in a million-year-old fossil, much less a 190-million-year-old one. When you crunch up fossils into sandy bits, all you get is sand.6) rubber cement. Very big for stabilizing in 1903. Not so much when this book was written. A plastic resin dissolved in acetone is used, like polyvinyl butryal. ... and so on.You simply cannot make that many factual errors and I continue reading. My suspension of disbelief is gone long before the monsters come on stage. This is the third of his books I've tried, the second I've given up on before the end, and all three were just riddled with errors. And he was already famous--he could have interviewed anyone before writing. Why get it wrong when he could have, with a few hours of work, gotten it right? Maddening.",en

Crichton demonstrates his accomplished talent for story telling and though this is my first of his novels (and so I have no basis for comparison), this will not be my last.While Alan Grant is the thematic and contextual protagonist – the paleontologist dropped off on an island teaming with REAL LIVE DINOSAURS!! – Crichton uses the rock star cool, black dressed, philosophical chaos theory mathematician Ian Malcolm as its spiritual guide for what this book says once the adrenaline has run out.

985,526270,1373860710,really liked it,"I can't believe how much I enjoyed this book. I guess I've always had my reservations because of what an impact the movie had on me as a kid. I was about 9 or 10 when the movie first came out and it blew my mind. As the book likes to point out, boys love dinosaurs and that was true.As a side note, I'm loving how much my son (5 y.o.) loves dinosaurs. He knows so much more about them than I do, in fact his favorite is the Giganotosaurus, a dinosaur I learned existed from him.(the hipster's T-Rex)Now, I'll be the first to admit my memory of of the movie is a tad hazy, but from what I do remember, the movie actually follows the book quite a bit, at least up until about 2/3 of the book where either my memory is bad or the books is completely different (oh and Grant loves kids in the book, which is ... opposite). More than I would have guessed, which was not a lot. There's a little more detail to the initial attacks we see in the movie and it's not quite as gruesome in parts (and much more gruesome in others). The girl gets attacked by the Compsognathus (little green dinos), or **""compys"" as they're known. **excuse my spelling, I listened to the audio and like Fox news, I don't feel the need to fact check.The park is just about ready to open and it's time to get all the consultants together to make sure it's on the right track. Thus, Grant and Sattler, Ian Malcolm, the attorney Jennaro, and a couple others are flown in. Of course, nefarious doings are going on and a competitor wants in on the dinosaur action. In comes Dennis Nedry, who is pretty much spot on copied in the movie. Excellent job Wayne Knight. He's pretty much built the entire IT system for the park and thus has quite a bit of control over pretty much everything. I don't remember his involvement in the park being this extensive, but then again, I was 9. There's a frikkin' T-REX!!!As we all know, everything goes to pot and we all know what goes from here. Even though the movie diverges from the book, we all know what goes on from here.And it's awesome. I had a blast listening to this book and Scott Brick is such a talented narrator, you don't even notice him reading. It's just pure story.A couple *important* things I wanted to point out... some spoilers for the book:1. The lawyer, Jennaro, is not as spineless as in the movie, does not get eaten while he's sitting on the toilet by a T-Rex (okay, that was an awesome addition), and even saves the day at one point by pointing out law that doesn't exist. (No, this sudden support for the lawyer has nothing to do with the fact that I have an Esq. on the end of my name ... perish the thought)2. Was Lex Murphy that annoying in the movie? I really don't remember that. She's super duper annoying in the book.3. Ian Malcolm's Chaos Theory should have been cut down like in the movie. There are a number of times he's going off about it and you're literally thinking, aren't there dinosaurs around the corner about to eat them? Does anyone care about any theory at this time besides the theory of escaping dinosaurs? Still a great character, just weird timing of his rants about corporations and such, which I'm not disagreeing with.(literally the only image you're allowed to use when referring to Ian Malcolm)4. So this book was published in 1990 and this book had maybe a total of 15 to 20 people at risk, not counting the rest of the world that could potentially be at risk by dinosaurs escaping. We're talking people you're honestly worried about dying or not throughout the book. Jump to 2015, Jurassic World, and we've got an entire park open with thousands and thousands of people at risk. Does that say something about how our society's penchant for destruction? 5. But seriously, back to Malcolm, Chaos Theory essentially comes down to - because dinosaurs are an unknown, and much like the weather - unpredictable - you're all screwed and nothing will work right. And then Malcolm gloats. Even while dinosaurs are stalking him. Now, the opposing argument in the book is that zoos exist so why can't dinosaurs be kept in a zoo? My problem is that if everyone gave up because there was an unknown then we'd have just about nothing. People go forward with the unknown all the time. Many fail, but that's how great success comes as well. I guess I'm saying I needed more to this theory and preferably when I can think about the theory and not when DINOSAURS ARE LITERALLY AROUND THE CORNER TRYING TO EAT YOU.6. Jurassic Park gets lots of crap for providing false ideas as to what dinosaurs actually looked like (see raptors). While it's true, if you ignore the story, it is explained. You know that whole science part toward the beginning, well they talk about only finding partial DNA and having to graft in DNA from other animals (which actually becomes a huge problem). This would lend toward dinosaurs that don't actually look like they're supposed to and I'm fine with that explanation. I have to say, after 25 years, Jurassic Park really held up well. Lots of the communication issues would be the same problem nowadays because of the fact that they're on a remote island that cell phones would be problematic on anyway. It helps that a book doesn't have to actually reproduce computer screens so you can picture those as high tech as you want as long as you ignore the amounts of memory they mention. At least they're in the gigabytes still.And most of this I just point out because of how into the book I was. I really had a blast listening to Jurassic Park and I can highly recommend a reading of this classic.

Jurassic Park has grown beyond Crichton's novel, into a movie, into a theme park attraction, into a thousand types of paraphernalia... In fact, it has become so popular that we forget the original work this concept came from.I saw the movie first. It is a marvel of special effects and unbearably suspenseful. The book is nothing like that.This novel is a serious work of science fiction. As with Crichton's other novels, the research is so detailed and the setting so well wrought that we are sometimes conned into believing that we are reading truth and not fiction. But that does not take away from the excitement the story generates - this is by no means a dull, expository work.But most importantly, it raises important questions about the existential import of man tampering with nature - something which is conspicuous by its absence in the film.

I watched the movie adaptation when I was a kid, so I can't really remember much of the plot other than dinosaurs gone wild, and I'm sure I remember an elevator scene. Aside from those, I had no idea what was in store for me before I read this. I wasn't hesitant on reading this, but my really long TBR list was the reason why I didn't read this sooner than I should have. All I can say is that I regret not prioritizing this, because this was an amazing novel. I had two reasons why I finally picked this up, and one of them would be that it's a Crichton novel for pete's sake. The mere fact that I kept pushing it back on my TBR list was crazy of me. The other reason would be that I heard they're making a new movie adaptation, so I wanted to freshen up my knowledge of this one.The characters were really likeable, just like the ones from Crichton's other novels. Some may be funny, witty, annoying, or plain old normal. None of the characters were bad, and I don't consider an annoying character to be bad, cause a novel needs an annoying character. My favorite in this one was Tim. Stubborn young man stuck with his annoying little sister Lex. The constant bickering added to the positive attributes of both characters. The others were really good, but I guess I can't say that they were memorable. Nedry was this fat guy who I consider to be the annoying one. This novel was violent, and I really liked that. What would one expect from unrestrained dinosaurs? Obviously violence. I can honestly say that the things that happened in the novel were plausible. If a mad scientist one day decided to really invest in this, I believe there's a possibility. Anything is possible people, anything. I'm a pre-med student, and there's no saying that I may become a mad scientist one day and eradicate the human race by reviving dinosaurs. Just kidding.The plot was really good. Not perfect, but it was satisfactory. Quite similar to Micro in a way, but it had its own unique attributes. The ending clearly was not cliche in any way, because the last few chapters were awesome. Mind rattling and full of suspense.For any Sci-Fi fans out there, and especially dinosaur lovers, this is the novel for you. Stop hesitating and just pick this up.

991,526270,1275497438,really liked it,"Originally posted on Books With ChemistryWell, everyone knows what this is about, but for this review to make sense, I’m going to suppose you all live in caves and have never heard about the existence of Jurassic Park.Everything starts with a billionaire that wants more money. It has been discovered that extincted animals can be cloned and, in a way, brought back to life. He uses this to buy a remote island in Costa Rica and build a theme park that features the famous dinosaurs. Things, however, don’t go as expected and there are many disasters caused by this.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was impossible to put down, and even when I already knew the story, I found myself wondering what was going to happen next and how the characters would solve their problems, and that’s an important factor in a book.I liked most of the cast. They were varied and three dimensional. But, there’s someone I really hated, and that’s Lex.I wanted to kill Lex most of the time. She acted her age, but god, she was so so so annoying. Grant, Tim and her could be talking about something important, and then she would say something random or stupid to bother Tim. What the hell?Maybe this is a coincidende, but in all the books I’ve read and there is a kid as a major character, I hate him/her. It happened to me when reading The Shining. I couldn’t stand Danny. Most of the time I wanted to shake him and slap him and make him disappear. And now it’s the same thing with Lex! Ugh. I hate children.There was another thing that bothered me too in the book, and it is that Jurassic Park delivers the message that science (and therefore scientists) are evil – that all are scientists are arrogant and believe themselves gods and that they do what they do only for money.That’s arguably right sometimes, but I hate when people generalise things. You see, I study chemistry, and I really hate it when people think I chose that because of the money. Other times, people tell me I should have studied something else because “all chemists do is create drugs and bombs that kill people – they’re in the world just to harm.”In this book, however, is more general and it talks about ALL scientists. The one who delivers all these monologues is the mathematician Malcolm, and his speeches couldn’t be more annoying – not because of the content but because they were so repetitive.But there’s also the other message, which I rather loved, and that is not to play gods. Stories where people act like gods are fascinating and scary at the same time, and the latter point is because they always end badly. Just see how things got in this book… or look at Jurassic World, or books like Frankenstein and tell me if you agree with me.I’ve just noticed most of my review is me whining and complaining, but this book was really amazing. I loved the movie and I loved the book even more. I just had to point out the negatives.Still, I recommend this wholeheartedly. If you like the movie, you will LOVE the book. Don’t worry about my complaints – maybe they won’t bother you. The problem here was me and my impossibility of not seeing the negatives first....Pre-review:Parts of this book reminded me to The Monstrumologist, but with dinosaurs instead of Anthropophagi. Overall, it was good and I enjoyed it, but I have some complaints. Review to come.",en

But I'm glad to say that I think I may have enjoyed the book MORE than the movies! Which is really saying something because Jurassic Park is one of my all time fave movies! The only thing that stopped it from being five stars is that I found the beginning a bit slow to start. There was a lot of explanation and set up and I found it a tad boring if I'm being honest. But I can see how it was necessary to the story and it quickly picked up! Crichton paints a very vivid picture of all the craziness going on, the writing is incredibly descriptive! I think that's probably why the movie was so great, they had such a GREAT story to base themselves on! And I think that even if I hadn't seen the movie and loved it so much, I still could have pictured the story in my head like a movie because the writing is just that phenomenal! I particularly enjoyed the bits of graphs and what not that were featured because despite not being able to understand some of them, I thought they added a really interesting element to the story! And Crichton did do a good job of trying to explain them, I just have so little knowledge of scientific stuff that I was a little lost sometimes! ",en

They never stop to ask if they should do something.""In 1993, Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs to life on the big screen. At the time, Jurassic Park was so immensely popular that I would be shocked to find someone today who hasn't seen it. Now, with the forthcoming release of Jurassic World, dinosaurs are all the rage again. During a routine trip to the book store, I picked up both Jurassic Park and The Lost World for a pretty good price.Before I cracked the cover on Jurassic Park, I skimmed through a few reviews online. Many of the reviews stated that there are pretty noticeable differences between the novel and the movie. Right away, this had me excited. I'm a read the book, see the movie kind of guy - not the other way around. I find that if I've seen the movie first, I have a hard time forming my own vision in my head. Maybe I have no imagination. Who knows?As far as differences go, ""noticeable"" is an understatement. While the science behind the dino resurrection stays the same (blood from mosquitoes in amber), many of the characters are completely different. Don’t worry, Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is still as self-righteous as ever but the biggest difference is that of John Hammond. In the movie, he comes across as this overgrown child full of wonder whereas in the book, he’s this arrogant, egotistical man seemingly without compassion. He’s also infallible. The best example of this comes from the discussion on the velociraptors. In the novel, Malcolm calls Hammond out on the fact that everyone had been surprised at just how vicious the raptors were, that they often killed and maimed workers. It never once entered into Hammond’s head that they could do without one less species running around.I’ve never read a Crichton novel before but the man can really turn up the tension to eleven. The best example being the use of the velociraptors. Like the movie, they’re presented as the story’s main villains (although several characters allude to it not being their fault, that they’re just hunting and eating to survive) and the scenes in which they’re stalking the main characters had me speed reading.Aside from the raptors, you had that meat grinder on legs, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. For an eight ton killing machine, he sure can lurk in the shadows. Just when Alan and the kids (Tim and Lex) think they've escaped his wrath, he jumps out and scares the ever loving shit out of them. This leads to Lex saying on two occasions “I hate him” which made me laugh each time Crichton had her say it.For as great as the book is, I feel there’s certainly something lost in the pages. Jurassic Park is a story that is so visual that nothing in the novel could compare to seeing a dinosaur come to life before your eyes on the big screen. While I felt the original story is a lot stronger than the one presented in the movie, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. That being said, I could go on and on about all the subtle differences here and there but that would cause this review to extend to an uncomfortable length. So, I’ll just link to this page here. I would stay away from it if you intend to read the novel as it’s basically spoilers.I’ll close by saying if you've only ever seen the movie, you NEED to read this book. The sheer amount of work put forth by Michael Crichton makes you wonder if he was secretly cloning dinosaurs on the side.Also posted @ Every Read Thing.",en

I hadn’t however read the book that started it all...Going through the pages, I couldn’t help trying to find the scenes that I knew so well. Most are there, but indeed in a different form due to the medium, the same applying to the characters. What fun to hear Malcolm’s Chaos theories and witness Grant’s survival!This is a compelling thriller with a brilliant theme but somehow, having been so immersed in the movies, it lessened the awe inspiring moments. I do wonder how it would have felt to read this knowing nothing - much more powerful for sure. Nonetheless, Crichton’s novels still shines and offers a lot more than the film. Having said this, there is an element that shadowed my enjoyment: sexism. Was the world still so sexist in 1991? In my mind, it wasn’t that long ago and so I wasn’t expecting it, but perhaps yes indeed. It mostly took the shape of 'little digs’ but they were everywhere. Ellie thankfully is portrayed as a skilled scientist but Lex was truly horrible and annoying. I’m not saying that kids don’t behave in that fashion but the difference between her and Tim, who proved to be amazing, was too wide (one had all the weaknesses and the other all the advantages). At least in the film, they balanced that out!To recap, great adventure with thrilling moments.

The Tyrannosaurus Rex. About 30 feet of pure muscle with a massive head that contains the biggest set of teeth that could turn your flesh and bones into mush in one bite.You are trapped. You have nowhere to go. Your entire body is shaking. RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! You might or might not have peed in your pants.RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Your life starts to flash before your eyes.Then, out of nowhere, some asshole decides to babble on about the chaos theory, which at first seems interesting but then after a few pages you're just rooting that some dinosaur, any dinosaur would kill the smart-ass Ian Malcolm. The scientific explanation at the start was necessary and refreshing. The explanation on how they were able to clone and control the dinosaurs were also important. But that balding self-confessed rockstar who only wore black and grey really knows how to spoil some excitement. I found his endless babble about chaos and unpredictability to be quite a party-pooper, just when you're getting some inch of excitement he's gonna want to talk again. He's like a drunk preacher with an extreme fetish for grimness. There were some really nice bits of information, but I think it was a little too much. Shaved a star off because of that guy. Maybe Crichton was aiming for environmental moralism with him, I dunno. Didn't work for me, just managed to annoy me. Well, at least Jeff Goldblum managed to salvage the character in the movie. I liked him much better there. But that pretty much sums up my Jurassic Park experience. Excitement in some parts then annoyance with Malcolm, then excitement again, then there goes Malcolm again talking. You get the drift. Anyway let me give you one last roar before I end.

999,526270,1344257433,really liked it,"Ah, Jurassic Park, a keystone moment in movie history where dinosaurs were brought to the silver screen in such an indelible way. I don't think it would be inaccurate to say the movie franchise (especially with the most recent entry of Jurassic World) has significantly overshadowed the book. Heck, I only just got to reading it now, 23 years after the movie was released. Having recently seen the movie, I was struck by the differences between the novel and the movie. Some changes were welcomed, others lost some of the book's depth in the translation.First off most of the characters are portrayed a bit differently in the movie from the book. In the book John Hammond is not the lovable grandfatherly figure Richard Attenborough portrayed in the movie. Book Hammond was rather narcissistic and self-absorbed. Where as the Movie Hammond experienced some humility by the end, it seemed like Book Hammond had a restraining order out against that emotion. Nothing could possibly go wrong with his brilliant idea, the government was an unnecessary impediment on human progress, and when things do go wrong they are the fault of his (highly trained specialist) underlings and their lack of vision. He is a nice enough man if you are agreeable with him, but if you cross him he will treat you rather poorly. All in all a less sympathetic (though a bit more believeable) of a character.Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are not romantically involved in the book and there is in fact a large age difference between them. This pleased me because it allowed the characters to shine without having to devote time to a romantic plot-line or undercurrent. They are both very capable and knowledgeable in the book and easy to root for. While separated for most of the book they are very calm and collected under pressure and maintain an effective mentor-student relationship. They were great in the movie, but I think I liked them more in the book.Jeff Goldblum is Ian Malcolm, nuff said.John Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson from the movie and Park Operator), Henry Wu (chief scientist), and Robert Muldoon (big game hunter and park warden) are explored in much more depth than in the movie and provide some fascinating insights into the events as they unfold. Arnold comes from en engineering and theme park operations background. As such he views the park through his own experiences, knowing that things will go wrong and how to best deal with them. He isn't caught up in the grand vision of Hammond and treats the park problems as things that will occur as a matter of course and that can be fixed.Wu, the brilliant scientist behind the miracle of resurrected dinosaurs, views things through a highly scientific lens. He is much more interested in the process and methodology that went into creating them than the end product. He isn't married to the notion of bring back dinos as they were, but instead pushes to explore how they could be using the techniques he has developed. He clashes with Hammond on this topic, wanting to expand science while Hammond is more than content with just cranking out existing dinos and not meddling with their appearance.Muldoon is a former big game hunter turned conservationist. He has hunted plenty of dangerous game and has no rosy eyed vision on what dinos are: they are big, smart, dangerous creatures that should be treated with respect of rocket launchers, depending on what the situation calls for. He knows what needs to be done when things (inevitably) go wrong and provides a very pragmatic view of the park and its inhabitants.All in all, the secondary characters provide a wide and nuanced view of the experiment Hammond is trying to pull off. This really gave the book a very nice bit of depth beyond ""Amusement Park Tries to Kill its Guests."" Where as the movie was very much about surviving dino related deaths, the book took time to explore different views on the park and serve as a cautionary tale about pushing the boundaries of science too quickly. Malcolm seems to be the avatar of this view, noting ""Story of our species, everyone knows its coming, but not so soon."" Crichton also adds in some moments of levity so it isn't all scientific doom and gloom/raptor attacks:
""I don't see him [juvenile T-Rex] at the moment.""""Maybe he's down hunting the apostasaurs.""""He would if he could, believe me. Sometimes he stands by the lagoon and stares at the animals, and wiggles those little forearms in frustration.""
But this was by no means a flawless book. I thought Crichton got a little too hung up on technical details and spelled some things out a but to specifically when a general comment would have sufficed. This was especially true as we are shown the computer interface that must be used to save the day at the end. Speaking of the end, I felt the book end was rather sloppy. Instead of ending like the movie with the survivors flying away, Crichton decided that Grant et. al. needed to do a a head count of all the raptors to insure that none escaped to the mainland. While possible important, it really threw the flow off of the narrative. All in all, though, this book was quite riveting. Up until the end it had a great pace, fascinating characters, and a great plot. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book.",en

I have no idea how I haven't watched it yet, and I definitely want to watch it now that I have read the book, but this review will not be comparing the two since I have not seen the movie. I did really like this book a lot. I thought that the idea was really well executed and very entertaining. I know not everyone may like this but I loved all the information about genetics and chaos theory. I think the chaos theory stuff especially may have been confusing for some reader but I think it was explained very well and I was also kind of familiar with chaos theory so I could follow along well. There were some parts of this book I didn't love or just found kind of weird. I wish that Dr. Ellie Sattler had had a bigger role in this book because she really kind of disappeared after the first parts of the book. I also wish that Crichton had made Lex a little less whiny. I know she's only like 7 but I think he could have lessened that part of her personality a bit. I also thought it was very strange how the characters call some dinosaurs ""he"" when they are all female. Like there is actually a line in the book where a character explains that all the dinosaurs are female but they call some of the larger ones, like the T-Rex, males. That is so weird to me and it also feels completely unnecessary. They is no plot reason why some of the large dinosaurs need to be called males when they are females and I wish that hadn't been done. I did really like how all the parts abut dinosaurs were written and how the reader could tell and picture what all the different breeds of dinosaurs were like. Overall I am glad that I picked up this book. I definitely want to read more Crichton in the future and I think this was a good introduction to his writing. I liked the dinosaurs in this book as well as all of the human characters. It was very entertaining and enjoyable as well as educational and I definitely want to watch the movie now. ",en

His assurance that science will always go wrong makes for easy potboiler plots, but you do get the feeling that if he were a caveman, he would mistrust a sharpened stick.Crichton's sensationalism and misuse of scientific concepts has made him untrustworthy as a guide on any serious issue, but in the case of runaway dinosaurs, we do not need to heed his warnings about the 'dangers of cloning'; we can simply enjoy an idea that was ridiculous before Crichton ever touched it.At least we are spared the author's libelous personal attacks in this book.

1004,526270,1203328157,it was amazing,"I originally noticed this audiobook as a Youtube upload off to the side as I was listening to Prisoner of Azkaban for the umpteenth time. I've got The Lost World at home and I've never seen the films (not completely, anyway), so I figured Why the hell not? I haven't been a ginormous fan of dinosaurs since I was about ten, but this book cured that so quick. I was instantly back in my kid-mindset when they were first discussing the park. Just the thought of SEEING these enormous beasts had me drooling. Like. BRACHIOSAURUS. And TRICERATOPS. PARASAUROLOPHUS (my favorite, incidentally). PTERODACTYLS. EEEEEEEEEEEKS.Needless to say I watched Land Before Time the other night again and was so happy to see dinosaurs again. But the concept of Jurassic Park has brought dinosaurs into modern day and it's PHENOMENALLY written. With this book, Crichton has firmly established himself as one of my favorite writers (and it pisses me off that he's dead now), but I own Lost World and Pirate Latitudes at home, so I'm sure I'll be getting to both of those sooner rather than later, as well as picking up a hardback copy of this to complement its sequel. But JESUS can Crichton write. I can't even fathom the amount of research he put into this book. Guarantee he was an expert on everything from archaeology to genetics to chaos theory to evolution, and that's a LOT of scientific-ness to be an expert about. And the book just goes to show how important that research is, because it makes the story that much more believable. I saw in another review that this tale is very reminiscent of Frankenstein, in its warning against humans who have too much power. I have to say that while I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison, I feel like Jurassic Park is a much better example. Frankenstein is a classic of course, but when I read Frankenstein the book just seemed to drag. I remember it being overly wordy and so dry. Maybe that's because I read it for school and maybe not, but I'm definitely not as keen to reread it as I am to reread Jurassic Park.The characters are all very believable, although I had trouble keeping people separated in my head -- Grant and Malcolm got mixed up consistently and I had to keep reminding myself that they were different people (and usually in different places), and it was fun keeping Harding and Hammond separate too. Ellie and Wu and the kids were easy, and I have to applaud Crichton for bringing together such a large cast.Gonna watch the movie tomorrow!! :DAlso: (view spoiler)[THANK GODS HAMMOND IS DEAD. That loon was seriously going to just RESTART all of this madness?? THANK YOU, COMPIES!! (hide spoiler)]And then I was watching Westworld last night -- for those of you who aren't familiar, it has a similar premise of a malfunctioning theme park, but the people who inhabit said theme park are all robots, like the lovely Yul Brynner here--and I'm sitting there watching it going ""this is SO similar to Jurassic Park."" Looked it up and Westworld was WRITTEN AND DIRECTED by Crichton almost TWENTY YEARS before JP was published.Well played, Mr Crichton.UPDATE: Watched the film, liked the film, but the book is SO MUCH BETTER. The dinosaurs were SO COOL, but I didn't like how they made Malcolm all drooly over Ellie and kind of made it a would-be-love-triangle, that just felt awkward when I don't remember it ever being hinted at in the book. And he seemed like so much more of an asshole rather than the level-headed guy he was in the book. And Hammond should have stayed the same, because his maniacal tendency really freaked me out. But SAMUEL L JACKSON. YAS. Casting was perf btw.",en
1005,526270,2082049583,really liked it,"OK, so where to begin?I read this book for the first time when I was in 12th grade. We had to choose a book for a book report and I thought this would make a nice change from all the classics. Moreover, I've been a fan of the movie ever since I was a wee lass because I always had a thing for dinosaurs (the history and science behind it, the speculation, me being interested in fauna and flora in general) - other girls liked ponies, I preferred raptors.I remember being quite surprised about the differences between the movie and the book back then. Reading this a second time was no different. True, there was no real surprise anymore but I think that reading it again now made me understand the changes in the movie. I still would have preferred a faithful adaptation of course, but let's be honest: who can imagine Sir Attenborough as a ruthless businessman who doesn't give a fuck about anyone but himself?! Exactly. Thus, all the negative attributes of book-Hammond were given to Gennero, the ""bloodsucking lawyer"". Other things were changed as well in order to make the movie more family friendly. People are supposed to marvel at the dinosaurs and not be clubbed over the head with the moral of the story (playing god) and to be perfectly honest, at times I thought Crichton gave Malcom too much time for elaborations of the chaos theory and his take on the park / predictions (though the movie tones it down too much). Despite the suspense, the movie was never supposed to be quite as brutal/bloody as the book (unfortunately).Sadly, Grant's journey through the island with Lex and Tim (whose roles are reversed too, both regarding age and their skills) was also cut short simply because a movie can only have a certain length. They get to see much more in the book and the humans aren't quite as incompetent about the power outage as in the movie. What I really enjoyed much more in the book is the plot point of (view spoiler)[the dinosaurs having escaped the island and roaming the streets of Costa Rican villages (hide spoiler)] as well as (view spoiler)[those young raptors being on the ship (hide spoiler)] as both is much more plausible.I could go on and list all the other differences (minor and major) but I won't. Suffice it to say that the movie works on its own and is one I look back on fondly (and which I re-watch often), while the book is very good too. Crichton gave us a fantastical world, suspense, science (though it is a bit murky at times), and pretty good characters (though I prefer the move versions of some of them).So yeah, you can basically sell me anything with dinosaurs which is why I'll also watch the next Jurassic World - which, by the way, will feature Jeff Goldblum/Ian Malcolm!

Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it.""I also liked the characters (mostly). Again, I couldn't help but compare to the movie. Hammond was drastically different. Instead of a well intentioned, naive dreamer, he is portrayed here as power hungry and hypocritical. He can overlook deaths, maimings, even his grandchildren being endangered if it means his dream will be realized. And to him it WILL be realized. He never thinks otherwise.I say I liked most of the characters. But there was one exception. A big one.Lex. Stupid, whiny, useless Lex. She's 8, but acts like she's 5. She contributes nothing to the story except to annoy and pester those around her and almost get people killed. She never seems to realize that hey, you are in very real danger of dying a horrible death. 8 year olds get the concept of death right? Then she cries about everything; because she can't play with the walkie talkie. Or there's no ice cream. Or that Tim isn't paying attention to her. GET THE FUCK OVER IT CHILD.

Big turn-off. Plus, I don't like the creation of sacrificial lambs to be killed, paper-thin to the point of having no personality practically. The science part was a little too detailed (yes, even for a biological scientist). I think that if I want to read a textbook, I can easily do so. But, for fiction, I like the plot to have nicely-integrated factual information, and the focus to be on the characters and the unfolding storyline.Between those two issues with this book, I gave up on it.

They were in [insert location] because of [insert sciencey sounding science programme/project]."" Followed by a massive info-dump.But even when we finally got to the eponymous park, I wasn't excited. None of the characters fascinated me, and even when people started getting killed off by dinosaurs, the plot wasn't engaging. The way Crichton writes also felt very amateurish.I've never seen the movie version of this, but I have heard the main theme song and it is GORGEOUS.",en
1011,526270,2446221922,really liked it,"3.5 Stars.I listened to this in German while out walking the dogs or running.One thing Jurassic Park clearly revealed was that I definitely should not become a mother, because I would have fed Lex to the Tyrannosaurus at the first opportunity.Overall, the book was a lot of fun, but I thought the first part had too much science, the pacing was off, and it took too long to get to the part where people were being eaten by dinosaurs.",en
1012,526270,386172158,really liked it,"I figured that it was time to read the original Jurassic Park, as I recently went to see the fourth movie, Jurassic World. Basically, JW follows the same pattern as previous movies—people create dinosaurs, dinosaurs get loose, much running & screaming ensues. Still it was worth every penny just for the scene in which the Mosasaur leaps out of a pool in a SeaWorld like setting.In many ways, this novel, which started the whole franchise, is better than the corresponding Jurassic Park movie—the science is more obvious and better and the plot is a bit more complex. However, for characterization, the movie probably gives the viewer more sympathy for those doing the running & screaming. The novel does include an awful lot of computer programming diagrams & jargon—probably trendy at the time of its publication, but a bit dated now. Crichton seems to have much the same message in mind as Mary Shelley did when she wrote Frankenstein—science often seems to out-strip humanity’s moral development and just because we are able to do something doesn’t mean we should do it. Where Shelley left it for the reader to develop this thesis on their own, Crichton gets down right preachy, hitting the reader over the head with this message repeatedly (as articulated by the mathematician). And this whole idea that nature can’t be contained and that it’s hubristic of people to try—this seems to me to be a very “city folk” way of looking at the world. Ask anyone who grew up on a farm, complete with livestock, and we will tell you that there is no such thing as a fool-proof fence! Try to out-smart a pig—it’s not as easy a task as you might think. I’ve ended up using reverse psychology (open two gates, chase them towards the gate you don’t want the pigs to go out). Ever try getting a large beast like a cow or a horse to do something they don’t want to do? Good luck! You will need many people in order to accomplish the task. The horse may do what you want if you have a very good working relationship with it (I think about each year here in Calgary at Stampede time when some brave soul takes a horse up the Calgary Tower and attempts to get it to stand on the glass floored part of the observation deck—I wouldn’t do it and neither will any sensible horse!) Farmers and ranchers know their limits—they have no illusions of control when it comes to animals. I also know a substantial number of zoo keepers and they have a keen respect for their charges and know that zoo animals have plenty of time to contemplate the weak spots in their enclosures and that they are willing to test those weak spots when all the zoo staff have gone home for the evening. If it’s hard to convince a cow to do something, it can be downright dangerous to ask an elephant to do something it has an aversion to. While zoo keepers know these things, it often seems that zoo administration is clueless about animal behaviour & intelligence. When things go wrong (e.g. when an animal escapes), it is often because administration and/or architects discount the warnings of animal care staff. When Calgary Zoo opened a new building, the Colobus monkeys climbed right out of their supposedly-secure new enclosure and were found in the rafters the next morning. Modifications, previously suggested by zoo keepers and disregarded, were put into place. And seriously, how many city folk can’t even get their dogs to be obedient? So, a very good novel with good suspense and a fun premise (who wouldn’t want to go to a safe version of Jurassic Park?), but I am knocking off a star because I was smart enough to see the message without being beaten about the head & ears with it!",en
1013,526270,1303063,it was ok,"I have never been terribly impressed with Crichton's work, but I have always been told that I must read Jurassic Park to really appreciate him. I was not expecting much from this book, but I was disappointed nonetheless. The whole story seemed fragmented and disorganized. This was supposed to be about a sort of fantasy world created by an eccentric, wealthy man, but throughout the book I felt like It was more Michael Crichton's fantasy than anybody else's. It was as if he had several goals for this book and tried to find a not-too-ridiculous way to tie them all together. None of the characters are developed at all. This is a chronic problem of Chrichton's, but it is much worse here than in any of the other books of his that I have read. He simply presents a character with an age, physical description, and stated profession, and then expects us to accept him/her.I could rant for a while about this book, but allow me to wrap up with a final complaint. Chaos theory does not really apply to this story at all, yet it is woven into it to an astonishing degree. Without Ian Malcolm and chaos theory, this book would have been better and significantly shorter.",en

Do I have problems with the fact that the female characters do almost nothing? YES. But it's such a great mixture of action and science and the sudden cuts between DINO MAYHEM and then the relative calm of the control room works really effectively. Basically? I LOVE THIS A LOT IT'S FANTASTIC. 14/9/2017I continue to love this book a little bit more with every reread. Sure, it's dated. Sure, it alternates between ALL THE SCIENCE/MATHS and ALL THE ACTION. Sure, there's a grand total of two female characters (not counting the dinosaurs), one of whom is eight or nine and pretty irritating. Sure, the ending is a little abrupt. And yet somehow, it's become a comfort read for me. Go figure. 5/3/2016On reread, I'm bumping this up to 4.5 stars. Sure, it's pretty dated now, what with lines like ""When we started excavating in 1983"" and entire plot points depending on insanely antiquated computer systems. But the pacing is SO GREAT, the plot is tense throughout, and even if you've seen the movie a thousand times (like I have), you're still dying to know what happens next and who's going to get eaten by a mother-effing velociraptor. In short, it's great.16/2/2013If you start this book expecting it to be exactly like the movie, then you'll probably be sorely disappointed. It IS like the movie, up to a certain point. But at the same time, I'm fairly certain that chunks of the plot for Jurassic Park III came from this book. So it's kind of a weird hybrid of the two. A lot of it is quite scientific, which I love. There are more encounters with the dinosaurs. There are pterosaurs. The raptors plan their attacks. Various characters that survive in the movie die here, and vice versa. And perhaps most importantly, there's no set up for a sequel. It was only after pressure from fans and Steven Spielberg that Crichton even wrote a sequel! It's an action packed book - possibly to the point of overkill - and I love it. Just don't expect it to be the same as the movie.",en
1015,526270,1313829149,it was amazing,"This novel is so brilliant, I don't understand how anyone could possibly give it less than 5 stars. It was so much fun to read this after loving the movie for so many years. There were a lot of similarities to the movie, true, but it was so awesome to read this and see how much the movie couldn't/didn't include. The sheer amount of detail that Crichton put into the making of the dinosaurs and the securty systems of the park and just how the part was supposed to run is incredible. And the way that these details came up later in very significant ways to the plot was amazing. The dinosaurs were, of course, so awesome. It does take about halfway through the book for everything to go to shit but once that starts it never stops. Not even once the book ends (oh my god I frickin' love how it implies that there are raptors in Costa Rica hELL YES I need The Lost World ASAP). I loved all of the scenes with the dinosaurs that didn't make it into the movie and I literally exclaimed out loud multiple times when really exciting things happened and were revealed.

1018,526270,2517212537,it was amazing,"4,7 SterneIch bin begeistert! Nie hätte ich gedacht, das hinter einem 0815 Actionstreifen so ein gutes Buch steckt! Michael Crichton beschreibt hier sehr ausführlich die wissenschaftlichen Details, außerdem entwickelt er die Katastrophe weitaus langsamer und plausibler. Er legt den Fokus nicht nur auf das Ausbrechen der Dinosaurier, sondern auf deren ungeplante Fortpflanzung und Wandertrieb. Generell legt er sehr viel Wert darauf welche Verhaltensbiologie die Saurier entwickeln, das diese nicht vorhersehbar ist und uns evtl. vollkommen überfordert. Wie Crichton im Anhang betont sind seine Theorien bezüglich Saurierverhalten etc. nur seine persönlichen Spekulationen anhand eigener Nachforschungen, interessant sind sie allemal.Auch die Charaktere haben mich wirklich überrascht. Der Film nimmt sich hier sehr viele Freiheiten heraus und formt einzelne Personen komplett um. So ist Dr. Grant kein grummeliger Kinderfeind und Dennis Nedrys Hintergründe für den Betrug (im Film dargestellt durch den kleinen, dicken Widerling mit Brille, der den Strom abschaltet um Embryos zu klauen und an die Konkurrenz zu verkaufen womit die Kastrophe erst ausgelöst wird), sind im Buch für mich sehr gut nachvollziehbar, ganz davon abgesehen dass die Katastrophe schon vorher in Gang gesetzt wurde und Nedery lediglich den letzten Schubser gibt. Der einzige richtige Arsch ist John Hammond, im Film als netter Opi im Weihnachtsmannlook dargestellt, im Buch jedoch ein exzentrischer Egoist, der sich hartnäckig weigert Fehler einzugestehen bzw. als die Probleme nicht mehr zu leugnen sind, seinen Mitarbeitern die Schuld gibt anstatt sie in seinem kompromisslosen Verhalten zu suchen. In der Figur des John Hammond wird auch Crichtons Kapitalismus Kritik deutlich.Fast schon zynisch wird Crichton wenn er Hammond zu Wort kommen lässt, wie bspw. im folgenden Dialog in dem er mit seinem Chefgenetiker Henry Wu gemütlich Eis isst, während seine Enkel im Park ums Überleben kämpfen:""Wenn sie eine Gentechnikfirma gründen würden, Henry, was würden Sie tun? Produkte herstellen, die der Menschheit dienen, die Krankheit und Seuchen bekämpfen? (...) Die reinste Verschwendung dieser neuen Technologie. (...) Angenommen, sie entwickeln eine Wunderdroge gegen Krebs oder Herzkrankheiten (...) angenommen sie wollen 1000 bis 2000 Dollar pro Dosis dafür verlangen. (...) Aber glauben Sie wirklich dass die Regierung das zulässt? Nein, Henry, das wird sie nicht. (...) Etwas wird passieren, das sie dazu zwingt das Medikament billiger zu verkaufen. (...) Und jetzt überlegen Sie mal, wie anders das alles ist, wenn sie Unterhaltung produzieren. Niemand braucht Unterhaltung. Keine Regierung mischt sich ein. Wenn ich 5000 Dollar pro Tag für meinen Park verlange, wer wird mich daran hindern? Keiner wird mir Gangstermethoden vorwerfen, im Gegenteil, der stattliche Preis wird die Attraktivität des Parks noch erhöhen. Ein Besuch wird zum Statussymbol und alle Amerikaner lieben das.""Für Crichtons scharfe Wissenschaftskritik gibt es gleichzeitig Punkte und Punktabzug. Ian Malcoms ewiges lamentieren ohne Lösung anzubieten ging mir zeitweise etwas auf die Nerven, weshalb ich hier ein paar Pünktchen abgezogen habe. Ich stimme vielen Punkten mit ihm überein, in anderen Dingen war er mir zu pauschal, andere Dinge haben sich mittlerweile etwas verändert. Das Thema was ist Natürlich und Unnatürlich will ich hier nicht anschneiden, das würde den Rahmen sprengen und selbst ein Buch füllen.Ein paar Kritikpunkte habe ich mir herausgegriffen die hier aufführen will:Crichton kritisiert dass Wissenschaftler ""drauf los forschen"" und sich ihrer Verantwortung und den Konsequenzen überhaupt nicht bewusst sind. Genau hier hat heute glücklicherweise ein Umdenken stattgefunden. Wissenschaftskommunikation ist vor allem bei jüngeren Generationen schon fast Trend geworden. Es gibt Science-Slams, Science-Blogs und Science-Blogger auf Youtube. Im Deutschsprachigen Raum kann ich hier jedem die Kanäle Mailab (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyHD...)und The Secret Life of Scientists (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqSl...) der Chemikerin Mai Thi Nguyen empfehlen.Passenderweise lese ich gerade parallel A Crack in Creation von Jennifer Doudna. Jennifer Doudna ist eine der beiden hauptverantwortlichen Entdeckerinnen der Genschere CRISPR CAS9, womit wir heute zum ersten Mal das Werkzeug in der Hand halten Jurassic Park Realität werden zu lassen. Doudna legt sehr große Hoffnungen in ihre Entdeckung, gleichzeitig hadert sie mit sich selbst und bekam Ablträume als sie sich der Risiken voll bewusst wurde. Sie streitet ihre Verantwortung nicht ab und betreibt daher ebenfalls sehr aktiv Wissenschaftskommunikation.Crichtons Kritik am Wissenschaftsbetrieb ist leider immer noch hochaktuell. Wissenschaftler möchten wie alle anderen Menschen auch Geld verdienen und irgendwann eine Festanstellung. Das ist in der freien Forschung, an Universitäten und anderen öffentlichen Instituten, nicht möglich. Die öffentlichen Forschungsgelder sind in den meisten Bereichen so knapp bemessen, dass die Universitäten riesige Probleme haben Forschung zu finanzieren. Die großen interessanten Projekte können nur Privatinstitute und Unternehmen durchführen. In der freien Forschung heißt es alle drei Jahre ein neues Forschungsprojekt an Land ziehen, was oft mit einem Umzug in eine neue Stadt oder sogar Land einhergeht. Wenn man dann insgesamt 12 Jahre geforscht hat (inklusive Promotion und studentische Hilfsjobs) heißt es aus die Maus (siehe Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz). Die meisten Hochschulabsolventen gehen dann lieber direkt in die Industrie. Wenn der Milliardär John Hammond den Genetiker Henry Wu von der Universität abwirbt indem er sagt, dass an den Unis die Forschungsbedingungen immer schlechter werden, hat er wohl im Großen und Ganzen Recht.Ich kann dieses Buch jedem empfehlen, unabhängig davon ob man den Film gesehen hat oder nicht, ob man ihn mochte oder nicht. Besonders alle die den Film nicht mochten, kann ich dazu ermutigen das Buch zu lesen, da es deutlich vielschichtiger und logischer ist.Jurassic Park ist definitiv ein Jahreshighlight für mich gewesen.",de
1019,526270,346376195,liked it,"Once upon a time, we would find books like Jurassic Park in a typical high-schooler's bag -- a book with liberal doses of scientific information, imagination, suspense and thrill. Today however, all that floods the Young adult book market are wimpy love triangles between werewolves, vampires and humans!What a degradation! What a shame!This is just my second book by Micheal Crichton, after The great Train Robbery, and I've already turned into a fan! This guy is a real entertainer! His works are not pseudo-intellectual. If you're someone who judges books on the basis of how intelligent they'll portray you to be, if you were to say that you've read and enjoyed them, then please avoid this author.You might not be bowled over by his use of the English Language (no flowery sentences, not much difficult words), but you'll definitely be forced to finish this book in a single sitting --- its that gripping!We are all quite familiar with the storyline, so I won’t harp on that much. Instead, I’ll just quote a very thought provoking passage from the book which I really liked… “Most kinds of power requires a substantial sacrifice by whoever wants the power. There is an apprenticeship, a discipline lasting many years. Whatever kind of power you want. President of the company. Black belt in karate. Spiritual Guru. You must give up a lot to get it. And once you have attained it, it is your power. It can’t be given away, it resides in you.Now, what is interesting about this process is that, by the time someone has acquired the ability to kill with his bare hands, he has also matured to the point when he won’t use it unwisely. So that kind of power has a built in control. The discipline of getting power changes you so that you won’t abuse it.But scientific power is like inherited wealth: attained without discipline. You read what others have done, and you take the next step. You can do it very young. You can make progress fast. There is no discipline lasting many decades. There is no mastery: old scientists are ignored. There is no humility before nature. There is only a get-rich-quick, make-a-name-for-yourself-fast philosophy. Cheat, lie, falsify – it doesn’t matter. Nott to you, or to your colleagues. No one will criticize you. No one has any standards. They are all trying to do the same thing: to do something big, and do it fast.”",en
1020,526270,82025611,really liked it,"Jurassic Park is Michael Crichton's masterwork. The academics are cooler, the science is hipper, and the monsters are badder. So why haven't you read this novel?Let's look at the premise: We can use cloning technology to bring dinosaurs back, and now the fabulously wealthy Mr. John Hammond is going to sell glimpses of those dinosaurs in order to make money, ""a lot of money,"" as Mr. Hammond would remind us. Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, and Ian Malcolm are brought to a Caribbean island to vet Jurassic Park.So, Dr. Grant, are dinosaurs dangerous?You bet! And Crichton sweetens the deal by adding a hurricane that disrupts the park's security systems to the point that human ingenuity is pitted against the predatory instincts of the T-Rex and packs of velociraptors. A cage match -- to the death! -- between naturalists and dinosaurs!How can you not read Jurassic Park?Actually, that one is easy.The irony of Jurassic Park is that although it is Crichton's greatest novel, it is nevertheless overshadowed by the film adaptation. We don't have to read the book because all of us have seen the movie, and it just happens to be one of those rare films that turned out to be better than the book.It gets worse, I think. We often rely on chronology to discuss essential works, but when it comes to techno-thrillers, Jurassic Park might be the genre's greatest achievement even though it arrived decades after the originators. In terms of execution, it does everything a techno thriller is expected to deliver, and it does these things very well. We could even argue that it is better known than all but a few of its predecessors (if presence in pop culture is a valid argument).In spite of Jurassic Park's exalted status within both the genre and Crichton's body of work, I would find it difficult to claim that Jurassic Park is required reading for anyone that has already seen the film.People often debate whether the limitations of the techno thriller (prose and characterization) matter. I am quite happy to admit that I am capable of enjoying a Crichton novel in spite of its awful characterization and limited style. However, I can't help wondering whether it is the lack of creative prose and intricate characterization that allows Jurassic Park -- Crichton's greatest techno thriller and possibly the genre's greatest achievement -- to be so easily replaced by the film.",en
1021,526270,2231471076,really liked it,"I read Jurassic Park many, many moons ago. Some parts I forgot and others not so much. Other parts I got confused with the movie which I haven't seen for a number of years as well. The bottom line is this book still has the magic of a great science-fiction adventure thriller.Micheal Crichton's story about cloning ancient dinosaurs into the modern world through the miracles of genetic engineering is highly imaginative. He approaches the story on so many levels through the characters. There are moral issues, greed, ecological implications, ambition and an ingenious application of chaos theory to a fictional story. A parable of humanity's audacity of thinking it can control something larger than humanity itself. Topics that continue to have significant relevance in the 21st century. In addition to all that, are colorful characters and top notch action thriller.The above is one heck of a lot to pack into a story. To that end, the story has a tendency to drag in parts, gets kind of preachy and becomes just shy of a geekfest. I didn't remember when I first read the book that some of action sequences seemed cliche. Maybe they 
weren't 
 when I read it then but do now. I don't know. My memory isn't all that keen. And it really doesn't matter. I still found myself flying through the pages of action scenes.As a rule, I don't reread many books because there are so many good books I haven't laid eyes (and ears) on yet.

Dinosaurs… thank you Mr Chichton! Tyrannosaurus RexI remember vivivdly my first experience of watching Spielberg’s adaptation of  Jurassic Park in the big screen. It left me drooling, wide mouthed and quite simple in awe of what I had just seen! Much like the rest of the audience, I was blown away by the CGI (early in its inception), and dinosaurs come to life! The story plot was fantastic, and a premise that was so simple, that its design was predicated on 2 variables: dinosaurs and humans! DILOPHHOSAURUSFast forward 24 years later, and I finally get around to reading Crichton’s masterpiece, and it blew me away!! Even after many years of his death, Crichton still inspires generations with his ‘plausible’ story of dinosaurs come to life by the tentacles of genetic manipulation. The book, originally published in 1990, is extremely well written and researched. Crichton's writing manages to still give me a feeling of dread and keep me on the edge of my seat. The use of his medical knowledge combined with the fantastical element of dinosaurs as the villains really makes it come alive. VelociraptorSome surprising deviations in character development and scene progression, make the book a superb read and thrilling story! I won’t spoil the fun, but some characters that are endearing in the ‘movie’ are downright bastards in the book! Also, there are quite a number of more ‘deathly’ scenes involving dinosaurs eating humans in the book!  DINOSAURS EATING HUMANS=FUN!!!Dinosaur snacking on human Jurassic Park is a hell of a sci-fi ride which will bring the inner child in all of us who secretly longed to live in a world that was free from pollution, technology, cell phones and human interference.

1025,526270,1973465487,really liked it,"Quiero empezar diciendo, que la forma en que Michael Crichton ha construido esta fantasía científica es gloriosa, todo en torno a el Parque Jurásico es extremadamente detallista, tanto a nivel científico como logístico y nos lo cuenta de una forma que es muy realista, los primeros capítulos en los que te detalla como han conseguido dar vida a los dinosaurios, en que se basa el mantenimiento del parque y sus mecanismos de seguridad, me han parecido los mejores de la novela sin ninguna duda, seguramente tenga que ver lo mucho que me apasiona la ciencia.También me ha gustado muchísimo la narrativa, es posible que en cuanto a descripciones, sea un estilo en general bastante ligero, sin grandes pretensiones, pero aún así es capaz de transportarte en cada escena al lugar exacto en el que transcurre y hacer que sientas la tensión de cada momento, a veces basta con las palabras adecuadas, también es verdad que nos deja diálogos buenísimos, y soliloquios respecto a la naturaleza, la vida, el caos, el ser humano y lo que se hace a si mismo o al mundo, la ciencia y la forma en la que la estamos usando..., que son de gran belleza, y muy interesantes.El punto más débil que yo diría que tiene este libro, son su personajes, aunque hay 3 que me han gustado mucho, sobre todo Nedry, me ha parecido un grandísimo villano, aunque por supuesto lo odias y deseas que muera de alguna forma truculenta, también comprendes sus motivos y el porque hace lo que hace. Por otro lado está Hammond, es algo así como el director del parque, me encanta lo loco que está, aunque haya muerto mucha gente y sus nietos estén perdidos a saber donde, el sigue pensando únicamente en el bien de sus dinosaurios. También quiero hablar de Malcolm, este es el personaje que Crichton utiliza para transmitirnos todas esas ideas de las que antes he hablado, es algo así como un sabio que está todo el rato profetizando las desgracias que ese parque va a acarrear, es un personaje interesante y necesario. En cuanto a los demás, hay muchos que son completamente planos, que están ahí de fondo, figurantes para hacer que la historia avance y morir comidos por algún dinosaurio en el momento que dejen de hacer falta, lo malo es que son tan planos que cuando mueren provoca indiferencia o incluso alegría. Por último están los protagonistas, no es que estén mal, pero tampoco tienen un gran desarrollo, y eso por un lado hace que la historia avance rápido, pero por otro hace que tampoco les cojas demasiado cariño. Pero en general están bien.Por decir otros detalles que no me han convencido, es que los protagonistas, al contrario que los demás personajes de relleno, siempre se salvan de todas las situaciones complicadas de alguna forma un tanto milagrosa y a veces me ha quedado un poco forzado y holliwoodiense, pero eso ya es algo personal, ¿y como es posible que los del barco tuvieran a bordo a dos velociraptores durante todo el viaje y ni siquiera se den cuenta? , pero solo eso.En resumen, una novela buenísima, llena de acción, sangre, ciencia, algo de filosofía, aventura, muy aconsejable.PD: La película me encanta, pero el libro me parece mucho más completo.",es
1026,526270,2444650323,it was amazing,"Because I’ve seen the movie adaptation of this novel, I thought I knew the story. I usually scoff at people like that, but for some reason, in the case of Jurassic Park, I felt only seeing the movie was sufficient.I was wrong.Steven Spielberg’s big screen version of Michael Crichton’s Dino tale differs wildly from the source material — almost as much as Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining. Yes, most of the characters herein are found in the movie, but their personalities are different, expanded upon . . . and the fates of many of them are different too.So how does this book stand on its own? From the start, it is a gripping science fiction thriller — emphasis on “science.” I am not scientifically inclined, but no matter. Crichton takes care to explain the mechanics of Jurassic Park, without getting bogged down in details. If the science in the movie is wonky (and that’s putting it kindly), the science presented here is plausible. To this reader, anyway.My only complaint is Lex, a quite insufferable little brat who adds nothing to the story. I like the changes Spielberg made to her character for the movie; in the novel she is a spoiled child who does nothing but complain. She was almost enough to make me drop my rating to four stars, but I just can’t make myself. Jurassic Park is a marvel, an icon of science fiction . . . and rightfully so. It speaks to the malevolent wonder of nature, and the dangers of playing God. I thoroughly enjoyed this.",en

1029,526270,36159366,really liked it,"I really enjoyed this book. I saw the movie of course, numerous times, so I had an idea of what to expect going in, but I was still pleasantly surprised by the book. More so after not liking The Andromeda Strain, which was the first Crichton book I ever read. I have to say, this was a classic case of BBM: Book's Better than the Movie. As I read this, I had the movie playing right along in my head. There were some substantial differences, more background information on the characters as well as a bit more technical & scientific background given, but these things only added to the book. Firstly, the character of Lex always annoyed me in the movie. She was cast as an older tomboy sister to Tim, but acted nothing like the 12 or 13 year old she was supposed to be. In the book, shes 7 or 8, so her actions make a lot more sense. The book also didn't have the typical Spielberg/Hollywood ending, meaning that the characters in the book didn't just fly off into the sunset to resume their normal lives and live happily ever after. The book ending was much more realistic and much better for it. I don't know much about Crichton's political views, but based on the two books I've read so far, he seems almost to hold a low opinion of scientists. In The Andromeda Strain, he repeatedly pointed out the scientists' flaws and shortcomings and failures. I didn't much enjoy that book, so that could be coloring my recollection. In Jurassic Park, Crichton uses every opportunity to show the irresponsibility of scientific advances as a whole. He uses the mathematician, Dr. Malcolm, as the main voice of reason and sanity, and explains why science is inherently irresponsible. John Hammond, the mastermind behind Jurassic Park's creation is depicted as a man more concerned with money than with whether or not what he's doing SHOULD be done. And that's really the point that Malcolm strives to make. Yes, making trout pale so as to see them more easily in the water is possible, but does that mean that it should be done? No, not necessarily. I've heard it said that Crichton was adamantly against the idea of global warming. As I don't know much about his views myself, I will base this next sentence completely on what I read in the book. I agree with him. Again using Malcolm as his mouthpiece, Crichton shows the fallacy of the idea that mankind is destroying the planet. The Earth's been around for a couple billion years, and will most likely survive anything that we could do to it. Humans may not survive, and for THAT selfish reason, we should take better care of our home. (Although, in my opinion we should do it because it's the right thing to do.)Anyway, I really liked this book. It was fast paced, and definitely kept me interested from start to finish. I'd recommend it. ",en

“Welcome...to Jurassic Park!” 

The Jurassic Park movies are my life. I’ve watched all of them about a million times, and I adore everything about them; whether it's watching dinosaurs ripping off human arms or watching herds of dinosaurs almost trample all my favorite characters.Just kidding. Sort of, lmao.But this book is a solid 3 star reading. I don't know if it's because I read a hardcover (I never read anything besides ebooks), or because it took me two months, or because the movie is just so much better? I compared this to the movie a lot (sorry, couldn't help it), so here's some stuff I noticed:1. All those lush, beautiful scenes in the movie were unfortunately not described in this book. It was a more straightforward writing style as opposed to poetic or super descriptive. Instead we got explanations of the genetics, physics, the chaos theory, + the legal aspect of the making of the Jurassic Park. Which may sound boring, but I found it incredible (though, tedious at some points).2.  John Hammond the sweet old man from the movie, is actually a very manipulative, low key psycho who pours billions upon billions into this park with his/investors money. I’m talking 
super computers, powerful lawyers, world class chefs, top scientists, military equipment to handle the dinosaurs, and a freaking gigantic island off Costa Rica’s coast.
3. The characters were identical to those of the movie! Alan Grant, Ellie, Ian and the whole crew’s pretty much all there. They also all act exactly as they did in the book which made me miss them in the movies!! So, basically, it’s a more in depth version of the movie - pretty descriptions and + lots more science. All the characters, events, and pretty much everything else stay the same aka it’s still awesome, action-packed, and pure entertainment. However, the writing style will definitely be something people might instantly dislike if they try this one so just a warning! ALSO. I fuidcjkong hate my life because lucky me found a DISTURBING photo of John Hammond while looking for JP gifs and now I don't know if Jurassic Park will ever be the same. See at your own risk.(view spoiler)[WHY. JUST WHY.  (hide spoiler)]",en

The movie was so suspenseful haha.This is my first book by Michael Crichton, his writing is captivating and perfect for such exciting reads. It really made things come to life. What made it less so were his chapters where he went deeper into the science behind it. Very interesting and well written but it really took you out of the suspense. At some point is was chapter gore versus chapter science.I found this at the same level as the movie, both are evenly great and have their own strong qualities. A fun read if you like dinos :)",en
1034,526270,1317369102,it was amazing,"'God creates dinosaurs, God kills dinosaurs, God creates man, man kills God, man brings back dinosaurs...woman inherits the earth'This book. This book. My God. This is for sure, one of the best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. No joke. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. I had never heard of Michael Crichton (Cry-ton) (I had no idea how to say so fyi) and, to be honest, I had no idea Jurassic Park was a book until I stumbled upon it in Dymocks a couple of months ago. I even thought it was one of those ridiculous movie-to-book situations, so I avoided it. But I am so, so glad I listened to my gut and gave in. Michael Crichton is a genius. This man knows how to write, god damnit.I will give a word of warning though, this book is very information heavy. I mean, you need the information, this book solely relies on you understanding what is going on, so you really need to be prepared for it if you want to start it. It is very science based, of course. But I really think you only need to understand the fundamentals of science; what science does, why there are scientists, pretty basic stuff. You get everything explained to you so there's no need to worry, but yeah, just as a warning, you get everything explained to you, so if you're looking for a book that's just BAM BAM BAM ACTION IN YOUR FACE, a lot of this book is not for you. If you don't know what this book is about, you've likely been living under a rock for your entire life because HAVE YOU NEVER WATCHED A JURASSIC PARK MOVIE IN YOUR LIFE?? WHAT WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD??. I've always been a big fan if you can't half tell. The novel is basically about a very rich man, John Hammond, who buys his own island, Isla Nublar, and hires the most ingenious scientists to create clones of extinct dinosaurs using the DNA that they find in prehistoric flies that have been fossilised in amber (those big transparent yellow rock lookin things, you know what I'm talking about). Archaeologists and mathematicians and, unfortunately, children, come to see the park to see whether it is safe for public knowledge. And it ends with the humans taking the dinosaurs home as pets because dinosaurs are actually the most friendly species on the planet...right? Haha lol no. I love books that can make you think and change your views of things, and this book delivered on that. Dr. Ian Malcolm is a mathematician in the novel (who is played by the acting-God, Jeff Goldblum in the film), and he comes across almost like a philosopher,to me. He predicts that things will go awry in the park, and nothing will end up working, the dinosaurs will escape etc etc. And no one believes him obviously, because he's a mathematician!!! What would he know!!!! Science RULES!!!! The things he says...I found myself just waiting for his next speech concerning the park and the dinosaurs and I was just in awe of what Crichton thought up. It was so thoughtful, yet so scary to think of the way man is. I often found myself sitting back and thinking, fuck, I had it all wrong didn't I? This man knows what he's talking about. I know nothing.The novel is mainly focused on three characters, though. Dr. Alan Grant (played by Sam Neill in the film), Tim Murphy, and his little sister, Lex Murphy, who are Richard Hammond's grandchildren. (You can open the spoiler if you've seen the film) (view spoiler)[After the electricity turns off in the park, they are attacked by the Tyrannosaurus Rex, and after making a quick escape, are constantly stalked by the Rex, while also being attacked by many other dinosaurs along the way. (hide spoiler)] I really loved Alan Grant, I found him fascinating and an incredibly likeable person, as well as Tim, who was a very clever young boy with an engaging personality, but I hated Lex. Oh my God, I feel horrible saying it because she's only 7 or 8 years old, but God she did my head in. She was the most whiny insufferable little child I've ever encountered in a book, and she did absolutely nothing to help, other than point out dinosaurs that were behind them while they were trying to save her ass. One thing that was a little odd to me in this book was how quickly everyone got over the idea that there were living dinosaurs on this island and they were literally staring at animals that have been extinct for millions of years. Like, they were told and they were like, WHAT? And then a couple of pages later they're explaining to other people like oh yeah so this island has dinosaurs if you didn't know. So nonchalant. How can you be nonchalant about that? If I found out that I was going to come face to face with Velociraptors and the T-Rex I would be shitting in my pants the entire time. ESPECIALLY, if I was one of the first people to see them??? How would you even know if that's safe??? YOU CAN'T KNOW. Another character I couldn't stand was Hammond himself. In the movie, I don't remember having any particular hate towards him but God he was the most ignorant person ever. Also Dennis Nedry. How can someone be such an asshole????? He got what he deserved though, so I stay happy. That's another thing to warn people about. Some of this book can be...quite descriptive. There are quite a few people that die, which is to be expected in a book about freaking dinosaurs, but some of it was pretty gruesome. I mean, I love that stuff, so when I read certain parts I just shouted 'AWESOME' but, it's not for some people, so if you're weak, yeah. One quote that I absolutely love was an exchange between Ian Malcolm and Hammond. They're talking about people who have power, and the way they misuse their power when they haven't trained their discipline. Malcolm: A karate master does not kill people with his bare hands. He does not lose his temper and kill his wife. The person who kills is the person who has no discipline, no restraint, and who has purchased his power in the form of a Saturday night special. And that is why you think that to build a place like this is simple.Hammond: It was simple.Malcolm: Then why did it go wrong?'Hammond has the firm belief that the park was easy. It's easy to maintain and the animals were easy to make, everything should be easy easy easy, and he even sticks with this belief for a long time after the animals begin to run amok. Malcolm's character had such a sassy but elegant way of shutting people down, basically, because he was smarter than him. He actually wasn't such a main character as I thought he would be, but he's made such an impression on me. I highly recommend this book, particularly if you're a fan of the films. This book was 100x better, and I love the films. ",en

The thing I remember most was the truck's glass shaking in cue with the T-Rex's footsteps. Deliciously suspenseful. Does the book hold up?As plots go, let's face it - this one's simply awesome. Who doesn't dig dinosaurs to some degree? It brings out the wonder and child in all of us. And man is always itching for yet another story to slap his hand and warn him about playing God in the black dangers of SCIENCE. Du-du-dum! So besides dinos, mad scientists, we get cool smart people who make funny comments, children who get on the nerves, a huge island, convenient storms, and fried state of the art security. Rock on!While the entire novel is good, the beginning is where it's really all at. Such fun creepiness and buildup sets the mood. Being of mediocre wit myself, my patience DID lag with some of the many, many technical eplorations/jargon whey they first come to the island to flaunt their expertise, but I still give props to Crichton for holding the pacing level, even if the expected climax climb is from slightly predictable circumstances.Characters are an intriguing ensemble. First, the little girl irritated me to no end, and I ended up loathing the devilish girl-child almost immediately. Sadly my hatred didn't fade as the pages turned. Her whining was atrocious. Oddly, in the movie she is the older and more secure one, but in the book the younger. She consistently makes dangers worse, doesn't listen, puts others in precarious situations, and made me want to shake her. Ian Malcolm's dry wit is likeable enough but in the novel he's barely around. The mad scientist is unpleasant and stands as a different sort from his film version. The dinosaur scientists are just average. And yes, as before, Crichton does tend to invent characters for the sake of story.Crichton's writing is nifty, although I did find an occasional error and think he relies a little too heavily on the ""comma just in case"" method. Still, he charmed my inner reader with wording that's plausible and easy to take in. He comes across as having a beef with science. Not just because this is a precautionary tale (that doesn't always mean anything beyond good story telling), but he also puts in a foreward and injection of thoughts on the irresponsibility of the scientific establishment in general.The T-Rex is focused on more in the book than the film. While the raptors stole the cinema-light there, T-Rex ruled the roost here. There was an especially creepy water scene while he is giving chase.Overall this book is certainly worth the hype and I'm pleased they chose to make it into a blockbuster film. They had plenty of excellent source material to draw from, even if they changed a good amount. Genuine chills, tension, fascinating subject material which works with new twists. Chilling more than suspenseful - especially the two opening scenes with the bitten man carried to the isolated medic and the little girl getting a nasty surprise on the beach. If you're a fan of the movie (or, if you're not), still check out the book.",en

Full Review
This is one of those rare books I read after the movie. I read it sometime in high school. I don't exactly remember when. However, I remember seeing the movie the first time vividly. I was not quite 11 years old. The perfect age really. I convinced my mother to take me to see it while my sister was away at camp. The movie both fascinated and terrified me. It's one of the few movies that have stuck with me so vividly over the years.By the time I got to reading the book I was a bit older, and that same sense of wonder had started to wear off. I was too young to enjoy the pseudo-science, and the action in my imagination just didn't live up to my memories of the movie. It was a good book, but ""the movie was better"".With the 25th anniversary last year, a new audiobook got released, and I was interested to revisit the book. It was a lot better than I remember. I enjoyed the ""science"" better this time around, although the computer related stuff made me go: ""Yeah that's what you get for tampering with such a complex system"" a lot.It's been a long time since I've seen the movie now, and I plan to revisit it. This seems like one of those rare movies that doesn't tweak too much from the book. It's almost as though Mr. Crichton wrote it to be made into a movie. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that was true.My favorite Crichton book is Timeline (whose movie adaptation is absolutely awful), but this book is probably my second favorite. The way he uses pseudo-science to create thrillers seems unmatched. This series is arguably his most successful. He takes our childhood fascination with dinosaurs to the next level. He also highlights the arrogance of men. You might think if given the chance, we'd be smarter than the characters in the book, but I'm not sure that'd be true. I fully believe if it were possible to recreate dinosaurs some greedy idiot would totally do it. There is part of me that'd want to visit the park too. Meanwhile the rest of my brain is screaming what a terrible idea it all is.All and all, this book is a fun ride full of wonder, terror and a lot of stupidity. I'm glad I revisited the book. ",en
1041,526270,1360765595,liked it,"3.5 stars. I love the film of Jurassic Park, so of course I was excited to find that the unabridged version of the book had been released on Audible earlier this year. The narrator, Scott Brick, is also a favourite as he had previously narrated by favourite audiobook of the year Helter Skelter. It took me around two weeks listening to this on and off to finish it, and probably would have taken me less time if it hadn't been a bit slow to start off. There is a lot of build up to the main events within the park itself, and there is a lot of scientific talk which can become a little hard to follow when listening as opposed to reading. Obviously the scientific elements of the book had been very well researched, and were all rather convincing for a science n00b like me. The action was where it was at though - as soon as those dinosaurs were release, all hell broke loose and I loved it. The deaths are pretty graphic, which appealed to me, and tension was built up really well (particularly that raptor scene with Lex and Tim).The main issue I had with this book though were the charactes. I found them for the most part to be quite flat and one-dimensional, and I found it quite hard to tell the various park staff apart - if I had re-watched the film more recently, it may have been a little easier. The only character that I felt had some real personality was Lex - and I hated her! She was the most annoying, bratty child I have ever come across in a book I think, and she got everyone into needless trouble more times than I can count, through sheer idiocy. I know she was meant to be like 7 or something but still. Sigh. I also found Ian Malcolm's character to be a little irritating - the constant talk of chaos theory started to grate on me very quickly, and his long speeches towards the end became quite unbelievable.On the whole though I did really enjoy this audiobook - Scott Brick once again did a fantastic job of varying the voices and was particularly good performing the kids' roles which I hadn't expected. I hope I find more audiobooks that appeal to me narrated by him, I know I can wholeheartedly trust him with the storytelling.If you're a fan of Jurassic Park the film, you'll probably enjoy this audiobook. However, I do prefer the film - the book has a somewhat unsatisfying ending, and it is just a bit too long for me personally. It's still incredibly entertaining though.",en
1042,526270,2410034401,really liked it,"I'll never look at Jurassic Park the same way again and by that I mean the movie. I think the book shows a much harsher and more realistic view of how things could be if such a park existed. I see the movie toned some things down (like Hammond, mostly, although I'll be having a hard time hating Richard Attenborough with a passion like I hate the book version) and left out a few of the more gruesome deaths, so I think JP is still considered to be a family movie (or at least that's how I experienced things) and the book is a lot ""heavier"" if you ask me. Mostly, I'm the kind of reader who almost always says ""the book was better"" but in this case I don't know. I like both of them, in their own way, even with the already outdated technology but the book managed to make the desolate and isolated feeling creep up my spine in a so much more real way than the movie ever did. I feel like the book was more about survival of the fittest and there were times where I was really on the edge of my seat while reading this.For nostalgic reasons, and for the fact that I can now point out every difference (which my husband will love), I'm going to watch the movie again soon. It's his favorite and I just cannot let the opportunity to annoy the crap out of him pass.",en
1043,526270,1059359411,it was amazing,"Is it wrong for me to so thoroughly enjoy people being eaten by dinosaurs? I mean, this book had a lot going for it, but that's the main highlight, and it's SO SATISFYING. My face was doing all kinds of weird things while I read. I'm sure most people reading this will have seen the movie. I found that it really helped me to picture the dinosaurs (and surrounds) and that made it that fraction more terrifying because when you can really visualise what's happening it's much more horrible. I think, though, as in most cases, the book is better here, because there's so much more discussion about the lives of these animals, and the implications of bringing them to life. I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed Malcolm's rambling. He makes some valid points, that dude.As for Lex ... *sigh* Little, bratty Lex. What can I say? I kind of wished she'd been T-Rex chow. Ah well. You win some, you lose some. *shrugs* Timmy, on the other hand, is a true hero-in-the-making. Grant and Ellie were pretty cool, but nothing special in the hero department. The dinosaurs were the real heroes of this story, and I was totally okay with that.

I'll be honest, I never wanted to read this book. Yes I saw the movie in the theater and I really did enjoy it, and saw all the films that followed. (so-so on the sequels). I had read Andromeda Strain and did not enjoy it...at all. After that I wasn't in a hurry to read another of his books.I remember when Jurassic Park came out and while the whole theme park idea was new, this story rang a bell in my head. Dinosaurs in the 20th century? And then I remembered, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had written of the Adventures of Professor Challenger in his novel ""The Lost World"" (and yes, dinosaurs were discovered in the 20th here too). I noticed that Crichton didn't give props to the Grand Master Doyle and even went on to name the next book in the series, ""The Lost World""...WTF??? REALLY??? Never will you read in his acknowledgements or Thank You's, ""Thanks to Sir AC Doyle for his great story of Professor Challenger, blaa blaa blaa"". Hell, Anne Rice gave props to Doyle for his mummy stories, ""Lot 249"" and ""The Ring of Toth"" in her book, ""The Mummy"", and her book was 100% completely different than his mummy stories. ...this basically sealed Crichton's doom on me reading any of his books....then the years passed....then Crichton passed away....then we got a 4th movie.So I was at the used bookstore and got his entire collection on soft back, for 5 cents each!

When I petitioned to read this book, mom and dad shot it down (and at that age they held the purse strings) and tried to get me to read some book about Medieval Italy (boooooring).Two years leter, they caved and let me get this book. It was wonderful.Crichton is hit or miss from what I'm told, but this is really, really good. It blends science with the fanciful notion of bringing back long dead species from the realm of fossils and artifacts to living, breathing - and frequently violent - fruition.It is a tale of man's reach exceeding his grasp, in which dinosaurs - both of the docile and predatory breeds - have returned to a small Costa Rican island. The idea is to create a nature preserve and theme park out of the scientific advances that make the place possible, but as the inhabitants brought to the island are soon to discover, there is trouble in paradise. A violent storm and an act of corporate espionage remove all safeguards from the island, releasing vicious tyrant lizards upon the trapped populace.The movie is good as well, though Hollywood spared some characters whereas the book made sure the lethality of the dinosaur race was never too far away to get comfortable. You can, however, stop here. There was one more book written as a sequel to the movie version in which a key character is still alive, and from there you really can just put it down. From what I'm told, the Jurassic Park sequel The Lost World may as well have been named The Search For More Money.",en
1048,526270,423061070,it was amazing,"An Exciting, Realistic, Terrifying Technothriller""Jurassic Park"" is one of the most engrossing technothrillers ever written as Mr. Crichton masterfully hooks the reader with the opening description of the genetic engineering company and the victim of the velociraptor. The scientific descriptions read true, the philosophy adds power, the kids are cute and create sympathy, and by the middle of the book you will totally believe that there is an island in Central America where an eccentric billionaire has decided to build a prehistoric theme park. While Hammond is an antagonist who is easy to dislike, what he says does make some sense; you have this great scientific ability, but if you create the cure for cancer, the government isn't going to let you charge any price you wish. Right? So instead use it to create an uber-expensive theme park where the luxury buyer can take their kids for a peaceful tour of dino land. Of course, everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, as the saying goes, and Jurassic Park is a prime example of why man should never try to control nature, especially something as awe inspiring as dinosaurs.The flaws: Jurassic Park lacks flowery descriptions and similes; it includes a realistic outline of a futuristic technology but is somewhat outdated with some of its references (e.g. the use of corded telephones and the novelty of a touch screen computer); and it does become somewhat preachy at times with exposition given by a certain character.The bottom line: Once the story is believable (which happens in the first hundred pages) you are simply caught within Crichton's grasp and you won't be able to put this one down.",en

1056,526270,1422801477,liked it,"“Frankenstein“, “The Island of Dr. Moreau”, “The Lost World”: classics works of proto-sci-fi that I love. I mentioned in a recent review that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. In that case, I hope Shelley, Wells and Doyle feel honored by Crichton’s insane, over the top, pulpy novel. I remember being just old enough to go see the movie in the theater when it came out and loving it, even if I confess to hiding my face behind my hands during the infamous T-Rex car chase scene (I was 9; give me a break). My mom got the novel a few years later and I tried to read it then, but the scientific stuff was a bit complicated for me at the time, and I got bored quickly and abandoned it. Having read Crichton’s “Eaters of the Dead” this summer, I got curious about his other work and in a fit of nostalgia, found a copy of “Jurassic Park” to sink my teeth into. My mind couldn’t stop comparing the book in the movie, and to be honest, as much fun as the movie still is today, the book has a very different focus that I had not caught on when I was a kid: Crichton wants to talk about ethics in science, the dangers of cloning technology, the lack of moral barometer in large industries, his frustrations with unreliable computers and the all-mighty power of mother nature to squish us if our hubris gets out of control. This book is actually a lot smarter than I had originally given it credit for.So, in case you have lived under a rock for 25 years: a billionaire embarks on this ambitious project to use fossilized dinosaur DNA to create living dinosaurs and put them all in a big theme park on a small island off the coast of Costa Rica. Of course, something goes wrong with one of the creatures, so his legal team insist he brings on board some legitimate scientists who can attest the park and its “attractions” are safe before they open to the public. He gets a paleontologist, a paleobotanist and a mathematician to come and visit (along with his grandchildren, because why not?!). Obviously, everything goes straight to Hell when a combination of industrial espionage, general dumbassery and a tropical storm decide to all happen at the same time.While at first glance a lot of the characters also struck me as almost simplistically stereotypical, a more attentive re-read made me wonder if they actually weren’t subtly and cleverly subverted stereotypes. John Hammond is basically a megalomaniac who pays people to be the mad scientist he wishes he was. His ambition and ego end up causing injury and death to a bunch of children and he still wants his damn project to come through. I just feel that when infants are eaten alive by your creation, you should probably take that as a sign to stop whatever the Hell you are doing… Ian Malcolm is Crichton’s obvious mouthpiece (I wonder if he thought he had anything like Jeff Goldblum’s swagger…) and he is without a doubt the coolest character. His anti-science rants are a bit much, but they hammer the point Crichton really wants to make: science for its own sake, without a moral barometer, can be very dangerous. Of course, the idea that you can breed an extinct creature with unknown and unpredictable behavior and not end up with an epic catastrophe on your hands is pure stupidity, and its exasperating that only character seems to understand that right off the bat…The children’s characters, which are also very different from book to movie, are way more irritating in the book… It might be because I find children irritating in general, but their presence in the book really is an excuse for more drama, more tension and more dangerous situations; they don’t really bring anything to the plot besides making it harder for the others to just get the Hell off the island and a way from huge animals trying to eat them. Yes, “Jurassic Park” requires suspense of disbelief and the science is super wonky and unreliable. But that can be said about a lot of fun books, so I never let it stop me. Sure, there’s a lot of action, especially in the second half, but this book is not just a thriller: it’s genuinely scary (in ways woefully unexplored in the movie!) and requires you to use your brain to fully enjoy it! I wish I had read it with no prior knowledge of the movie, because the clues and foreshadowing elements Crichton scatters over the first part of the book would have been so much more exciting had I not known what was going to happen. A lovely piece of perfectly paced, quality brain junk food that was sorely needed after a week of office madness. Fans of the movie will love this! 3 and a half stars.",en

Thank goodness my reading buddy was okay with that. The first part was okay but a bit of a slog for me which is why it took me so long. But as part of my sweeping of current reads, we got it done! ?? hooray. Now for the good parts:Yes, to me, Muldoon was a pretty cool character. He was smart and knew what the heck he was doing. I thought for sure most of the others were in trouble. Some of the ones that I thought would make it did not. So, some surprises. The part by the waterfall was particularly hair raising. And the aviary. Loved those. Hammond was extremely selfish in the book, and like a grown up baby! He was seriously narrow minded too. And while Malcolm’s speeches did make sense to me... could the guy not say just one sentence—ever? Tim and Grant made a good team. Ellie turned into a track star/mongoose. But yeah. Cool. Whatever. Lex drove me batty; what a brat ! Half of their predicaments were bc she wouldn’t shut up. Ugh. We will probably read the next one soon. It was a fun adventure, digging through poop and Ellie scraping her nails on pustules and various members examining excretia and the concept of life finding a way even when you try to change it. Not the only book I have read where you try to cut off something’s way to breed and it finds a way. I find that so interesting. Sorry for the gross stuff, folks.

1061,526270,1956145435,it was amazing,"In 1993 my parents took me on vacation to Florida. It turned out to be a quite peculiar trip. First we had an emergency landing in Neufundland, because of a hole in the airplane. One I had a pretty good look at from where I was seated. Then there was a shark alert while we were at a Miami beach. And on our visit to the Universal Studios in Orlando we passed on the Jurassic Park attraction, because none of us had ever heard about it.The shark turned out to be a ray. And while the hole in the airplane was an actual hole in the airplane, nobody got hurt. Apart from a few hours of fitful sleep on an airport floor and us arriving late at our destination, fortunately nothing happened there.So missing out on Jurassic Park stands as the single most annoying thing that happened to us on this trip. Although my parents would probably go for their son puking for the better part of the return flight to Germany. But this wasn’t because of some suddenly developed fear of flying. It was rather because of my insistence to eat pizza shortly before takeoff. So no, Jurassic Park is the one thing that stays with me.Oh and somebody tried to puke on my shoes during the Back to the Future ride. There seems to be a recurring theme here with this vacation.Today I am fond of the Spielberg movie. Though I wish it was a bit more scary. But the sense of wonder at this long extinct animals is captured fantastically well.It was the most successful movie of all time from its release in 1993 until James Cameron decided to sink the Titanic on the big screen and Leonardo DiCaprio claimed to be the King of the World.Also it massively stirred interest in dinosaurs. I was one of many kids collecting magazines and dinosaur figures back in the nineties. The star of the show was always the T-Rex of course.Though in the book it is not. At least not in my opinion. But more on that later.The book starts out quite suspenseful. With some attacks by unknown animals on children and infants mostly. When one infant gets bitten its face off, it became clear to me very early that this book may take a bit of a different direction compared to the subsequent movie. The latter had its thrills of course, but it also had to be PG-13 (12+ in Germany) to reach a large enough audience.Nonetheless most of the first half of the book is a big adventure. It feels like an actual trip to an amusement park, with an interesting look behind the scenes and even more interesting lessons about the science. I had so so much fun, I tell you.The characters were done pretty well, I think. We don’t get much of a back story on most of them. But I don’t think it is necessary for a book like this. The dialogue is good and they are distinctive and mostly entertaining. The exception being Gennaro and Regis. I couldn’t much tell these two apart. But this gets resolved early enough by one of them having a rather unfortunate encounter with a dinosaur. Also little Timmy sometimes felt a bit too mature for his age. But again, these are minor complaints. The stars of this book are the setting and the animals anyway.Crichton manages to alternate between scenes of exceptional sweetness. That make you go awww how cute is this and scenes of suspense, dread, thrills, when people try not to get killed by one of the not so cute dinosaurs. Mostly he gets the balance right. This makes the book kind of a rollercoaster ride, where you get the thrills of being scared and relieved and scared again, enjoying it all the same.There’s no harm in knowing the movie, which I assume almost anybody does. The narrative develops quite differently here. Though some of the most remarkable scenes of the book were also put on the big screen by Spielberg. But even these tend to play out a bit different here.The book offers a bit more suspense compared to the movie and definitely more gore. Without exaggerating it.The second half of the book is way more about terror and survival than wonder. Which is fine.Unfortunately some issues showed up as well.Malcolm (my favorite character in this book and the movie as well) took a bit of a backseat after having a prominent part in the first half. And worse, when he starts to play a more prominent role again, he also started to get a bit annoying. I enjoyed his lectures about chaos theory and his know-it-all attitude early on. But in the latter stages it sometimes got a bit over the top.Also the Tyrannosaur was a bit uneven. It’s the one dinosaur where Crichton didn’t get the balance right in my opinion. When the T-Rex takes on the scene I want to be nothing but scared. That didn’t always work out for me. There’s especially one point in the story, when the author again manages to show a very cute scene involving another dinosaur and then immediately follows this up with a bit of a clumsy T-Rex outing. Since I was already in a cutie cutie mood there, I almost felt like I wanted to pet the T-Rex. Not a good idea, by the way. If you happen to meet a T-Rex in the streets or at the supermarket checkout or at your local hairdresser, DO NOT PET IT!It wasn’t like the Jurassic World mess, where the T-Rex comes to the humans rescue and they just let it wander off afterwards and everybody feels safe again. I’m still not over that. But it was a bit out of place nonetheless.Fortunately, if you want mean, we still have the Velociraptors. They take center stage in the last fifth of the book. And bloody hell, try not to wet your pants.The ending made up for whichever little flaws there were after the midway point. On the whole this is a fantastic book which was tremendously entertaining.By the way, I googled the Jurassic Park ride in Orlando the other day. And I learned that it didn’t open until 1999. So whatever Jurassic Park “attraction” we missed back then was probably not that exciting after all. We still did Jaws and King Kong and Earthquake. So I had my fair share of scares anyway.",en

1063,526270,1529695436,it was amazing,"Jurassic Park might be the most infamous theme park in popular culture. For a reason. Who doesn't remember watching that scene in Steven Spielberg's film in which the massive T-rex chases the jeep? Don't even pretend not knowing what I'm talking about! But turns out the book the movie was based on went way further than any blockbuster ever could have. And I loved every second of it.The story is easily retold: When a technique for recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA is found, an entrepreneur hires the world's leading scientists to create Jurassic Park, where creatures extinct for eons roam around with all of their awesome presence and mystery. What sounds like the grandest project humans have ever taken on, is obviously bound to go horribly wrong...
""Because the history of evolution is that life escapes all barriers. Life breaks free. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.""
Surprisingly, it is stunningly smart. Unlike the film adaption, Michael Crichton is telling an intelligent and thought-provoking cautionary tale that illuminates the concept of chaos theory and its implications on our world. It asks the question of whether we as a human race should really play God and push scientific progress as far as it does. Crichton is occasionally being quite harsh on science, which is an interesting stand-point not often portrayed in literature that vehemently: 
""But now [...] science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old. But science cannot help us decide what to do with that world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. And our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental ways - air, and water, and land - because of ungovernable science.""
The characters are well-developed and varied. I enjoyed how different they all were and how they felt like true individuals. Founder John Hammond is (unlike his film persona) not the loving grandfather kind of guy, but a profit seeking opportunist. His grandchildren Tim and Lex felt like believable kids, with a lot of enthusiasm and occasional annoying moments. Paleontologists Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are not a couple here, but teacher and mentor and I enjoyed not having a romance interrupting the action of this story, because there definitely was enough going on anyway!The story is packed with things happening. It is easy to see why it was made into the movie it would later become, as reading it already felt like being part of a proper adventure. There is not a lot of filler material, but we're constantly encountering new dinosaurs or dreading for some character's life. Speaking of the dinosaurs: you can tell Crichton has consulted paleontologists as part of his research for his novel, as his descriptions reflected science's level of knowledge of that time. All in all, this was a fun adventurous action-novel that made me relive not only early memories of dinosaur-related enthusiasm, but also learn a few new perspectives on things. Definitely worth a read, even 25 years after its original publication.",en
1064,526270,298139112,really liked it,"I sometimes refer to this as ""the only genuine science fiction novel Michael Crichton ever wrote,"" by which I mean it's his only science-based thriller in which the genie doesn't go safely back in the bottle at the end. In Sphere the alien powers are wished out of existence; in Prey the free-roaming nanobots are swatted down, in The Andromeda Strain the titular pathogen mutates itself into something non-lethal, but in Jurassic Park something extremely dangerous escapes the controlled environment of the park's island and enters the jungles of South America. There are consequences to the events of the book that don't resolve themselves neatly on the last page, and that's pretty damn refreshing compared to Crichton's overall body of work. This is a thoroughly fascinating book for its mix of scientific and engineering perspectives. Ian Malcolm's chaos math-babble is somewhere between mad prophecy and total claptrap, but it's still far more deeply explored than the caricature version that made it to all the JP tie-in media. Ellie Sattler's perspective as a paleobotanist is even more startling; if you want to have your head spun, ponder a view of life that sees plants as operative, dominant factors in earthly life and animals as thoroughly controlled by them (some animal populations are poisoned or driven off, others are symbiotically sustained). Crichton also provides juicy and engrossing details on the troubles endemic to major theme parks and zoos. As much as I have a soft spot for the 1993 film and its wonderful dinosaurs, this is a more effective telling of the tale. The children are not featured characters, the adults are not as shallowly sketched, the action is surprising and often quite harsh. Highly recommended, just skip all the sequels, comic books, and films, save perhaps the first. ",en
1065,526270,188897550,it was amazing,"One of my favourite books. It has dinosaurs! Sure, there are paragraphs of chaos theory that I just skip over, but DINOSAURS!! Edit 9/10/16 - My previous review is piddly, so let me expand on this: this book thrills me. I first read it about 20 years ago, I was 13, and I loved the movie. My uncle lent me the book, and I was amazed at what had changed from book to screen - the waterfall scene, the aviary, so many more (and kind of gross!) deaths. It quickly became one of my favourite books.Yes, there are lots of pages and paragraphs about chaos theory and scientific stuff, all stuff that I usually skim (or skip), because what really matters in this book are the DINOSAURS. They're exciting and interesting and thrilling and even though I've read this book a million times, it still excites me so much to read it. The audiobook brought a different dynamic to the book, I think. Where I can understand people may find Lex kind of annoying while reading the book, listening to the narrator say her lines in a whiny voice just made me laugh. His voice was great in tense situations, making them even more exciting. All in all, one of my most favourite books, and one I will recommend to anyone. ",en
1066,526270,217198087,liked it,"Sometimes I worry that my taste in books is getting really snobby. Then I read something like Jurassic Park, and realize that that is exactly true. I can't just sit back and absorb the brilliantly original (as far as I know) idea and the deftly told action scenes. For some reason I have to quibble over awkward sentences, clumsy exposition, and strange dialogue tags. I can't accept Crichton's weird Luddite agenda, even though ordinarily I'd agree with a lot of his points, because he tries to sneakily insert it in a novel, which I find offensive, if only because it thinks it's in disguise. I fixate on Malcolm, Crichton's snide author-stand-in (notice Malcolm always wears all black, and then see Crichton in his author picture -- all black!) whom, again, I'd probably like if not for the nagging feeling that someone is trying to indoctrinate me.I've read almost every Crichton novel, and I never got around to this one because I'd seen the movie so many times.

Son más humanos, cometen más errores (si es que es eso posible viendo como acaban).Hay momentos en los que se dan demasiados detalles; intestinos por el suelo, a alguno se lo comen vivo...pero eso es parte de la magia de estos animales.Eso sí, después de haberlo leído creo que si algún día se atreviesen a crear dinosaurios no me gustaría estar nunca a menos de mil km de un velocirraptor que tuviese una mínima posibilidad de poder escapar.Le doy un 9.",es

The characters were quite believable in this book and made me wonder more about their take on the whole idea of bringing these creatures back to life. By the end, thank goodness, we were all in agreement about killing them.

I cannot express the amount of love I have for this, the whole book was just so action packed I was just on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. No lie!!?I’m a huge fan of all the films, so I went into this book thinking that I already knew the story. Well I was wrong. I mean yes Spielberg’s adaptation does follow closely to the book; with a few changes mostly towards the end, but I actually got a lot more information and background about the dinosaurs from this book. There was a lot of details about genetic research, DNA and the science behind the making of the dinosaurs, and there was so much about the animal’s behaviour too. Some of the science did go over my head a little, but much of it just made the world building so much richer.?I found that some of the characters in the book were different from the film. For example Hammond was a much more stubborn and darker character. His principal concern was that his island made him an abundance of money. He never once took responsibility for any of the disasters that occurred. I loved how the book became philosophical in nature and made you look at the moral and ethical debates in the advancement of science.?My favourite parts were with the dinosaurs though. There were some awesome tense and gory scenes with the T-Rex and Velociraptors, but also some heartwarming scenes with the baby raptors. Crichton is definitely a master in suspense, you never knew which character would survive or not!?So don’t be a fool like me and have this sitting on your shelf, pick the goddamn book up and read it!

Not even an urge for spicy chicken wings (...okay, that one's a lie. I did have an urge for spicy chicken wings and I submitted to it).I had an urge to watch Jurassic Park. It was obsessive and I tore through several legal and some...um...back of the truck options to find this movie and satiate the urge, but it was nowhere to be had or my computer couldn't play the file. Steven Spielberg must have a vice-like grip on his intellectual property, because Hulu+, Netflix Instant View, and even ITunes were sadly devoid of this cinematic masterpiece.(Ironically, I went to Kaua'i in the midst of this frenzy. I didn't know that JP was filmed there at the onset, but once I did my JP focus became all the more acute.) I did eventually get to watch the movie one day while Dan was nursing a bad sunburn in the hotel room and watching Starcraft, and I read the book immediately after. Are the book and the movie different? Yes. Are they both pretty enjoyable? Heck yeah (provided you like that sort of thing...which I do.)Jurassic Park, the novel, gave a lot of background that the movie summarized in the helicopter scene and the tour of the facilities. It examined the ethos of biological engineering and the move towards genetic testing and the power of creation wielded in human hands. Crichton was surprisingly prescient about where genetic testing would go in the years to come (the book was published in 1990). I found his window into the potential horrors of unabated scientific growth to be fascinating and almost more scary than the man-eating dinosaurs tearing up the joint. His warning about pushing scientific growth for financial gain is becoming more and more realized as the years go on. It's true that a lot of the best scientific minds no longer go to work for research universities or the government (which may be worse than the alternative, given your view on government), but to powerful, private companies. As someone who's worked for a private, powerful company, I can tell you that they make it very difficult to see the big picture. You're given a small, detailed task to complete and are rarely told why or what part your task plays in the grand scheme of things. It was disturbingly easy for me to imagine a multi-national corporation bringing back to life the deadliest apex predators to walk on Earth. It's also easy to imagine that the people in charge ignored the nagging questions other people had, like, ""Hey, maybe it's not a good idea to bring back those Velociraptor fellows. They seem mean."" It was also not surprising to me 1. how many people ignored the dangers for the profit margin, 2. how the system was built with few and faulty checks and balances, and 3. how long it took the corporation to abandon the goal in lieu of the...um...eatings.The horror stories that get to me are the ones I can imagine actually happening one day. Some (like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) are more plausible than others (like my irrational fear of the Zombie Apocalypse. Our parents' house is totally ill-equipped to handle that.). I liked Jurassic Park because it took the subject matter very seriously and Crichton researched the heck out of his topic. And it was a helluva beach read.",en

Obviously stuff goes wrong. I have not seen the movie, so naturally I read the book first. I really enjoyed Jurassic Park!I was interested from the beginning. I would have thought with all the science and learning going on that it would have felt pretentious. I'm sort of sensitive when it comes to books feeling pretentious and it irks me, but that was not the case here! Rather than feeling irritated, I was interesting in learning about this world. I don't believe all the science is actually true (and as much is mentioned in the back of the book) but it was still very fun to read as well as got me interested to learn about things now. I've never cared about Dinosaurs but this book may have changed that.The characters mostly felt real and fun to read about. Lex, an 8 year old girl, was rather annoying and at times didn't feel like an actual kid to me but that could have just been me. She didn't feel older, it was more like she was constantly a brat and in the face of danger no less. Also she didn't get to eat for a long time (because things) and when food was within reach, despite being starving for quite awhile, she was still picky and bratty about it. Girl, obviously you ain't as hungry as you claim then...insisting on non-existent Ice cream.What gets me about her is in relation to her 10 year old brother Tim who was apparently very smart and responsible, while his 8 year old sister was an unbelievable brat, annoying and putting them in danger, but Tim, the barely older boy, was amazing and helped save the day. Yeah..that kinda irked me. At the same time what do I know? They are kids and people are different and how does one know how people would react to seeing live dinosaurs anyway, it's fiction.That makes it sound like I was more irked than I actually was. For the most part I loved everything about this book! I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happened next. It was also thought-provoking at times and had me think about things. The pacing was steady, it was readable, fun, exciting, and thought-provoking. I have to watch the movie!It can be read as a stand-alone and if I heard correctly was originally ment to be a stand-alone, but he was pressured by the movie people and fans to create a sequel, The Lost World. I am interested to know what happens next and hope to get to it someday.Actual Rating: 4 stars",en
1073,526270,1342560044,really liked it,"My one and only claim to fame is that I worked in the same bio lab that Michael Crichton spent his post-doctoral fellowship. My lab had beautiful views of the cliffs of Black's Beach and the Pacific beyond it. He was said to have chosen the loneliest bench at the back of the lab.This was a pretty quick read. I had fun figuring out what was wrong with the population graph before Ian Malcolm got to it and I was pretty chuffed when I was right. I liked the book because it was fun but I had problems with some of the larger philosophical points.I was disappointed that Malcolm was only used as mouthpiece for Crichton's mistrust of science (I don't know enough about Crichton to know if that is true), and that Jurassic Park was his straw man for him to point to and say, ""See! Don't trust these people!"". So many improbable things had to converge to let these sequence of events unfold. I'm pretty sure InGen would have gone bankrupt before Wu could find all the right places to splice the dinosaurs DNA with the correct genes from the amphibian DNA such that the dinosaurs could A) change sex and B) breed. I suspended my disbelief once for dinosaurs, but this was too much.I was in disbelief when Dennis Nedry said that the animal count was really just ""Enter a number of animals you think there are and we'll count up to that. It makes the count go faster"". Who would do that?I couldn't help but compare the book to the movie and I'm glad it covered some of Nedry's motivations and Hammond's dislike of Ian. Overall, I appreciated the more graphic descriptions in the book that got lost in translation in the movie.I spoiled the ending for myself by having read the Lost World before this one, but this was still worth the read given that the movie and the book don't line up 100% to give the sequel enough context about what originally happened.",en

1080,526270,2033813231,it was amazing,"The jaw dropping visual effects of the first Jurassic Park movie are still fresh on my mind. Watching creatures long extinct coming back to life and then running amok in an island built specifically to contain them was immensely exciting to a young boy. It took a couple of years for the dinosaurs in my brain to temporarily vanish along with some of the other images of childhood. The feel of nostalgia was so strong when I watched the T-Rex coming out of the paddock in Jurassic World that I almost leapt out of my seat at the theatre !Then again there was the book written by Crichton which was one of the first few ‘grown-up’ novels that I read and not surprisingly , I could barely understand a thing. The whole points on Malcolm and his chaos theory, the science behind the dinosaurs and the technical aspects of the park were all the totally uninteresting bits and I sank my teeth quite greedily on the bits on the dino rampage. I read again and again the parts I loved until they became almost imprinted on my mind. The reading experience though was by no means complete and having read this book cover-to-cover now I do realize that my notions about the whole concept of Jurassic Park were rather misplaced.What lies beneath the awe inspiring façade of Jurassic Park is quite simply a faulty system with an even faultier failsafe. The dinosaur cloning methods are quite impressive and yet the brains behind the theme park have little or no clue as to the behavior of the animals themselves. It really doesn’t appear prudent to bring to life one of the world’s largest land based predators and then observe it for how it would behave around human beings who are potentially prey. At the onset the security systems are shown to be rather impregnable and slowly chapter by chapter they all come undone. Dennis Nedry, the rogue programmer is however only the domino that sets the whole chain in motion. A mix of complacency, inefficiency and bafflement leads to utter chaos at the command center of the park. The version of John Hammond from the movie was a kindly old man who reminds of you of a slightly eccentric granddad but the Hammond that Crichton envisioned was a prick and a rich one at that. The kind of rich man who throws money and people at problems and expects them to go away and if they don’t then yell, coax, cajole, threaten or mollycoddle the problems out of existence. The kind of rich man who through the force of character goes up the ranks and stumbles somewhere along the way. The influence of Hammond over the scientists and the technicians have a huge and influential part to play at the overall downfall of the park. The vision of the park is all his and it is a stroke of genius and yet his habit of pushing others, even the children onto this highly risky enterprise does not speak too highly of his skills as a humane person. The animals are pretty much the most famous part of Jurassic Park by now and yet I had this thought as to whether this whole story could be transplanted elsewhere. Could the T-Rex be replaced by a Bengal/Siberian Tiger or a pride of Lions ? Could the Velociraptors be replaced by a pack of Wolves ? The story would still be a taut thriller and yet the whole sense of dread might be diminished there for these are animals we know. The years we have spent with them on this planet have given us an indication as to how they might behave at certain instances. How can you apply these rules to an animal who no human being has ever seen before and is almost as big as a building ? The best you can do is to cobble together some approximations on animal behavior and hope that the enclosures hold them. Crichton scores big when dealing with the rampaging T-Rex and the fiercely intelligent raptors. The science of what the dinosaurs really were is skewed and almost twisted out of shape while a fantastic thriller is delivered for the readers ! Jurassic Park to me is one of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time. There are no two ways about it.",en

JURASSIC PARKSebuah maha karya dari sang master penulis genre sci-fi, MICHAEL CRICHTON!Film adaptasinya yang oke banget disutradai sama Steven Spielberg pada tahun 1993 itu adalah salah satu film yang memorable jaman saya waktu SD!Setelah melanglangbuana lama sekali saking langkanya, sampai akhirnya menemukan ini buku terjemahan terbitan GPU @gramediabooks cetakan pertama tahun 1997, langsung semangat baca! Filmnya aja seru banget, apalagi bukunya!Langsung aja saya mau cerita sekilas tentang kisah Taman Jurassic ini. Gak bakal spoiler kok, cuma teaser, teasing atau menggoda orang itu menyenangkan :pJadi ada sebuah perusahaan yang sangat ambisius, namanya International Genetic Technologies, Inc., atau biasa disebut InGen, yang di saat kemajuan bioteknologi berhasil melampaui rival-rival lembaga penelitian genetika komersil. Kegiatan riset diam-diam mereka di daerah paling terpencil di Amerika Tengah, menjadi insiden besar yang dari kedua puluh orang yang terlibat dan menjadi saksi mata, hanya segelintir yang selamat.Bisa ditebak dari judulnya, genetika apa yang mereka kembangkan risetnya? Dinosaurus!John Hammond, seorang kakek tajir dan berpengaruh, punya impian sangat besar, ambisius, serta persuasif, juga super percaya diri. Dia otak di belakang segala ide tak terbayangkan Jurassic Park Project nya InGen. Dengan kemampuannya, dia menggalang banyak sponsor, mengumpulkan ahli-ahli di bidang genetika, paleontologi, herbologi, dan taman hiburan dan kebun binatang, menggelontorkan banyak uang untuk proyek tersebut. Semua demi membangun taman hiburan sekaligus kebun binatang makhluk purbakala yang tidak mungkin pihak lain bayangkan akan terwujud. Pastinya akan jadi proyek dengan biaya besar yang akan memberikan pemasukan yang jauh lebih besar lagi di masa depan.Tapi coba bayangkan, makhluk purba yang adikuasa di zamannya mereka coba hidupkan lagi di zaman sekarang? Di satu pulau besar dengan segala teknologi elektronik dan programming yang sangat mumpuni, bahkan dalam pembangunan DNA para spesies Dinosaurus itu pun telah mereka manipulasi agar dapat mereka kontrol dan monitoring untuk mencegah adanya kemungkinan terburuk. Well, mungkin dengan teknologi yang mereka punya sekarang itu memungkinkan... Jika semua berjalan sesuai rencana sih.. hahahaha! *evilLaughKetika proyek Jurassic Park ini sudah hampir jadi, dalam hitungan bulan akan segera dibuka sesuai rencana. John Hammond mengundang para konsultannya untuk melakukan wisata awal disana, pulau Isla Nublar di perairan terpencil Costa Rica.Berkumpullah para ahli tersebut disana, mereka semua sesungguhnya tidak tahu menahu akan proyek yang sedang dibuat oleh InGen Inc.. Mereka hanya tahu mereka dibayar mahal oleh InGen untuk menjawab dan memberi laporan tentang apa saja yang mereka butuhkan. Semisal, sang programmer diminta untuk membuat program untuk kalkulasi otomatis berdasarkan sensor area tertentu, sang paleontologi diminta untuk menjawab pertanyaan kebiasaan dinosaurus tertentu pada zaman dahulu berdasarkan referensi penggalian, dan seperti itu juga untuk yang lainnya. Hanya fokus menjawab apa yang diperlukan InGen.Lalu seorang profesor matematika yang nyetrik bak seorang rocker dan jenius, ialah Ian Malcom. Dia salah satu penasihat yang disewa John Hammond untuk kalkulasi-kalkulasi briliannya. Ian Malcom sangat pesimis dengan proyek milik Hammond ini. Dengan Chaos Theory nya, dia menjelaskan hal-hal yang akan terjadi dan dia yakin pasti terjadi di Jurassic Park ini.Dan iya tepat sekali, dugaan Ian Malcom terbukti, Tur Impian ini menjadi mimpi buruk bagi semua kru dan rombongan tur!Sungguh piawai sekali Michael Chricton dalam menulis plot kisah sekaligus mencampurkan penjelasan ilmiah yang sedang diangkat tanpa merusak suasana yang sedang terjadi. Kita dibawa dalam argumen ilmiah yang cukup jelas meskipun sesungguhnya itu rumit.Seperti ketika Ian Malcolm atau Dr. Wu menjelaskan dengan rumit layaknya ilmuwan dalam forum ilmiah, pasti ada karakter yang menyela dan meminta penjelasan dengan lebih sederhana haha! Kekaguman saya ketika Dr. Alan Grant dengan pengetahuannya pada bidang Paleontologi yang sesungguhnya bersifat dugaan (karena ya binatangnya gak ada uwoy, tulang doang yang diteliti) bisa membantu rekan-rekannya untuk bertahan hidup dengan cerdas.Lalu emosi kita juga dibawa naik dan turun, saya sering sekali ikut menahan nafas bahkan ikutan teriak hahaha! Seperti ketika Dr. Grant, Tim, dan Lex tak sengaja menginjak ranting dengan suara nyaring ketika menyaksikan dalam diam dan waspada penuh kengerian dari atas bukit saat salah satu rekan mereka dipermainkan oleh bayi T-Rex di dasar bukit, dan seketika bayi T-Rex itu langsung mengalihkan cepat kepalanya ke atas bukit, arah mereka (spoiler dikit :p)Saya juga beberapa kali meringis ngilu ketika ada karakter yang proses kematiannya dideskripsikan dengan indah dan mengerikan oleh dinosaurus. Aaaaaa~ Iiiiihhh~ gitu....Buat yang udah nonton filmnya pasti udah tau juga dong ceritanya. Filmnya nyaris persis sama bukunya, jadi waktu saya baca ini buku ya sebenernya udah tau garis besar ceritanya. Tapi itu ga mengurangi tingkat kekerenan buku ini. Banyak hal2 yang seperti adaptasi lainnya, pastinya jauh lebih detail di buku. Ada juga yang justru di film dihilangkan detailnya atau malah diubah sama sekali berbeda dengan bukunya. Untuk kasus Film dan Buku Jurassic Park ini saya puas dengan keduanya hahaha! Both of book and movie is really awesome! MUST READ BOOK AND MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR SCi-FI THRILLER LOVER!Jadi pengen kasitau 3 poin yang jadi perbedaan besar antara buku dan film nya :1. Adanya gender switch buat karakter para cucu John Hammond, Tim dan Lex. Tim di buku itu cowo, Lex itu cewe. Entah kenapa sama Steven Spielberg gendernya dibalik. Tapi justru itu makin bikin cerita mereka berdua di film lebih ngena sih, terutama bagian petak umpet sama trio Velociraptor di dapur! Sangat memorable!2. Bagian Prolog buku ga ada di film yang pertama, melainkan prolog film yang kedua.3. Ending filmnya inget ga? cukup happy ending ya? ga juga sih.. tapi ending aslinya dibuku itu BEDA BANGET! SAMPE SAYA SIYOK! HAHAHAHA! MAU TAU? BACA AJA! SUSAH LOH CARI BUKU TERJEMAHAN ATAU FISIK INGGRISNYA. KUDU EBOOK! :))))) *puas banget ya saya. bodo amat :v

Review originally posted on Reading is My Kind of Thing
After a series of strange animal attacks on the (fictional) island of Isla Nublar, paleontologist Alan Grant and his paleobotanist graduate student, Ellie Sattler, are contracted to confirm the identification of the species. But before they can, they are whisked away by billionaire John Hammond for a weekend visit to a “biological preserve” he has established on Isla Nublar, which is revealed to be Jurassic Park on arrival – a theme park showcasing cloned dinosaurs.I first picked up Jurassic Park in 2015, expecting it to be just like the movie. Within 50 pages I ended up DNFing the book, feeling disappointing in myself for not enjoying the source material of one of my favourite movies of all time. But after successfully finishing (and ENJOYING) the audiobook this year, I’ve realised that’s the biggest mistake anyone can make when going into this book.With the second instalment in the Jurassic World trilogy looming, I was reminded of where the franchise began. Being a more experienced reader I went in with little expectations and decided to try the audiobook copy my library had. From my previous experience I remember there being a bit of science lingo that I wasn’t fond of, I was hoping the audiobook would make it easier to bear. I can confirm that it definitely makes it easier to bear!After successfully finishing this audiobook, I’ve realised the biggest mistake any reader can make going into this book is definitely going to be any expectations they have of it.. Especially if you’re a massive fans of the film adaptation. They’re not too dissimilar and if you’re familiar with the movie you’ll be able to see where Spielberg got his inspiration from. Yet, the storyline of the book takes a different route than the movie, one that is still quite adventurous.Personally, I know I wouldn’t have enjoy reading Jurassic Park compared with the listening experience. Firstly, there’s A LOT of set up. (This is prevalent in the movie too, but more enjoyable on that medium.) I was honestly yawning my way through roughly the first 35% of this audiobook. The scientific lingo doesn’t help, BUT the audiobook makes it much more bearable to get through. I’d compare it to watching your uni lectures instead of trying to decipher the textbook yourself.However, that set up is completely worth what follows. Which brings me to my second point: the added value the audiobook brings. This is largely due to the excellent narration by Scott Brick. You can literally feel the tension in the story because of the narration. This is because Brick really accentuates when characters are being too loud or when characters are speaking in hushed voices because dinosaurs are on the loose. It may seem insignificant, but I think that attention to detail gave the novel so much tension. Consequently I was on the edge of my seat for so much of this adventure.Aside from the incredibly boring set up, was that the female characters kind of feel non-existent in this book. I love Ellie Sattler, but I wanted more of her! And aside from Ellie, the only other female character is Lexie, the most annoying child in a book I’ve read ever.Ultimately, if you’re considering picking up this book, I’d highly recommend the audiobook. This was such a fun adventure filled with tension (and some gore) at every turn.",en

Sorry guys, but Ali has been replaced with a 12-year-old boy again (this happened when I confessed my love and obsession for 
Ready Player One
). I have FINALLY read Jurassic Park (right? WTH is wrong with me? Why did it take me so long?), and my god I was obsessed with it.What I loved about Jurassic Park (other than everything):
It's SO MUCH BETTER than the movie. Mostly because it's longer and has more fantastic details about all things dinosaur. 
   In fact, if you're super into the movie, I'd recommend listening to the audiobook. It's basically like listening to a 15-hour movie, and who doesn't want that? The narrator, Scott Brick, could not have been better. 
   There are so many more fantastically eerie scenes with the Tyrannosaur, I was OMG-ing on my drive to work almost every day. 
   The ending with Dr. Hammond is different, and I think it's way better. In fact, it's perfect. 
   This book is legit action-packed and fast-paced. There is not a slow moment in this book. AT ALL. (And I listened to the audiobook, so that's saying something.) 
  

You need to read this book if: 1) You liked the movie, 2) You like dinosaurs even a little bit, and/or 3) you also have a 12-year-old boy that occupies a part of your soul. 

So now that I've read Jurassic Park, I obviously need to move on to The Lost World. From there I'll be jumping into other Michael Crichton books, because something tells me I'm going to be obsessed with all of them. Have you read Jurassic Park or other books by Michael Crichton? What were your thoughts?

1087,526270,1199920398,really liked it,"Review en español en mi blog: Click acáI loved the Jurassic Park movie as a child but I didn't know it was based on a novel until I searched it on Goodreads. Needless to say that the book was better: a lot of awesome scenes weren't adapted to the film (or recycled and used later on Jurassic Park III) and the secondary characters have important roles on the story, unlike the movie where their only purpose is to be eaten by the dinosaurs.Another strong point of this novel was the amount of research made by the author: we find a lot of information about the behavior of dinosaurs as well as genetic engineering and computer coding. Of course that Crichton takes some creative licences (like the existence of poison spitting dinosaurs, for example) but these didn't bother me at all.The main characters are really different from their film counterparts as well: Ian Malcolm was far more interesting than in the movie (because I hate Jeff Goldblum), the children have more importance in the story and Hammond (the park owner) is madder than in the movie, he was an asshole actually.The ending is different from the one shown in the movie too and it was excellent in my opinion because it resumed the idea of the whole novel, I was pleasantly surprised by it and made me want to read the sequel as soon as possible. So if you loved the Jurassic Park film and even if you hated it, I totally recommend this book. It's more complex than the movie adaptation and superior in all aspects.

Y por wendy entiéndase cuco, suspenso, neurosis, palabrotas. ¡Estamos hablando de velociraptores y tiranosaurios sueltos en una isla con gente indefensa! Lo que más me gustó es que Crichton creó un mundo que no está para nada lejos de -algún día- convertirse en realidad. Solo necesitas gente con MUCHA plata, ambición y un poco de suerte. Ian Malcolm, lejos, el mejor personaje de todos (a Dr. Grant lo encontré un tanto insulso). Se mandó varios ""speeches"" dignos de la Permacultura y del libro ""Cómo ser libre"" que leí hace unas semanas atrás. Reproduciré acá un extracto:""What advances?' Malcolm said irritably. 'The number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since 1930, despite all the advances. All the vacuum cleaners, washer-dryers, trash compactors, garbage disposals, wash-and-wear fabrics… Why does it still take as long to clean the house as it did in 1930? -Ellis said nothing. 'Because there haven't been any advances,' Malcolm said. 'Not really. Thirty thousand years ago, when men were doing cave paintings at Lascaux, they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing. The rest of the time, they could play, or sleep, or do whatever they wanted. And they lived in a natural world, with clean air, clean water, beautiful trees and sunsets. Think about it. Twenty hours a week. Thirty thousand years ago"".Me pasó, al igual que con Forrest Gump (W. Grrom), que me gustó más la versión cinematográfica. 3 estrellas para el libro, 5 para el film",en
1089,526270,875913968,it was ok,"All I've ever heard about Jurassic Park is how much better the book is than the movie. I'm not really sure I understand why people say this.And I didn't just like the book (a lot) less than the movie because of the differences (like how Grant actually likes kids, how certain characters die and others live, how insufferable Malcolm is in the book, how they used Gillette instead of Barbasol). It just felt so drawn out, unnecessarily technical, even kind of confusing. The book could have easily been 150 pages (and a dozen T-Rex encounters) shorter.Going into this book, I didn't think there was a single character in movies or books that I liked less than Jurassic movie grandson Tim. He was a complainer and a non-listener, and a general nuisance. I guess I should thank Steven Spielberg for toning down the version of the character in the book. In the book, Lex is the annoying one, and Michael Crichton takes every opportunity to remind you how awful she is. Whether she's complaining that she's hungry, not listening to Grant, yelling at Tim, complaining that she's hungry, grabbing things she shouldn't grab, or complaining that she's hungry, she has to be the most overly obnoxious character I've ever read. I was wishing for an 8-year-old girl to get her intestines ripped out by a velociraptor, and I was oddly okay with it.In his closing thoughts, John Hammond said it best: ""He should never have brought those kids. They had been nothing but trouble from the beginning. Nobody wanted them around.""",en

However, this is the first time I've ever opened this book.. so.. yeah, I suck as a reader and a person.

If that doesn't already scream ""TERRIBLE FUCKING IDEA"" then..yeah, I don't know what else would scream that. Maybe add some flair for disaster?? Of course crazy people want to see these dinosaurs because who wouldn't? We weren't alive back when they were! Now that they are here and we only have to pay a small fortune to travel to our deaths.I loved the movies so of course I knew that this book was going to be a favorite. Okay, I was hoping and praying that it would! The beginning was entertaining, interesting, and obviously got me hooked. Just like the movies did! The characters were either lovable or needed a punch to the face.Lex was probably more annoying to me in the books than the girl was in the movies. I wanted to strangle her every time she annoyed the shit out of me. Then there's Tim who was basically the saving grace and probably the favorite of that family.

1092,526270,1751719819,really liked it,"Always great to revisit a childhood classic. I watched the movie long before I knew the book or even the author existed. But since I discovered Crichton, I've made a habit of re-reading this 'classic' every few years.Mind you, it's not a literary classic, far from it, but there are two important things in this book. One, it tells you how humans can be clever enough to raise the dead. Our technological advances are ahead of what science fiction would've imagined maybe 100 years ago.Two, how human greed can destroy everything.But, the bottomline is that there are dinosaurs.

1099,526270,23509499,really liked it,"	“Jurassic Park” was my first Michael Crichton book. I had heard somewhere that he was a writer like Tom Clancy who would spend pages and pages dwelling on technical details while neglecting the story. I went in without expectations.	Crichton is a writer of the best quality. Not only does he weave an interesting story with complicated, relatable characters, he also explains and educates things to the reader in an entertaining way.	The book is a lot like the movie, but many things are different as well. They are both excellent, and each make use of their strengths to tell a story. There are many wonderful things that are in the book that didn’t make it to the movie, and vice versa. The two cannot be compared.	Amid the science, Crichton has planted a true gem of a fantastic story. The idea is very well handled, implications understood and conveyed, and the book even ends of a mystery (thank goodness he wrote a sequel).4.5	Characters	All of the characters in the book felt like living, three-dimensional people. In particular, the character of Ian Malcolm is one of pure genius. I relished every time he spoke. The little girl is so annoying I hoped someone would feed her to the dinosaurs, but provoking that kind of reaction is probably what the writer wanted.4	Pace	“Jurassic Park” is a rollercoaster ride. It’s a pretty big book, but it went by very fast. I was never bored, and Malcolm’s speeches made the book so much more interesting rather than bogging it down.4	Story	To me, modern dinosaurs is an original idea. Crichton’s method of trapping everyone on an island, with few weapons, is clever and interesting. The only thing that I was never really interested in was the subplot/time limit of the velociraptors on the ship heading for the mainland. Also, I did not like the violence directed toward newborn infants in the beginning. Things like that bug me.4.5	Dialogue	All of the dialogue in the book is good and realistic. It is Malcolm’s speeches that win an extra point. They are nothing short of genius, all while illustrating his wonderful character at the same time.4	Style/Technical	I like that Crichton is fearless in printing computer code and output screens in the text of his novel. It is inventive and makes a reader feel as though everything has really happened. He is otherwise clear and concise. I was never confused.4.2	Overall	“Jurassic Park” was amazing to read. The pace was fast, the characters were interesting, and the story was fun. In terms of characters and dialogue though, special attention must be given to Dr. Ian Malcolm. He is a rare character in any fiction, and one of the best and most entertaining I have ever read. I look forward to reading about his continuing exploits in “The Lost World”.",en
1100,526270,1323427919,really liked it,"A park for dinosaurs? Hell yeah.Wait—Something tells me, something important, that it would never work. Huh. Guess I could only stick to book. Jurassic Park, completely wiping out the definition of extinction by re-creating big-arse dinosaurs and sticking them in an unopened park — which in hindsight, is kind of like animal cruelty, even though they no longer exist — and as you can tell from the last four times in the film world, (seriously, do not use dinosaur DNA and bring them back, not unless you want to end up like the guy that gets eaten by a T-Rex), bad stuff happens.A group of scientists are invited to the park, including Dr. Alan Grant, a refreshing, contrasted version of the film palaeontologist, adopting a father-like figure to the owner’s grandchildren. It felt magical to be rewarded with several new scenes during the introduction, including ones of strange ‘lizard’ attacks, questioning what they truly were and adding excitement in spite of knowing the events that would follow. Though a book that focuses heavily on the scientific aspects, something Crichton does well in my non-scientific, over-the-top-of-my-head view, the action and danger and steady fall of scenes made a strong balance between them; what also helped was the attention to detail, and research clearly put into this novel.“Welcome to Jurassic Park.” — Jurassic Park, pg. 93.Recently becoming a fan of the film, seeing this quote — so wonderfully spoken by dear Richard Attenborough, bless his soul — gave me chills, given it was such a memorable thing and said by such a good character; John Hammond, owner of the park, didn’t take any sh–t from anyone, with his stubborn determinacy to keep the park alive, a trait that was admirable for his passion, but a flaw also. He, along with Dr. Ian Malcolm, were what I found to be the key strengths in character, which had nothing to do with the fact I definitely did not envision Jeff Goldblum the whole time, of course. The plot overshadowed the other characters, which probably sounds ridiculous considering it’s about non-existent pre-historic animals which require that much depth. Had there been slightly less science and explaining, but more looking into the character’s lives, then this possibly would’ve been one of my favourite books.Fun, interesting (with the addition of clear indications never to make this a reality), Jurassic Park was a great read; however, compared to the film, in this instance, I’d have to say was the winner.",en
1101,526270,1566114638,really liked it,"Jurassic Park is a huge part of my childhood I loved the film and have watched it countless amounts of times. This is the first time I have managed to read the original novel after a couple of attempts to get into it previously.Now this is another case where the book is different from the film but in equal amount of good ways and bad(aka just like 'The Shining'). I highly recommend watching the film first if you havent already as these two compliment each other very well. Alot of the questions that go unanswered in the book are answered in the film and visa versa.So much about the characters are different in the book no only physically but mentally also, Hammond who is really loveable in the film is a piece of work in the book and the lawyer who was my mosted hated character in the film is a really good guy in the book. The roles of Lex and Tim are also swapped round in the book which to me didnt work as well as it did in the film and I did prefer the film adaptations of those characters, same goes for Ian Malcolm but when The Goldblum is playing a character that is always going to be the best portrial your going to find.Jurassic Park the film is a family horror/sci fi film where as the book is meant for more older readers. It is alot darker and violent, as well as just plain scary in places such as the Raptor Nests. I would really recommend this for horror fans more than anyone else.Crichton did a very good job with research for the book with the information that was available at the time and although to me the sections that go into detail about dinosaurs and their nature is alittle dry some people might enjoy it.I honestly only decided to give this book a full read due to one of Crichton's other creations 'West World' having me hooked at the minute it time and I have to admit I am glad I did. If you enjoyed the film then this is a must read but if you also like horror I would give this a go. Not as good as the film was to me but in my opinion the film a true masterpiece.",en

I was surprised how closely the movie followed the original story. Personally, I felt that the movie was scarier, because prehistoric monsters are scarier to watch than read. Plus, ""jump scenes' work better on screen. I loved the introduction to the novel, which discusses real advancements in genetics that were already occurring in the 1980s. Crichton offered an unsettling warning that fiction like this could potentially turn into reality as scientific advances in cloning and genetic manipulation continue. This book is full of discuss of chaos theory, which I actually really enjoyed. Malcolm is the rock star of matheticians!Overall, this novel is a good mix of adventure and science with a few great, gory dinosaur attacks.

1110,526270,2059729790,it was amazing,"Jurassic park es un libro que me resulta particularmente difícil de reseñar. Quizás porque es una historia con la que estoy muy interiorizado y con la que crecí. Además, este es un libro interesante porque tenemos un autor que se supo lucir en más de un medio. Crichton no solo escribió libros, también fue guionista de cine y televisión siendo uno de los responsables de series como ER y de películas como Westworld o la adaptación de este libro. Quizás es por eso que no puedo mantenerme fiel a mi política de “valorar cada obra por lo que es y no comprarlas con otras”. En este libro visitamos lugares demasiado conocidos para los que amamos las películas de Jurassic park. Irónicamente, estas películas y este libro tienen diferencias notorias y creo que eso es lo que hace buenas a ambas obras.Este libro empieza de una forma extraña. Aquí conocemos a una pequeña familia estadounidense que decidió pasar sus vacaciones en Costa Rica. La hija del matrimonio es una niña curiosa y aventurera, es por eso que decide alejarse de sus padres y eso la mete en problemas cuando es atacada por un lagarto del tamaño de un gato. Estos primeros capítulos son brillantes. Aquí la complicidad autor/lector es notoria, porque nosotros ya sabemos que la niña fue atacada por un pequeño dinosaurio (el título del libro lo delata). Por el otro lado los personajes no tienen idea de este peligro y eso hace que leer las primeras líneas de esta novela sea una experiencia tan atrapante.Tras los primeros capítulos viajamos a un lugar conocido para los que crecimos con las películas. Aquí conocemos al doctor Grant y a su alumna, la doctora Sattler. Estos personajes son dos paleontólogos que están realizando una excavación. La excavación está financiada por un excéntrico millonario que un día sin previo aviso los invita a su nuevo parque de diversiones. John Hammond es un hombre con una visión, gracias a los avances de la tecnología, creó un parque zoológico repleto de animales extintos. El problema de Hammond es que nadie sabe realmente cómo era la vida de los dinosaurios, por lo que necesita juntar a un grupo de expertos para que evalúe el realismo de su parque.Es una vez que están en el parque que la historia realmente comienza y se empiezan a notar las diferencias con la película. Para empezar, el doctor Grant es un hombre amable y bueno con los niños, por el otro lado en el cine lo vemos como un hombre que detesta a los niños. Además, los nietos de Hammond tienen las personalidades cambiadas en la película. Esto es algo que me hizo reír cuando leía el libro porque no me esperaba esas reacciones de los niños. De todas formas, la parte más importante en la que el libro difiere de la película es el enfoque. Por un lado la película busca mostrar efectos especiales y escenas de acción, el libro nos plantea una pregunta más filosófica.Hoy en día tenemos una tecnología que crece sin límites. Tenemos la capacidad de enviar satélites a otros planetas, crear bombas que destruyen ciudades y redes de inteligencia que espíen a un país entero. Yo estoy convencido de que si pudiéramos conseguir ADN de especies extintas también podríamos clonarlas y crear un parque como el de esta novela. La pregunta que debemos hacernos es ¿debemos hacerlo? La tecnología llegó a un punto en el que podemos crear cosas impresionantes, en palabras del doctor Hammond podemos jugar a ser Dios. Lo que nos demuestra este libro que es capacidad y deber son dos cosas totalmente diferentes. Por más que tengamos la tecnología no siempre debemos usar esos conocimientos, hay algunas cosas que no dependen de los seres humanos y quizás no debamos jugar con ellas.Jurassic Park es un libro que nos da personajes carismáticos, escenas divertidas y una trama interesante. Pero lo más importante es que nos demuestra la naturaleza humana. Aquí los científicos quieren crear vida, las empresas corruptas quieren robar información para boicotear a sus competidores, los niños quieren divertirse, y los dinosaurios quieren vivir libres. Tenemos una novela en la que el mensaje es fuerte y claro, no se le puede poner límites a la vida y nosotros no debemos meter mano donde no nos llaman.Como ningún libro es perfecto, creo que también hay que reconocer los errores del autor a la hora de mostrarnos los personajes. Por una extraña razón me da la sensación de que todos los personajes secundarios (menos Malcom el matemático) son estúpidos. Por más divertido que sea un zoológico, por más novedosa que sea una atracción o por más lindos que sean los dinosaurios, parecen haberse olvidado de que están tratando con animales vivos. Los encargados de Jurassic Park pensaron que al revivir a los depredadores más peligrosos que caminaron por la tierra, no iban a tener que pensar en complejas medidas de seguridad. Los visitantes demoran demasiado en darse cuenta que muchos de los dinosaurios son asesinos a sangre fría. Por último Hammond es un hombre tan cegado por el capitalismo que no está dispuesto a escuchar a nadie que le muestre las fallas evidentes de su plan.Capítulo aparte, tengo que hacer una pausa para hablarles de las “capturas de pantalla” de este libro. Crichton se tomó el trabajo de mostrarnos todas las tablas y menús que los personajes ven en las computadoras del libro. En un principio. esto puede parecer algo accesorio pero cuando te compenetras con la lectura y empiezas a pasar los ojos por esas tablas. Te das cuenta que estás actuando como un personaje más de la historia y esto me parece una movida fantástica por parte del autor.Rápido, inteligente y atrapante, este es un libro que no los va a desilusionar. Creo que Jurassic Park es uno de esos libros que todo el mundo debe leer. Las preguntas que se plantean en sus páginas son cada vez más actuales. En 1990 se había empezado a hablar de clonación y del ADN como algo más teórico que práctico. Hoy en día tenemos la tecnología para pasar a la práctica y va a depender de nuestra generación el cómo usamos esos avances. Libro super recomendado.Más reviews en: www.diariodefriki.com",es
1111,526270,1360788100,it was ok,"Attention : ce n'est pas la première fois qu'Hollywood vous fait voir les choses plus reluisantes qu'elles ne le sont réellement. Jurassic Park n'est pas une exception : le roman à l'origine de l'adaptation ciné par Spielberg avait, sur le papier, tout pour plaire - un pitch qui tue, des dinosaures, une île, des situations dangereuses, des dinosaures, des personnages intelligents, de l'action et des dinosaures, de bonnes critiques en général de la part de mes contacts sur Goodreads et des dinosaures - tous les ingrédients pour faire un bon livre d'aventures, d'action, voire un bon thriller scientifique. Oui, mais la mayonnaise ne prend pas. Je ne vais pas parler de style ou de profondeur des personnages parce que ce serait ridicule : ce n'est pas ce qu'on attend de ce genre d'ouvrage. On veut frissonner, boudiou, et se rappeler des nuggets en forme de T-rex qu'on mangeait quand on était gamins !Mais le problème, malgré tout, c'est que la narration est tellement mal menée (et malmenée) que la lecture de Jurassic Park s'avère très laborieuse. Les cent premières pages, déjà : sautez-les. On n'apprend rien, c'est du blabla autour des personnages, pour dire à quel point ils sont cools ou à quel point ils sont méchants. L'action ne commence vraiment qu'à partir de la page 200. Pour un livre de 500 pages, c'est très long. Les personnages, ensuite, n'ont aucune logique : il y a une différence entre un personnage construit de manière superficielle, et un personnage en carton pâte. Les derniers ne tiennent tout simplement pas debout. Hammond, par exemple, le créateur de l'île, fait venir ses petits-enfants : très bien. Ensuite, les petits-enfants disparaissent, pendant que Papy continue à jouer au Monopoly dans l'hôtel, en parlant money money money et sans jamais évoquer le sort de Tim et d'Alex. In extremis, on apprend qu'en fait il les déteste - ah bon, très bien. Les personnages agissent également sans la moindre logique : comment ? Un nid de raptors, les mêmes dinosaures qui ont défoncé la moitié de mes potes pendant déjà cent pages ? Oui oui, laissez-moi y aller, je veux compter les œufs, tranquillou pilou, et rien ne va se passer.Comment ? Une île dans laquelle les dinosaures ont déjà tué trois personnes, et sérieusement blessé des dizaines d'autres, et ce dès les prémisses du roman ? Faire venir un médecin, mais pourquoi ? Avoir des munitions, pour se défendre ? Comment ? Même le tyrannosaure n'est pas logique : ""la tête du tyrannosaure apparût derrière un arbre, derrière une cascade, derrière une maison, derrière... Il était énorme, et moche, et il sentait le vomis..."" - mais fais quelque chose, attaque, bouffe les, au lieu de les suivre comme une andouille ! Rhaaa.Sérieusement... Si seulement l'intrigue avait tenu debout. Les personnages ont donc les caractéristiques émotionnelles et psychologiques des Playmobil - le seul qui sort vaguement du lot est le personnage de Ian Malcolm, le mathématicien, avec sa théorie du chaos. Le problème de personnages creux sur 500 pages, c'est qu'irrémédiablement, ils vont toujours, encore et toujours, répéter exactement la même chose. Parce qu'ils n'ont rien d'autre à dire. Et c'est pénible. C'est très pénible. ""Oui la théorie du chaos blablabla"" - aaaah nooon pas encore !Et l'auteur devait être abonné à Sciences et découvertes, parce que les développements pseudo scientifiques - et datés -, bonjour ! Si seulement j'arrivais à retenir les chiffres qu'il balance en masse, peut-être que j'arriverais un jour à gagner au quizz du pub d'à côté. (Au fait, vous savez que selon une hypothèse d'une équipe de paléontologues ayant travaillé sur des fossiles en Espagne, les tyrannosaures auraient pu nager ? Je l'ai exhumé sur National Geographic, un article de 2007. En tout cas, un tyrannosaure qui nage, en battant l'eau avec ses petites pattes, à la poursuite d'un canot pneumatique, c'est pas la scène d'action la plus sexy que vous auriez pu imaginer).Petite digression : avez-vous déjà vu un livre raciste et sexiste, qui s'ignore tellement qu'il va jusqu'à dénoncer bien platement le racisme et le sexisme ? Vous en avez un juste devant les yeux. Une vingtaine de personnages masculins, pour deux personnages féminins : Ellie, la ""paléontologiste"" (comme l'écrivent gracieusement les traducteurs Pocket - alors que chez moi, on dit une paléontologue, mais bon), a un rôle parfaitement secondaire dans l'intrigue. En fait, alors que son collègue est en train de se battre et de sauver des enfants, elle soigne quelqu'un, parce qu'elle est douce et gentille. Elle a une seule scène d'action, et elle échoue. L'autre ""paléontologiste"" demande son aide par radio dans la scène du labo des œufs, et elle échoue encore. Heureusement qu'Ellie a un short et des longues jambes, qu'on va pouvoir beaucoup décrire - que dire d'autre ?Je ne parle même pas du personnage de Lex, la jeune soeur de Tim, qui est littéralement un boulet, et un personnage inconséquent (quelle petite fille, lors d'une attaque de T rex, va commenter ""J'ai faim ?"" Pourtant c'est quand même le genre d'événement qui coupe l'appétit, en temps normal). Elle parle pour ne rien dire, elle dit des conneries tout du long, elle fait des conneries tout du long : bref, une nana, hein ? Malgré tout, le romancier prend son courage à deux mains, et dénonce bravement la misogynie quotidienne avec des interventions de certains personnages tout à fait artificielles, type : ""Oh, mais vous êtes une femme ?""Même problème pour le racisme : comme à Hollywood, les Noirs et les ouvriers latinos meurent d'abord. Mais c'est aussi comme ça qu'ils sont désignés : ""un Noir s'approcha de la barrière"". Je n'ai plus qu'à supposer que le reste des personnages était des blancs, puisqu'on ne me les a pas présentés en évoquant leur couleur de peau. Ah, et Pocket, encore une fois, merci pour la traduction approximative sans relecture : les informaticiens examinent l'ordinateur piégé par le traitre, et se rendent compte qu'il a été manipulé... Ils s'exclament soudain : ""C'est une trappe !"" Non, ce n'est pas une trappe, c'est un piège - ""it's a trap"" - et une erreur de débutant. ET ON DIT PALÉONTOLOGUE LE PLUS SOUVENT.En essayant de positiver : quelques belles scènes, qui n'ont pas été reprises dans le film parce qu'elles ne devaient pas avoir assez d'impact cinématographique (en même temps, les mauvaises scènes n'ont pas non plus été reprises, Spielberg a beaucoup changé). Notamment, la scène des œufs dans le labo, ou la scène de la cuisine.Spielberg avait bien dû repérer que, si les ingrédients sont là, la forme n'y est pas. C'est pourquoi les inconditionnels du film auraient malgré tout intérêt à lire le roman : ils y découvriront des situations nouvelles et intéressantes. Mais personnellement, je me suis ennuyée ferme.",fr

I expected it to be a little different, all movies based on books always leave out some details but they ended up changing a lot of the story. On to my review of the actual book, I really enjoyed this story and it kept me on my toes the majority of the time and I felt like the dinosaurs came to life before my very eyes. Also I disliked Ian Malcolm’s character, there were PAGES of him rambling on about chaos theory and other very boring things that I thought could of been left out for a more enjoyable read.",en

1115,526270,966528927,did not like it,"I can say it is somewhat entertaining, and I found it better (in some parts) than the film, but it seems to be less about a dinossaur park and more to ""prove"" that humanity is too puny to hurt the planet in a general sense (life will also find a way despite pollution and so on) and that chaos theory scientists are the only ones dealing with real-life science whereas the rest are just money/fame-hyenas.*********There are some minor SPOILERS ahead*************I found myself simply skipping the lengthy paragraphs which went on about chaos theory, why Malcolm calculated the Park was going to fail and moral diatribes against scientists and western society (not to say they are completely off, quite the contrary, but self-righteous speeches serve very poorly their intended purpose). Actually, I found one engineer's position (against Malcolm) to be very enlightening - all life systems (as well as nature) are unstable, so the park can fail as much as any other unstable system (assume human society, zoos, etc.) It made much more sense to me, as the author obviously went to great lengths to create a perfect storm of stupidity and flaws to prove his moral character (Malcolm) right.The book left me with some questions, though, so I'll put some of them here:Q1) Why were an 8-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy in this at all? Q1.1) Were the grown-ups really that daft that they couldn't do what the boy did - read what was on the computer screen using their logic and knowledge to go through menus until they found what they needed? Q1.2) Was the girl there to immitate her mother's more annoying habits, to openly humiliate her brother (until he ends up proving his worth), or to make readers think 8-year-olds are strange things that go into shock after being attacked by a big dinossaur and then act like they want to have fun (Weee! the boat is going really fast! Go faster, go faster!) or become obsessed with ice-cream after having been chased by dinossaurs and being left alone, in the dark, with the possibility of more attacks?Q1.3) And why does the boy's POV seem to suffer from a confusion over the adults when he meets them plus a usage of very simple sentences (with big words mixed in to show off his overtly mature intellect)? Not to mention an 11-year-old referring to a college guy as a ""kid""...Q2) How come raptors are almost superhuman on one hand, chewing through bars of steel and managing complex hunting strategies, and then...Q2.1) ...one is tricked by a little boy into a fridge and gets locked in after a little girl manages a little pin into its lock?Q2.2) ...a whole bunch of raptors, devoted babysitting ""parents"" on top of it, are peacefully oblivious to three people tumbling down on their secret nesting grounds but quickly pick up the sound of boats almost a mile away?",en

I remember that i really liked the movie (it's dinosaurs, we all love dinos) and i even know i saw the 2 movies that came after this at some point on tape, but i only remembered the basic premise, and all of the movies get jumbled in my head. What i take away from the movie experience is an amazing soundtrack and some cool dinosaur footage. But i never read the book. I realized this and decided to fix that. Because i don't remember any specifics about the movie, i didn't experience the same oh this person died who didn't and vice versa that some other people got when they read the book. I dont remember the characters. I thought the girl was older in the movie than the book, but maybe that's just me remembering a later movie. I loved the book! The thought of these people, trapped on an island with dinosaurs was conveyed so well that i felt the kind of resigned horror that if i were there, it would be unlikely i'd make out a alive. i dont remember having such a definite feeling of the scariness when i saw the movie, but that was only less than 2 hrs and i was a kid. The suspense builds and i could imagine myself in their place. Plus, just the whole concept of cloning dinosaurs, and thinking about what that means... these aren't something we brought back in a time travel machine, they're not the same ancient dinos that walked the earth, they're new, and this is their time, even if they're not really adapted to it. it was just interesting to think about. i love crichton's books. if you have only seen the movie, and not read this book, do it!

However, I do think this is one of the rare cases where the movie is better than the book - simply because of the visual aspect of things. That movie was groundbreaking when it came out. It's one thing to read about the T-Rex attack during the park tour, it's another thing entirely to hear the ""thump"" of her feet, to see the water in the puddle vibrating, to see this huge dinosaur roaring. Without the movie, I would never have been able to really see (in my mind) the different dinosaurs that were described in the book. I did really like getting to know the backstories and motivations for the park employees. They're mostly just ""redshirts"" in the movie, they have a bigger story in the book.Edit - forgot to say one thing that really bugged me is that no one had flashlights when they power went off. That's really difficult to believe that this multibillion dollar complex didn't have any flashlights.So - it's a good book. I'm a fan of Crichton, but if you've seen the movie you can safely skip the book. There are only minor differences between the two.",en

1129,526270,2367630478,it was amazing,"Honestly, I feel personally offended that no one ever told me what an amazing book this is. I felt the same way I felt when I read Dracula for the first time... it's impossible not to think about what an unparalleled experience it would be to read it when it was first released-- before all the movies and merchandise and the explosion of a genre and themes. With no prior knowledge of this world and what to expect as the story progresses. But even with all that knowledge, this book is seriously such a treat. I have such a deep appreciation for patient writers, and Crichton is a stellar example of that. He takes his time introducing each character in turn, setting up the exposition, dropping the hints of foreshadowing, piecing together his storylines and POVs. This story works like a finely tuned clock: each tiny cog turns the cog next to it and so the wheels all turn in perfect harmony and the story is propelled seamlessly along. The tension that builds throughout the entire book (and within individual scenes) is not something you see very often these days, which made this all the more enjoyable. Even though I know the story, I found myself on the edge of my seat more than once. My only complaints all revolve around the same thing: this book is unarguably a product of its time. Written by a white male in the late 80's, it's not very surprising to see the misogyny and total lack of diversity. It really bummed me out to see how whiny and obtuse Lex was written, and it bummed me out even more that they intentionally assigned male pronouns to the apex predator T-rex, despite her being a female. I could have gone my entire life without hearing Malcom's bullshit ""I could look at those legs all day"" comment when he met Ellie for the first time. But speaking of Malcom, for all all his douchiness and abrasiveness, his monologues on chaos theory and paradigms and the planet were probably my favorite part of this book. It's cool to see someone eloquently discuss the same things that you as the reader believe in. I can't believe people think the movie was better lol",en

I think I'm the last person to read this, old guy invests in building a dinosaur island -complete with themed rides, lodging, and REAL DINOS! I've only seen the movie once, and that was around 8 or so years ago (whenever it came out in 3D in the movie theaters)- so I vaguely remember- but was happy to be able to read this without many memories or expectations influencing. The adventure is real here. From discovering the secrets of the island, uncovering the genetics of it, to the thrill of the t-rex chases- it's all there, it's all dramatic, and it's all quite fun to read. The characters are all defined. I was not sad when some of these douchebags died, lol. Although Lex, the granddaughter I felt was portrayed too immaturely- she can't understand that this is life threatening stuff, and to stop asking questions or complain in that situation? Her repetitiveness got very annoying. The storyline cuts between many scenes of characters- I pretty much was always most interested in Dr. Grant's, and could have done with less Muldoon.

1131,526270,983348331,it was ok,"Basically Westworld with dinosaurs10 July 2014	At first I thought Crichton was one of those authors who was lucky enough to have his books converted into films until I actually discovered that Westworld began its life as a movie that was directed by Crichton. That discovery left me wondering whether this book was little more than the novelisation of the Spielberg movie or whether it was a full blown novel in and of itself. Well, as it turns out (and you can work that out simply by looking at the publication date of the novel, which was three years prior to the movie hitting the screens) the novel came before the movie, though upon reading the novel it is not surprising that I was somewhat confused because the movie seemed to follow the movie closely (not that I have seen the movie recently, but the novel did give me flashbacks). In fact, as I was reading the novel, I felt that I was reading the novelisation, or maybe it was Crichton pitching an idea for a movie.	The odd thing is that the plot of Jurassic Park is pretty much identical to the plot of Westworld, the only difference is that Jurassic Park involves dinosaurs as opposed to malfunctioning robots. However, I actually preferred Westworld, even if the bulk of the movie involved the protagonists running away from this guy:	As I suggested though, the plots and the themes of both are pretty much identical, with the exception that one involves dinosaurs and the other involves robots.	One of the ideas that seemed to permeate the novel was the idea of the chaos theory, which was exemplified with a discussion on the weather. Yes, I do understand that discussions on the weather tend to come about because nobody has anything else to talk about (or that the other person simply does not find what you want to talk about all that interesting, and vice versa), but the idea of the weather and the chaos theory is the example that Crichton uses to support his argument that science can never solve everything, and that with every discovery there is another random element that comes about to undermine that discovery.	The idea with the weather that he uses is that no matter how skilled we are, and how knowledgeable we are (or how powerful our computer is) there is no way that we will be able to predict the weather beyond a few days (usually about a week, if that). The thing is that no matter how far we try to predict the weather, a random element is always thrown into the mix that will cause a significant change. It is the butterfly effect – a butterfly flapping its wings in China:will cause a hurricane in Virginia:	As such, no matter how hard we try to create a sterile and perfect environment, a random element (or even an element that we have not considered) will enter the equation and change the entire outcome. For instance, in the novel we have two elements that undermine the controlled environment of the park. As many of you are aware (if you have seen the film) the dinosaur DNA was reconstructed using DNA from other, similar, animals, including frogs. However, what was not taken into account was that frogs can change their sex if there is one sex lacking in the environment. This was the case in the park because they had created all of the dinosaurs as females to prevent breeding, but because they used frog DNA, the dinosaurs ended up changing their sex, and breeding.	The other element was that the scientists did not know all that much about the dinosaurs, which is not surprising because all we really know about them is based on the bones that we have dug up from the ground (and I believe that the bones themselves have rotted away, meaning that the scientists would not have been able to get the dinosaur DNA from the fossils, because they are not bones per se - I have included a link to a website on fossilisation for more information on the subject, because not being a scientist I cannot say for certain). As such, when they created the velociraptor, they turned out to be much more intelligent, and much more dangerous, than they initially believed. (view spoiler)[Oh, and there is also the aspect known as human greed in that one of the employees, despite being on a six-figure income, turns off all of the security systems so that he can smuggle some embryos out of the part for the benefit of the competition (hide spoiler)].	Which brings me to my final point. I had always believed that the velociraptor was something created by Spielberg simply for the movie, however it turns out that this is not the case. Shows you how much I know about dinosaurs (though as a kid I loved dinosaurs, but then as Crichton says in his book, kids love dinosaurs, not that this book was written for kinds, or even teenagers, which is why the two kids in the book pretty much annoyed me). As for the raptor, whenever I heard them referred to it as such, I couldn't help but think of this:",en

1141,526270,265660395,it was amazing,John Hammond has spent his life trying to create something incredible and now that he’s in his 70’s he’s done it at last. After a few attacks on a beach in Costa Rica the question of if a new lizard species exists on the island after several children are attacked. With Jurassic Park’s opening just a year away it’s come into question the safety of the park so an impromptu weekend with some consultants should be exactly what they need to satisfy the investors. Hammond brings in Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler two very well-known specialists in their field of paleontology and paleobotany. With Ian Malcolm who created the chaos theory as well as his grandchildren tossed in the mix it’s sure to be a well-rounded group.It’s not till they arrive that they have any idea what Hammond has been doing at the island but genetically creating long extinct dinosaurs for a theme park. Since this is a state of the art park everything is run by computers so when the system goes down suddenly the dinosaurs are lose wreaking havoc on the guests. Not only are dinosaurs getting off the island somehow but now they are breeding on the island and roaming free with the systems down. It will take everything they have to bring the park back up and make it off the island in one piece. For Book club this month we decided to read Jurassic Park. This is actually a re-read for me but with the new moving coming out I was all for it. I admit it’s been a long time so I didn’t remember all the parts but I had a good idea. It’s amazing how much more detail is in the book and how the story differs from the movie I’ve watched over and over. While the movie puts Hammond as more of the good guy with good intentions the book brings to light the darker side of who he is. I liked seeing the characters as the author anticipated them. We had a little role reversal with the children in ages but I think it worked either way. I honestly loved the darker story of the book over the movie it’s just so captivating. Don’t get me wrong I really enjoyed the movie. I really enjoyed the authors writing style it just flows so smoothly from start to finish it was hard to put down. He created this beautiful but dangerous world taking the concept of genetically creating dinosaurs from fossilized amber. I know I’m not the only one who is secretly hoping this one day could happen well I hope not. However I hope we have learned from this series and don’t make the same exact mistakes when it comes to opening a park. I know I won’t be in line for opening weekend but one day maybe. I just really enjoyed the book it’s an amazing story one of my favorites that I read with my father growing up. I actually read the book before the movie came out and I feel that for the technology at the time they did a wonderful job. I can’t wait to re-read lost world next it was my favorite of the two. Even though my favorite dinosaur from the second book never made it to the big screen yet. Highly recommend a must for all sci fi dinosaur fans. ,en
1142,526270,1851022767,really liked it," ...PSA: After reading this book, you'll look at the first Jurassic Movie and go ""wow!! i've totally been cheated off what could have been an even more awesome movie"" Hollywood tricked us.First off character wise everything was way different from the movie. Alan Grant had a beard and Sattler wasn't his love interest. Gennaro wasn't a whimp, Ian Malcom was an egotistical douchebag that never followed this rule when talking - Keep It Simple; Dennis Nerdy was still fat and a collosal idiot, Timothy was a star, Alex was an annoying shitty child that i honestly would have fed to the dinosaurs with absolutely no regrets and finally Hammond was a psychotic troll that would have sacrificed his grandkids if it meant he could keep the park open... Supporting characters : Ed Regis - Wimp! Robert Muldoon - Kick ass dude, Harding: didn't really get that much action.This book is about a rich fella who decides to play God and create Dinosaurs. But does he create just those cute dinosaurs that don't eat people? Nope!! he creates those meat eating ones too, like sooh wait, hehehee Like soUnlike the movie you can look forward to people dying gruesome horrible deaths from the jaws and poisons of dinosaurs which trust me makes up for all the talk on chaos theory, fractals, DNA, dinosaur bones and basically everything Ian Malcom says in this book. All in all despite Micheal Crichton's attempt to sabtoge his book anytime Ian Malcom spoke or Dr. Wu tried to explain the glory of DNA (Frankly except you're Sheldon Cooper you probably won't get all those stuffs either) i really enjoyed this book.P.S: you can't outrun a T-rex in heels.Muldoon: The rex is out there, somewhere...and we don't have any weapons worth a damn""Gennaro: We're in a jeepMuldoon: Oh he can outrun a jeep. Once we leave this road and go onto open terrain, the best we can do in a four wheel drive is thirty, forty miles an hour. He'll run us right down. No problem for him""You're welcome.",en

If there was a way to give a 3.5, I would do it, as it falls somewhere between a simple ""I liked it"" and the four star dynamo that is the movie version. From that you can probably tell, despite reading the book, I love the movie more. This is partly from the nostalgic hold the movie has on my heart, the ""well, I experienced this first"" phenomenon, and partly because the movie has the advantage of being capable of visually wowing you with the sight of, my God, REAL dinosaurs!That said, there were some things in the book that I would've loved to see brought to screen. For instance, rocket launcher-wielding Muldoon. I need that in my life. Or big T-rex swimming. I also need that. Or cuddly baby velociraptors. Don't question me, I just want it.I also found a deeper appreciation for some of the well-known characters from the book. I loved Gennaro, and honestly couldn't very well comprehend why the other characters more or less turned on him toward the end, when he took such a huge part in helping, or at least trying to, everyone through the crisis. And unlike the blood-sucking Gennaro from the film, he didn't immediately cast aside any considerations of danger once he realized how much money it would make him. He was still determined to shut it down regardless, if it meant people would be hurt. One could argue this is the lawyer's reaction to avoiding lawsuits, but when you have that much money, who would care?Malcolm was still...kind of annoying, but. I finally understood why they brought a mathematician along on a trip to a dinosaur park. Ellie was equally more useful and more fun in the book, I found, despite already liking her character. The children were less annoying, particularly Tim, and Lex was even somewhat excusable some of the time. Grant was just fun. And Hammond...was incomparable to the film version. Let's just say, I'm glad he died. Satan.Despite all this, though, the movie is nearer and dearer to my heart, and it will always be ranked a notch or two above the book. ",en
1145,526270,1397556002,it was amazing," I thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of horror, suspense, drama, humor, and even philosophy in Jurassic Park. On the surface, this is a superb thriller, even if you have seen Spielberg's classic adaptation. However, beyond the carnage and dinosaur rampage, Crichton addressed timeless themes and issues. Ian Malcolm is Hammond's foil in the story. Hammond, on the one hand, is an eccentric billionaire, seeking to use science for big-entertainment--""use"" is too light of a term: he seeks to control the unknown. Ian Malcolm, on the other hand, is a witty, philosophical chaos mathematician, who understands humans cannot control everything. The banter and remarks between these two characters make the book worth reading all on their own. It seems Crichton seeks to demonstrate, in a gritty morality tale with dinosaurs, what happens when humans seek not only to master nature but also to materialize it for profit, not caring about the consequences. Jurassic Park is a story about consequences. Seeing how the characters react to their mistakes and situations will make you compare their moralities to the those of our world. Surprisingly, being an 80's novel, it does not feel out-dated--the only nostalgic detail seems to be Timmy's reaction to a touch-screen computer. Other than that, the technologies, the science, the dinosaur mayhem, and the timeless lessons will absolutely appeal to our generation and to most ages.",en

This is one of the few times I've seen a movie leave out pointless action sequences. There's this whole long nonsense about rafting down the river and pterodactyls and the T-Rex coming back every two seconds like a homing missile and it becomes completely unbelievable that they survived all that. And THEN out of the blue after they finally come back, the power is on, they're safe at the lodge, Grant and Ellie decide to go BACK out into the raptor nest, it was just too silly. How would they not be delirious by then after all those hours awake and on the run I don't know, or perhaps that accounts for the lapse in judgement. Either way it was too much, the scientists seemed recklessly moronic.I would also like to mention the deaths are different in the book, some I expected from the movie never happened and some people that didn't die in the movie died in the book. I guess I rec it if you're really into the movie and want to see the source material but I would say the movie is far better, it trims the fat and improves the ending by not dragging it out like the book does.

1147,526270,589031907,really liked it,"Jurassic Park is definitely one of the best books I have ever read! It was a bit difficult to get into at first due to the fact that Crichton's writing style is completely different than what I have been reading the past few weeks. It was a bit of a turn off at first, but once I got used to it and read into a few chapters, I got over my initial hesitation. I had seen the movie before and didn't even know it was based on a book until recently and I must say, the ending was completely unexpected. As always tends to be the case, the book is much better than the movie. Things are explained much better, there are details and scenes that I wish had been in the movie that added to the story. The book was more than about escaping the island, it actually makes me think about certain things differently and gives me a new view on scientific topics.The only thing I absolutely hated about this book, however, was Lex. She is literally the most annoying character I have ever met in my entire life. I know she's young and she's in this park full of dinosaurs, but she was unnecessarily irritating! The book is also a bit confusing at times, with much talk about Chaos Theory and different mathematical models, but it was easy to look past if you try to think about it too much and just keep reading. Crichton, for the most part, did a pretty good job at explaining quite a few complicated things.",en

So, it shouldn't be in the least bit surprising for me to say that the book was better than the movie. And the movie was awesome. I'm mean, Jeff Goldblum. How well cast was he as Ian Malcolm?

Is there anyone left who HASN'T seen Jurassic Park or any of the incarnations yet? If you enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the book more. It is so much more in depth, and so much more gratifying.

Intelligent, edge-of-your-seat non-stop thrill ride. I cannot say enough about it.What Michael Crichton had done was to create a completely believable tale, one that sounded as if it could possibly come true with the right elements in place. Heart-pounding suspense, and one of the most exciting story lines I've read in ages.I can't say enough about this book except if you've always wanted to read it to see what the hoopla was about, then please, by all means, read it today.The only thing that disappointed me was that the author had passed away a few years ago and that was something I hadn't known.

She was constantly putting Dr Grant and Tim in danger. I always wanted to tell her to shut up. However, I am partly in error because I kept picturing her as the older character in the film, but she's actually only 7 or 8 years old in the book, so her reactions are more reasonable for her age than for a teenager. Also, Malcolm's chaos theory explanations got a little tiresome. Other than those two minor things, I loved it. There were some really intense parts and I didn't want to put the book down. I even liked the scientific explanations of how they created the dinosaurs, which is rare for me. The ending is slightly anticlimatic, but I thought it was well done because after all the killing, it makes you feel sympathy for the velociraptors. Everyone, read this!",en

I really enjoyed reading more about genetics and mutation, and - shocking - Ian Malcom in the book is more than a hot body. He has all the best punch-in-the-face lines. On other hand, dr. Sattler isn’t as important in the book as she’s in the movie (still a great character).If you like me love the movies, you should give the book a try. I can’t wait to read the sequel!

1163,526270,1276346344,liked it,"I should start this review by saying: I love dinosaurs. I love dinosaurs so much that I feel this review may be a little biased as a result. It's not necessarily factual information that I love, which is perhaps how I was so able to enjoy the book (and the subsequent film), but it is the very idea of dinosaurs that has always excited me. As a child, I loved dinosaurs. This love was never encouraged by anyone. It was never discouraged, either, but lack of encouragement resulted in me forgetting over the years how much I had loved dinosaurs, and that for many years I wanted so badly to be a paleontologist like Grant in the movie. I remember watching the movie as a kid, and I was never afraid of it. Rather, I was fascinated by the dinosaurs. I always loved the films, and so when I saw that the book store had stocked this especially for the 25th anniversary, I was happy. I was excited. I was ready to dive right into Jurassic Park. This was my face. 
I got so much more from the book than just dinosaurs, though. I mean, don't get me wrong, the dinosaurs are nice, but the book itself. Wow. I do admit, I am probably biased, but having taken a Humanities course on technological change and how it impact society, I realized quickly that there is an underlying message in the book. I could relate a lot of what I read to the Humanities course, and I thoroughly enjoyed that. The book has it all. It has Luddites, it has technology left behinds, it has references to how as a society we rely heavily on technology (as my professor always said ""It is because, as a species, we are puny""), and it has an overall message in regards to technological advance. I guess the message may be up to interpretation. At some points in the book, it seems to paint the technology as entirely negative. Other instances, however, provide a more neutral look. It is neither positive or negative, it just is. When it becomes negative, as Malcolm states plainly closer to the end, is when humans get too confident in their abilities. As the scientists in the book do. They believed they could control something that was, in the end, entirely out of their control. I am sure my professor had a field day with this one if he ever read it, and I'm sure he had a field day with the movie when it came out (safe to assume he watched it, you'd have to live under a rock not to!). Technology just is, and just as we found ways to adapt, Malcolm points out in the end that the Earth does. Whether you agree with the overall message or not (I did at some times, did not at others), it still makes the book even more interesting than being ""just dinosaurs"". Apparent underlying message aside, I really did enjoy the book. The science is wrong at times, and the information about paleontology and dinosaurs is a bit outdated (as Grant points out, it is a growing field - that changes every time new information is discovered). Crichton describes all his dinosaurs in detail, but despite his descriptions I could not help but picture the velicoraptors more like this
Of course, though, at the time the book was written there was likely still debate about whether they would have had feathers or not. I think even when I was in school I learned that they were probably more reptilian (which is surprising since the book addresses this, describing them as more of a combination of reptilian and avian, but public education does lag behind sometimes). He, also, uses the wrong names, but I think this is intentional as he seems to address this (referring to certain dinosaurs as the ""correct"" names) and seems mostly to be doing this for the reader.There are things that bothered me about the paleontology (the way the digging was described, as well as the handling of the fossils, seemed wrong), but I will leave that up to someone with more knowledge there to explain. I tend to gravitate more toward the social sciences these days than the physical ones. So, moving on with the review, I really did enjoy this book. The only reason I cannot give it more than three stars has a lot to do with the character development. Simply put, many of them felt like the same character. I could see growth as the book progressed in some, particularly Malcolm (I hated him less by the end than I did in the beginning), but for the most part they all felt like they were stagnant. The writing style doesn't help much, either. I know many writers follow the rule of never using anything between dialogue other than ""said"" and ""asked"", but in practice this doesn't always work. Sometimes we need the descriptors. I feel in a thriller/horror science-fiction novel they are important. These people are fighting for their lives. They are trying to defend themselves against dinosaurs. Nothing would have been wrong with saying ""he screamed"" or ""she said anxiously"" or ""he said between crying"". Those would have made the characters seem less flat. As was written, I had trouble - at times - believing they realized they were in true danger.The exception to this rule were the kids. Tim and Lex seemed to realize how much danger they were in. A lot of people criticize this by saying they behaved stupidly, but they're kids and they were in danger. Their behavior, at times, made sense to me. There were some instances where this was ruined. Times where the kids seemed either too calm, or too complacent, but when the actual danger was occurring, they were terrified, and I could tell they were. It made me wonder what happened after they left the park. As a psych nerd, I began to realize the real horror would be the scars they'd suffer mentally during their development because they were, you know, almost eaten by a t-rex. The plot was involving, from beginning to end pretty much. Even though I knew what was going to happen (as I said, you'd had to have lived under a rock not to), I could not stop reading. There was little action, but when there was action it was pretty well written. There is a lot of technical talk, but it's not too hard to get through it. I admit that I skimmed some of it, as some of it felt pointlessly pedantic and unnecessary. Though what is common sense now, may not have been then, so I tried to keep that in mind while reading. The world created in the book is intriguing, though. The whole idea of an island full of dinosaurs is - to someone who loves dinosaurs, at least - very awesome. Despite the fact that his characters seem to lack any real development (barring a few), I really did enjoy this book. It has its flaws - the characters, the science (at times), the fact that many of the characters seemed unaffected by the park going wrong (I do think that was kind of the point, though), etc - but for all it's flaws, I loved it. I have to be honest, though, I didn't read it for the characters. I didn't read it for the plot. I read it for this
and I got that, so I was not disappointed. ",en
1164,526270,2492622076,really liked it,"After all these years of Jurassic Park making me wish dinosaurs were still alive, and simultaneously hoping that they'll stay forever extinct, I finally picked up the book.I was surprised to discover that some of the most iconic scenes from the movie were created by Spielberg and aren't in the novel.I was also surprised to discover that a lot of amazing action scenes, cool plot twists and awesome dinosaurs from the book didn't make it to the screen.Micheal Crichton put a ton of details and research into his story. Even though I probably know the movie by heart now, it felt like rediscovering Jurassic Park all over again - but on a much more profound and insightful level.The characters were a bit one-dimensional, hence the one missing star. They were created to serve the plot, and in that sense they worked perfectly. I just wished there would have been a bit more depth to them. Jurassic Park is about more than just dinosaurs (even if, let's be real, they're a huge plus). It is about human nature, about the hypocrisy and superiority complex of the scientific and about our insatiable need for entertainment.
Grant shook his head. ""It's been discussed, in the field. Many people imagined it was coming. But not so soon.""""Story of our species,"" Malcolm said, laughing. ""Everybody knows it's coming, but not so soon.""
It is an important and intelligent criticism to modern society and one of my favorites, because dinosaurs.I recommend reading this on a tropical island, surrounded by bird calls and rustling bushes for the maximum experience.

I watched all of the movies and watched fan theory videos on Youtube. However I did not read the book. I'm drowning in my TBR, I can't just read a book whenever I want, there are other things to read. It took me months to get to my reread of Ready Player One so I could watch the movie.I have to say I like the movie more. Its not the book's fault, the movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Also not the book's fault is that its just not my taste. I have said before and I'll probably say it again that action is not my thing. I have a hard time keeping up with it, at some point it just becomes a blur of words. This books relies heavily on its action scenes. Regardless, I had fun reading it, well as much as I could with trying to keep up with the action scenes.The novel lost some of it magic with just being words on a page, with the movie we could actually see the dinosaurs. However, the novel was able to do way more scenes with the dinosaurs.

Having seen the movie based on the book about 1000 x's (I am totally serial) that plot had replaced the snarky brilliance of Crichton's work. Now having just watched two seasons of Westworld (the idea of out of control technology first told by Crichton in the early 70's) I am even more appreciative of the technical details of JP#1.In all honesty in this book and its sequel Crichton added child characters to give the adults some one to explain things to that you theoretically wouldn't need to explain to other adults. And these children are a little (okay a lot) annoying. granted the book characters are 10000x's less annoying than their Spielbergian counterparts. I also prefer Crichton's dispatching of the various characters and the description of Hammond's huberis and his inability to accept responsibility for any of the problems. ,en

That might be an odd thing to mention but some films are so memorable that they can literally bring back very specific memories from when you saw them, that is the magic of cinema, I truly believe it, and I still get that sense of nostalgia when I walk into the cinema to watch a film today. I have seen Jurassic Park countless times since then but I hadn’t even thought to read the source material until my passion for reading came back over the last few years.I picked up my copy from a local charity shop and added to my tbr of books that I was gonna read soon, as opposed to my tbr of books that I might read in the far away land that never comes.

The films follows the book pretty closely, however I was quite surprised in the difference between the two, I normally struggle to read books where I’ve seen the film first, but I think there were enough changes and differences between the two to make the story feel new. For me the star of the book (much like the movie) is. Dr. Ian Malcolm, I could happily read a book entirely made up of his chaos theory work, and predictions. I’m not going to go into to much detail because most of you know the story, but if you haven’t yet read this and you are a fan of the film, then add this to your soon to be read tbr.

1172,526270,351221020,it was amazing,"If there is one thing—only ONE thing—that anyone has to know about me to really get inside of my soul, it’s that Jurassic Park is one of the many extreme loves of my entire life. Of course, before now, I meant the movie, because I think it’s incredible for reasons that make this novel incredible as well. I’ll get back to that, but I’d like to start by saying, now that I’ve read the book, I’m pretty blown away. Completely, in fact.This novel is so amazing, and it begins with the initial premise of the conflict of ethics and the complex world that we live in. Michael Crichton is a phenomenal writer because he has such a beautiful understanding of the world and he writes on such overwhelming subjects with this stunning authority and clarity. He reminded me of Stieg Larsson (I know I always say that, but bear with me) because he also writes about things that could easily seem inherently boring—like math, philosophy, or paleontology—in a way that consumes the reader and really hits home. I felt his passion when he wrote about Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler’s backgrounds in paleontology and paleobotany, respectively. I enjoyed it so much because Crichton was vastly educated on the subject of science, both real and imaginary, and he wrote it in a way that was human, but without compromising the technicality of the language. It was on a whole other level, I’m telling you.Another thing that I loved about this book was Crichton’s voice throughout. Everything was so calculated and executed with absolute perfection; I was incredibly taken aback by Crichton’s prowess and his exactitude. I think when we all think of Jurassic Park we think of those iconic scenes with the Tyrannosaurus Rex attacking the jeep with Hammond’s grandchildren in it or the Velociraptors stalking their prey ruthlessly throughout the park with alarming intelligence. That was something I took into account before reading because I wasn’t sure how those action scenes would play out in such a heavily scientific tome or how they would sound to the mind's ear, but I needn’t have worried for a second because it was so much more than I could have ever dreamed of. What MADE those scenes when Dr. Grant and the kids are stranded out in the middle of the park was Crichton’s chillingly methodical narrative voice; it is probably one of the most effective writing techniques I have ever had the privilege to read. It is so terrifying and horrifying to read in the absolute best way possible. Crichton writes with this cold, factual precision:
“He suddenly knew he was holding his own intestines in his hands.”
There’s no cheap melodrama, there’s no dwelling on fear or emotions; it’s this detached reporting that ACCENTUATES the real fear that the characters (and, by extension, the readers) feel without divulging it outright. That’s so much more POWERFUL and stimulating than melodrama could ever be.Basically, if you’re in it for the action, this novel MORE than delivers. It’s gripping and consuming—I could not put it down come nightfall because I was so worked up over it and I felt like I couldn’t leave the characters in peril (which they constantly were in). It’s a book that keeps on giving in that way, but it’s still brilliantly paced right down to the last comma. Action aside, it also delivers in the sense that it’s so incredibly thought-provoking. I was actually very impressed with Crichton’s semiotic analysis of society and of entertainment. It’s like I said at the beginning of this review: he has such an expansive and deep understanding of the world and it REALLY shows. He developed an extraordinary character in Dr. Malcolm who spoke so eloquently about all things scientific and ethical. There were so many amazing passages that moved me that came from that character; he was so profound, but still human. He had a fantastic sense of humor, but he was relentless in all that he did—I really appreciated him. And that kind of connects back to what I said to start off with as well: Crichton is blessed with the talent of exposing scientific and mathematical theory in a relatable and resonating way.All in all, this book is pretty perfect. The only thing that warranted half a star being knocked off of its flawless rating was that, while I enjoyed Dr. Malcolm more than I probably should have, I thought towards the end that every time he opened his mouth he had a speech to give. They were still amazing speeches, I just thought his dialogue should’ve been more evenly dispersed with cutting one-liners between the awesome ranting towards the end. But that is a very, very tiny criticism in the grand schematic of this novel. It is some absolutely stunning science-fiction and, if you are into that, I ask of you, “What are you waiting for?” I could go on for days—this novel is perfection, the way I see it—but I will refrain. It’s intelligent, it’s frightening, it’s insane, and it’s amazing. It also really stands up to re-reading, which isn’t something I’ve thought about many of the new-to-me books I’ve read this year. Overall, very impressive and fantastic. I can’t wait ‘til I finish some of the bigger novels I’m working on now so I can get into the sequel, The Lost World, in which I hear my favorite guy is playing the main character.Bless. ",en

It's one of those books that you tell yourself you're going to read, but you never do. I loved the film and I think that's part of the reason I couldn't read it. Because part of me was worried that the movie was too similar to the book - I need not have worried, because the book is very different to the movie. Both are awesome. The movie dumbed down a lot of the book (which wasn't really an issue - because we were all in awe of the dinosaurs anyway).Parts of the book were used in the second movie though (the opening with the little girl on the beach and also the idea of the aviary).In the book Grant and Ellie were never romantically involved, Timmy is the wiz with computers, there was more than 1 T-rex, Hammond and Malcolm didn't survive and there were ALOT more raptors.The book was fascinating, extremely clever and genuinely gripping. The ending was rather abrupt though.",en
1178,526270,1335056545,it was amazing,"What if we could rebuild the world as it was millions of years ago? What if we could bring back plants and animals that are extinct? Could we? Should we? Twenty-five years after its initial publication, Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton continues to thrill readers and dares to tackle the questions of ethics in scientific discovery. A 1993 movie adaptation became a blockbuster, spawned three sequels, and cemented Jurassic Park as a pop culture phenomenon. But as with most book to film adaptations, the novel offers much more detail and a richer overall experience.The corporate world is abuzz with word of Ingen's new project. The corporation is run by the peculiar John Hammond who has funneled large amounts of money into a mysterious enterprise on a Caribbean island. Hammond has assembled a curious team of geneticists, zoological experts, computer scientists, and former theme park managers for his newest venture. As his competitors scramble to discover the secrets of his project, Hammond faces problems of his own. Whatever is being done on the island has caused death and serious injury to some of the local construction workers. Ingen's board sees massive potential in Hammond's endeavors, but they worry about the skyrocketing costs and the inherent physical hazards. In order to ease the minds of the board, investors, and company lawyers, Hammond invites a group of experts to tour his island before it is revealed to the public. Doctors Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, paleontologist and paleobotanist respectively, are among the experts who are summoned to the island. Grant is much more at home digging up the remains of the long extinct animals he studies, but Hammond's generous funding of his digs does much to persuade him to leave the comfort of his dirt and bones. The duo is joined by Dr. Ian Malcolm, a hot shot mathematician from the University of Texas who specializes in the chaos theory. Also along for consultation is a lawyer hired by the investors, Donald Gennaro. Hammond tells his panel of experts that his high stakes project is a ""biological preserve"" that he plans to open as a state of the art amusement park. As the group enters Jurassic Park, it becomes clear that this is not a typical zoo. The main attraction is a scientific feat that will revolutionize the study of genetics and create unprecedented profits for Ingen. Jurassic Park is the home to living dinosaurs. At first glance, Jurassic Park is a quintessential sci-fi thriller. Michael Crichton writes of a genetic regeneration program founded in the science of the time (which turns out to be pretty questionable with 25 years of hindsight) to craft a clever narrative of discovery gone wrong. On the surface level, the story works as an effective piece of entertainment. Beyond the stereotypes of the genre, the novel becomes a cautionary tale. In the vein of Frankenstein, the men of science in this novel must face the repercussions of their discoveries. Crichton weaves philosophical questions of morality and responsibility in the face of technological advancement into his tale of exploration and corporate intrigue. This allows Jurassic Park to be a thoughtful commentary on greed and stock driven research while still maintaining a page turning pace. Unlike the movie, the villains of this novel get what's coming to them in deliciously devilish detail that will leave you thoroughly satisfied. Even better, those who practice logic and reason become the heroes of this fable. Twenty-five years later, Jurassic Park remains a smart and thrilling pillar of fantastic storytelling. ",en

It's always hard to decide whether the book caused the reading slump or whether the reading slump affected the enjoyment of the book. This makes rating it so hard. But I finally decided on 3.5 Stars.Jurassic Park is a good book. It is a science fiction thriller that easily captures the reader's attention and takes them on an intense journey with enough suspense, blood, and dinosaurs to keep them on the edge of their seat.And it was awesome in a lot of ways. The science part was my favourite part of the novel. Crichton has some interesting views on the progression of science, and why it might go too far. I don't think I need to explain the plot of the novel. But what I found fascinating with it was that it wasn't the dinosaurs that caused the downfall of the park, it was human error. The fact that it was human error rather than the ferocity of the dinosaur's they created, really says a lot.There was only one thing that lessened my enjoyment of this book. Unfortunately, it was enough for me to question my rating. Once again, I do not know if it was due to me being in the midst of a reading slump, but I felt no connection to the characters.This is not a novel that thrives off of character development. It is meant to be an action novel, and it does well in that aspect. But at the same time, I think this kept me from feeling a lot of the suspense that this novel called for. I read it with mere curiosity at what was going to happen next, instead of being anxious for the characters.There was a scene in the beginning of the novel where they drop an innocent goat into a dinosaur's cage. It's chained to the ground, helpless, and it just made me so sad to see such an innocent animal get eaten. It didn't do anything to deserve that. I was in despair over this goat. It sounds weird, but or some reason, it just got to me that an innocent animal was used like that. And although throughout the rest of the novel there are a lot of deaths, I never really felt that horrible feeling again. I never felt much of anything. And that was what stopped this book from being absolutely spectacular for me.This book had it all. It had a wide cast of characters, an amazing array of dinosaurs that were vividly depicted and well-researched, and enough action to never bore the reader. And yet it was the lack of empathy for the characters that really stopped me from enjoying this novel.",en
1181,526270,1431123433,liked it,"BLUF: This book is exactly how you think it will be. Good, but dated.Plot: Eccentric Billionaire, John Hammond, owns a bioengineering firm which ventures into the re-creation of dinosaurs with the purpose of creating a zoo – the first of its’ kind. It’s not entertaining to have only omnivores; Hammond creates the carnivores too. Due to investor concerns (specifically, the deaths of some workers due to “construction accidents”, EPA investigations, and lizard attacks on nearby islands), Hammond’s lawyers advises that outside experts be brought in as a test trail for the park. What should have been an enlightening weekend trip soon turns into a nightmare when the park’s system crashes.My Apathy: I’m disappointed in myself for not liking this book more than I did. I have read Michael Crichton outside this series and enjoyed it, but there is something about horror books with animals as the scare factor that just doesn’t work for me. Ghosts, paranormal, etc. scare me. Dinosaurs, killer insects, etc. do not. That said, if you are a person who does get scared by man-eating dinosaurs, you will love this book. There are many close calls and enough tension to keep you on edge.As for the rest: The story is pretty darn good. It’s everything you could want: there are those in the shop trying to bring the park back on line, those in the field fighting for their lives and to get back in the resort, and many deaths in between the groups. The characters were realistic in their flaws and personality, but I don’t really have anything to say about them. (Three weeks later and they don’t stick in my head. Hmm…) Comparison to the movie: The movie does not majorly deviate from the story until after the car crashes down the tree. This is perfect for those of us who cannot envision a book after seeing a movie, as it allows us to view the book from our perspectives. (I hate the feeling of déjà vu that comes when this happens.)My real only complaint: As with The Lost World, Ian Malcolm drove me up the wall. This character will talk your ear off and it is absolutely painful. I’m not sure if this is because he is into himself or if it is simply the content of his speech. Thankfully, he has much less of a role in this book than he does in The Lost World.",en
1182,526270,1393546483,it was amazing," ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" And this is the line that ran through my head every time I opened this book. I love the Jurassic Park films, even the third one. And the new one blew my mind. They will always hold a special place in my heart. And lets be honest, Dinosaurs are kick ass. If Jurassic Park was real, I'd totally risk it and have a look.  Books are generally better than the films but this book wasn't better or worse. It was different. But different is a good way. Spielberg catered his film towards a PG audience, whereas the book is for adults.  The book has way more science and the characters are darker. You won't be finding a friendly grampa type Hammond here. No this Hammond is a ruthless business man, who cares more about money than the danger. I really didn't like him in the book! I was glad about his unhappy ending. I still loved Grant and Ian but Lex was the most annoying kid in fiction and I will criticize Crichton here, as why did the girl have to be this typical bratty kid? Girl like Dinosaurs to!  And those have seen the film will recognise key scenes here. There are a fair few others thrown in and even something that they saved for the third film. One of my favourite scenes in the third film. I have a soft spot for Pterodactyl.  I'm not sure the use of graphs really added anything but I guess some people will appreciate them . Overall this book gets full marks for being a page turning dinosaur thriller. Now if you excuse me, I think I may have to watch the film..... ",en
1183,526270,2323230730,liked it,"I find it impossible to talk about this novel without bringing the Steven Spielberg film adaptation into the discussion. What Crichton captures is the blunt force brutality of the animals within the story, the novel is much darker than the film with scenes of disembowelment, newborns being pecked at by dinosaurs, and vivid descriptions of carnage. Some characters within the novel are more fleshed out than in the film; characters like Muldoon and Gennaro are displayed as more heroic and compassionate and logical. Scenes of Muldoon hunting down the Tyrannosaur and using a rocket launcher against the raptors are extremely fun and tense and would have been appreciated by readers if it was in the film. Now, while some characters are better developed in the novel, there are also some that are displayed better on screen. Spielberg takes the annoying toddler Lex and creates an older female child character with drive and strength. He also takes Dr. Sattler and gives her more to do, Spielberg highlights the females more than Crichton does with his novel. The film captures more of the magical and whimsical feeling of the story while the novel captures the danger at a height that the film doesn't quite reach. Crichton also delivers crackling dialogue, particularly with the mathematician Ian Malcolm, the novel's strongest moments of character lie with him. The concept of chaos is a well done theme throughout the story and it is a constant source for entertainment.A solid entertaining novel that unfortunately will always be compared to its near flawless film adaptation.

It wasn't as thrilling as I expected and I feel the movie definitely improved on some characters. First off, I'm unaware if this is a common problem or just my copy, but the text was riddled with typos. ""Why hadn't he pushed the radio farmer away?"" Lex, as a character, was thoroughly unnecessary and unenjoyable. She was the most whiny, irritating brat. She solely exists to be a damsel archetype. I wish she had been cut completely. I found myself hoping she would be eaten by a dinosaur nearly every time she was in danger, despite knowing she was going to live. The part with the cearadactyls felt unnecessary, as well. Arnold tells us that ""the aviary is dangerous because the dactyls dive bomb people and are territorial"" but then they only make one attack on the raft carrying Grant and the kids and move on. That doesn't seem territorial to me. The worst that happens is Lex gets her baseball glove stolen. In all, it lasted like one page and seemed like it was just plopped in there. I did like Grant's character and getting to see a few more of the characters in depth, like Arnold and Muldoon. It was nice to see some more explanation on them than the movie gives. All in all, read it if you like the movie. It will give you deeper insight into the characters. But be prepared for some parts to read a little slower than expected.",en

Whatever kind of power you want. President of the company. Black belt in karate. Spiritual guru. Whatever it is you seek, you have to put in the time, the practice, the effort. You must give up a lot to get it. It has to be very important to you. And once you have attained it, it is your power. It can’t be given away: it resides in you. It is literally the result of your discipline. Now, what is interesting about this process is that, by the time someone has acquired the ability to kill with his bare hands, he has also matured to the point where he won’t use it unwisely.

Oh, and that missing enzyme thing, too, so, ah, basic nutrition? And what was Crichton's beef with Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson? He very clearly vilified the man at every opportunity. And considering how thoroughly he fucked up chaos theory in this book, I highly doubt he had the math chops to take on anything Dodgson ever said.

A man gets mauled by some kind of animal, babies are turning up dead, and a girl gets attacked by some kind lizard. At first, these weird happenings get brushed off. Costa Rica is filled with lush, exotic landscape—animal attacks aren’t exactly that out of the ordinary. But when a drawing of this strange lizard grabs the attention of some doctors and scientists, they’re all baffled. What kind of animal is this? Something brand new and undiscovered??It starts to make sense, however, when we meet Dr. Alan Grant and his young assistant Dr. Ellie Sattler who are paleontologists working in Montana. They get a call from their boss and wealthy funder John Hammond, who invites them to his private island for a few days. He’s in need of their expert advice and he’s willing to pay them nicely for it. Thinking him nothing but an old, rich kook, they agree. What they find upon their arrival is nothing short of a miracle. Real dinosaurs!Dr. Henry Wu has taken the blood out of fossilized mosquitoes and used it to clone dinosaurs. He’s found a way to repair any damaged DNA and bring dozens of different species back from the dead. Literally. Now there’s a whole park filled with dinosaurs and Hammond is ready to show the world his new tourist attraction. All the scientists that have come to visit are anxious about the dangers of these Wild animals, but Wu and Hammond are quick to assure them that safety precautions have been made. All the cloned dinosaurs are female and can’t breed. Everything is fenced in with strong, electric fencing. Every dinosaur is dependent on a specific enzyme that’s given to them by the caretakers and wouldn’t survive if they ever managed to escape. Everything seems to be accounted for, but Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler can’t escape their nervous anxiety about the whole thing.When a bad storm suddenly falls over the island and they lose power, everything quickly crumbles. Apparently Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler weren’t nervous for nothing after all… (hide spoiler)]THE GOODGAH!! I love the way Crichton wrote this and I’m kind awed by him right now. So much nerding-out is happening.I LOVE how he captured short bursts of moments that seem completely random, but eventually form a bigger picture over time. In the beginning it all feels a little chaotic. A man gets taken to a hospital and appears mauled, a girl gets attacked, a baby gets eaten… As you keep reading, however, you start to realize that there’s something bigger going on. Even after the reader knows about Jurassic Park and Hammond’s scheme, Crichton writes the same way. Most of the characters end up getting separated and spread out over the whole park, so he shows short bursts of each one—someone hiding from a T-Rex, the control room guys scrambling to get the power on, someone getting thrown into a tree. It all creates this undercurrent of anxiety and nervousness that was perfect for this book.There’s also a CRAP TON of science in this story and I was completely shocked that I could follow most of it. When it comes to science, I know the bare minimum and it was never my favorite subject in high-school. Before diving into this, I was completely expecting to be confused an nod along, but that wasn’t the case! Everything was explained really well and broken down in understandable ways. I’ve heard Crichton was known for his extensive research and it definitely shows. I feel like I learned a lot without even trying!Plus, there are dinosaurs guys. DINOSAURS. You can’t go wrong!THE UGLYI. HATE. LEX. I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER. Oh my god, I’ve never wanted to strangle a child so much in my life. Does she ever SHUT UP?!?!? ARGH. Even when I was young, I would have had the presence of mind to NOT COMPLAIN WHEN EVERYONE’S LIFE IS IN DANGER. The whole time they’re trying to make it back to civilization she’s all “I’m hungry” or “I’m tired, can you carry me?” BITCH. WE ALMOST JUST DIED. YOU WALKIN. Not gonna lie, a big part of me wanted her to eat something poisonous and keel over, just so I wouldn’t have to hear her talk anymore. I don’t remember her being that friggin’ annoying in the movie, but it’s been a while, so who knows. Tim was also a tad annoying and a bit of know-it-all, but at least he was helpful and kept his mouth closed most of the time.That was really my only gripe with this book. There was already a lot going on, so I didn’t completely understand why Lex’s sour attitude was really necessary to the story. The little trio of Dr. Grant, Tim, and Lex were already trying to survive in the wilderness, make it back to the hotel, and avoid vicious dinos—did her uncanny ability to attract danger need to be added to the mix?!I also had a hard time keeping track of all the characters. The ones I had strong feelings about were easy to keeps tabs on (*COUGH* Lex *COUGH*), but there were a lot of background scientists and workers that I kept confusing with others. More than once I thought someone had died, only to have them pop up again and discover I had them mistaken for someone else. This is my own problem though, which is what I get for listening to the audiobook instead of reading it.FINAL WORDThis book was GREAT!! I’ve never been so frustrated and enjoyed it! And I learned a lot of stuff!! This book was completely thrilling and I loved every second.",en
1208,526270,2699707424,it was amazing,"This was such an amazing book in every way. At no point when reading did I ever think about the writing. It just flowed so smoothly and easily that it didn't even register. The story was wonderfully complex and well crafted. For so many moving pieces, everything fit together and was easy enough to follow. I had no issues following the science of this story, and I'm not a science person in the slightest. The only science I did struggle with a little was when Ian Malcolm went on long tangents about chaos theory, and I think he was meant to be hard to follow.I really enjoy the movie and they're very similar, but this book just has so much more depth and complexity. It's an incredibly worthwhile read.The only part I didn't enjoy was the little girl, Lex, who was insufferable. I understand she's a small child and small children are often quite annoying, but it was actually painful to read. I honestly considered knocking the book down a star just for how much I hated her presence, but other than her, I had no complaints.",en

Welcome to Jurassic Park. You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time. -151

Innovation, secrecy, unaccountability, greediness, stupidity, stubbornness, and chaos. These are just a few words that sum this up in a nutshell. To dispel concerns and rumors of his company (InGen) wasting funds and causing havoc to the nearby islands, Hammond has invited several people indirectly involved with his overambitious dream to witness what he believes is greatness; Jurassic Park, a living amusement park and ""zoo.""""'He said he was hiring a number of academic consultants, and named them. There were paleontologists like me, and a mathematician from Texas named Ian Malcolm, an a couple of ecologists. A systems analyst. Good group.'"" (41)There are a number of hidden factors that tend to go against the project from the start. Lewis Dodgson, a geneticist in competition with Hammond's findings, plans a way to steal the dinosaur genes: ""...he was the head of product development at Biosyn, which supposedly consisted of 'reverse engineering': taking a competitor's product, tearing it apart, learning how it worked and then making your own version."" (72) Taking on Dennis Nedry, the project supervisor of InGen, as an inside man, the embryos that Dodgson demands are in reach. This alone sets off a number of problems, as Ian Malcolm's (the mathematician) proposed Chaos Theory predicts.""'Theory tells me that the island will quickly proceed to behave in unpredictable fashion... There is a problem with that island. It is an accident waiting to happen.'"" (84) The Chaos Theory, also known as the Butterfly Effect, is a dynamic principle that basically states that anything (non-linear) can be influenced by any amount of variables that in effect render any long-term outcomes or predictions impossible. Natural systems are the best example of this phenomenon, meaning Jurassic Park is no exception and that it's vulnerability to fail (especially with what the park contains) can and will be catastrophic.Another factor involved with the mysterious Jurassic Park is a question of how the Compy's (small chicken sized dinosaurs) are getting to the Costa Rican mainland and attacking people. Hammond is suspiciously trying to cover himself and the park by saying that it is impossible form the small dinos to have come from Jurassic Park because of it's intense security; he then proceeds to try to manipulate the park's systems to prove so. Hammond and his geneticist Dr. Wu, has explained that even if (and that's a strong hypothetical ""if"", according to them) an animal were to escape, it wouldn't last more than 24 hours out in the wild because they were genetically altered to exclude the lysine amino, which is essential to life and they could only receive through supplements on the island. Another precaution they claimed to have taken is by making sure the animals couldn't reproduce. They make sure that they only grow female animals, and they irradiate them for further prevention. Or did they? With the stubborn Hammond in control of this operation Jurassic Park, how far will the chaos theory travel?I loved Jurassic Park from beginning to the end. The research, statistics, science, math and just overall knowledge contained in this book, albeit a fictional journey, had be pinned to the book with enthusiasm and wonderment. This fantasy action adventure fueled by the chaos theory and people wanting to play God, is a mastermind in it's ability to trust it's curious readers with how to interpret the message of Jurassic Park; that life, full of consequences and hope, is unpredictable.""'Life is actually a series of encounters n which one event may change those that follow in a wholly unpredictable, even devastating way.'"" (191)Although a lot is going on throughout the book, the plot's tempo is being driven by a simple boat. That is to say, it's a race against time to get into communication with a boat that is unknowingly carrying Compy's from Isla Nublar toward the Costa Rican mainland, no doubt the reason for the recent lizard attacks there. To me this is a great way to keep the book organized and on point. As Jurassic Park deviates from tourist attraction to potential disaster, readers are left to wonder how much damage could be done and if there is any way to eradicate the problems created from this chaos. I loved the movie as a little girl, but this book is on another level. If helped, this Jurassic Park should definitely be read before seeing the theatrical picture, because it conveys so much more with the imagination than any screen possibly could. I give this book a firm five stars, and am pumped to start on the next book of the series.""'Because the history of evolution is that life escapes all barriers. Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.'"" (178)First Line: ""The late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering."" (Introduction)Last Line: ""And then he turned, and walked back toward the entrance of the hotel."" (448)-----------------------------Quotes""'In the information society, nobody thinks. We expected to banish paper, but we actually banished thought.'"" (80)""'All major changes are like death,' he said. 'You can't see to the other side until you are there.'"" (351)""Hammond shook his head. He would do better next time."" (428)",en
1210,526270,2449128950,it was amazing,"I can remember seeing Jurassic Park in theaters as a kid. It was a surprise and I can remember being so excited to see it that I couldn’t stop the jitters, and I had no idea we were even going to the theaters. The dinosaurs seemed real in the movie and by the time it was over, I felt like I had seen the real thing. After reading the book, you can tell drastic differences between that and the movie, but that is not a bad thing. Like most books-turned-film, there are adjustments here and there for rating purposes, time constraints, and budget concerns. With the book, you get a more in-depth look into the mind and lives of Muldoon, Hammond, Ian Malcolm and all the other characters from the movie, plus the ones that were left out of the film. Crichton's study into genetics and early-90s computers was very detailed but it’s not so overly-detailed that it bothered me or bored me. Crichton also did a lot of studying on behaviors of various species, which he incorporated a lot into the book and what he thought dinosaurs would be like. There are so many action scenes in this book that it makes you wish the movie had just shot for the R-rating.All-in-all, I’m glad I got the urge to finally read this book, and I can’t wait to see what Lost World has in store. 5/5",en

So they are focused on whether they can do something, they never stop to ask if they should do it.""UGH. THIS BOOK. I LOVE THIS BOOK.I don't know what to say other than this book defines my childhood. My dad is a big old weirdo and wasn't super concerned with what I was reading (until I got older and he realized that I was reading things that maybe were a bit above my age), but this was one book he did encourage me to read. I found it on his outdated bookshelf that had been stashed in our basement, filled with a bunch of old college textbooks and 80s fantasy novels with horrificly illustrated covers that screamed 'cheesey' and 'badly written'. This one stuck out to me, though. I recognized the title, we had the VHS upstairs in our movie cabinet and it was ""less gory"" that my parents didn't mind us kids watching it without them.So, I stole it from his shelf. It's not like we weren't allowed to NOT read the books, but in this case, I just didn't bother to ask for permission. I snatched it and raced up to my room and devoured it in a matter of days. It was a comfort book. I read it when I was sad, when I was happy, when I was stressed or when I was avoiding homework. I read it as I grew and understood more of the genetic terminology, the descriptions of the injuries and how fatal they were, the fear that the characters felt more relatable as I grew out of childhood and discovered the fears of the adult world were far more scary now.When my dad discovered I had this hidden in my room, I was expecting to be grounded. Instead, he went and dug around for more of his Crichton books and came and threw them in my room and told me to read them and enjoy. Our version of ""talking about books"" was my dad throwing a book at my head and then leaving the room without saying anything. #dads. I love this book for the writing style. I felt the knowledge given wasn't an info dump, and I never felt like Crichton was talking down to me or that I, as the reader, should instinctively know this information. I also love that there is SO much more to the book than the movie. I applaud Spielberg for the direction he chose to take and the differences he went with and don't feel like the movie is any lesser than the book. In fact, this is one where you can almost say the movie is indeed better than the book if you can't get past the terminology and technical things. But the book just has some great action and more background information to understand some of the things in the movie that maybe just don't flow as well or seem a little stiff. I also appreciate how basically everyone dies in the movie while the book as a much larger surviving cast of characters. #everyoneyouloveisdeadI try not to own multiple copies of books, especially in different formats. I've made a few exceptions, here and there, and Jurassic Park is one of those. I own this in print, e-book, and on Audible and I own the anniversary edition of the movie (Jurassic Park 2/3 are CRAP and do not exist.) I basically dream in dinosaurs, y'all and its how my freshman year roommate and I bonded. We still get together and watch Jurassic Park 8 years later and our birthday gifts we give are usually dinosaur themed.The narrator of Jurassic Park is Scott Brick and in my opinion, does a wonderful job. I've had my husband listen before and he thinks Brick is a bit monotonous and his voices blur together, but I honestly think it works for the book. The almost detached narration lends an eerie quality and makes those moments of tension truly horrific as Brick describes the raptor attacks and the terror that the characters are feeling in that moment.How I wish we had more of this world. The sequel, The Lost World is alright, but it doesn't inspire the same awe and horror as the original Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. It's just a fabulous, really well written and researched sci-fi thriller that has something everyone would find both interesting and terrifying.",en

Un libro recomendado por alguien que acabas de conocerMe imagino que como al igual que la inmensa mayoría, leí el libro después de ver la película y OMG!!! y debo decir que aunque la película me encanta (es la película que más veces he visto en mi vida) se quedó corta respecto al libro.LO BUENO-La premisa. Lo que me encanta de los techno-thrillers es que nos enfrentan a situaciones que son totalmente improbables, y todo justificado de forma ""científica"". ¿Clonar dinosaurios a partir de paleo-ADN? CLARO QUE SE PUEDE-La trama. Se desarrolla de tal manera que te sientes igual que los personajes conforme va avanzando la historia. Al principio sabes tan poco como ellos y te emocionas (para bien o para mal) junto con ellos.-Los dinosaurios. Por favor, a quien no le gustan los dinosaurios?-Los personajes. Son bastantes y todos diferentes.-Los discursos de Ian Malcolm. Al menos para mi, fueron de las mejores cosas del libro porque me parece que tiene razón.LO MALO-La ciencia. Me explico, todo aquel que haya estudiado algo relacionado con ciencias biológicas se puede dar cuenta que todo lo que ocurre es poco menos que imposible.-El desengaño. Estaba tan acostumbrada a la historia contada en la película que al leer el libro parecía algo completamente nuevo pues no son iguales para nada.LIBRO vs. PELÍCULA (ABRIR BAJO TU PROPIO RIESGO)(view spoiler)[-Los personajes son completamente diferentes. En la película, nos presentan a un Dr. Grant al que no le gustan los niños y que aunque interesado, no es demasiado curioso y que ademas mantiene una relación romántica con la Dra. Satler. En el libro, desde el principio se acerca más a los niños (en especial a Tim) y se comporta igual de curioso e intrepido que un niño y únicamente existe una relación maestro-alumna con Ellie.-Tim y Lex son muy diferentes, siendo Tim el hermano mayor adicto a las computadoras y a los dinosaurios y Lex la hermana menor con fascinación por los deportes y por ser fastidiosa.El Sr. Gennaro es física y emocionalmente diferente, además de que en el libro sobrevive.El cambio que más me impacta es en el Sr. Hammond, que en la película es presentado como un ancianito muy agradable y preocupado por sus nietos, empleados, amigos, etc. y que en el libro es un hombre frío y sin escrúpulos al que solo le interesa el dinero.-Henry Wu, Dennis Nedry, Arnold y Muldoon son practicamente iguales, salvo que el primero también muere en la isla y último sobrevive. Todos tienen un poco más de protagonismo.También en el libro aparecen personajes que no llegan a estar en la película.-Mientras que en la película se escucha constantemente la frase ""No reparé en gastos"", en el libro la isla cuenta con el mínimo de recursos para funcionar, suficientes para mantener encerrados a los animales pero no para enfrentar la situación que se presenta.-En el libro ocurren escenas que no aparecen en la película, como el viaje por el río, la jaula de las aves, los velocirraptores a bordo del barco, la busqueda de los nidos o la persecución del T-rex. (Cosas que curiosamente sí aparecen en la tercer película de la serie)-El final de la película es muy diferente al del libro que resulta un poco (mucho) más violento. (hide spoiler)]PORQUE DEBES LEERLO-El libro es muuucho más completo que la película que (casi) todo el mundo conoce-Es considerado un clásico de ciencia ficción por mucha gente-La historia es emocionante y ""educativa""-Trata temas sobre genética, caos, ética y ciencia-Es un buen libro. Punto.Uno de los mejores libros que he leído en lo que va del año...Para la segunda parte, da click aquí -->

1227,526270,2567397907,liked it,"3.5 starsJurassic Park has become a great phenomenon and franchise and one that is very well researched on Michael Crichton's behalf. He did a stellar job behind what each character does and in the creatures and their habitat. The major issues, though, are...1. These are among the smartest people. Why in the world would one of them not immediately take into consideration that among the reptiles and amphibians that they are working with, there is one that has the ability to change gender. If you are all of your dinosaurs to be female, you would definitely want to remove any possibility of a male being in the mix.2. I DESPISED Lex Murphy with an absolute passion. Lex was John Hammond's granddaughter and her older brother, Tim, was also part of the tour. He was much more knowledgeable and passionate about the subject at hand. Lex was unrealistically nagging, annoying, and cared more about her own personal needs than getting out of the troubling situation. The worst was when she was stuck in a tree and when Tim is trying to save her, she picks on him and reminds him of his fear of heights. Really???My favorite character in the entire book was Ian Malcolm. He was a theorist who was often relied on to give his feedback and perhaps the part that struck a chord with me the most was how he reminded those involved with the creation of Jurassic Park that the world is not going to come to an end, but instead human extinction is inevitable. The world always has the ability to rejuvenate itself.This is definitely a book with great intentions and the ability to explore an area of speculation in such a memorable way.

This is the book that one of my all time favourite movies was adapted from, and so I had high expectations from the very beginning.The very first thing that struck me was how unlikeable most of the characters are - Hammond is the most naive and frustrating character I have stumbled across in a long time. I know that he is supposed to be the shady character in the book, but to me he just seemed to be full of forced idiocy - which doesn't seem plausible for the man behind such a massive development.The next character that I found nauseating was Lex - and I'm not surprised that she was completely transformed in light of the movie. I don't think we are told how old she is (correct me if I'm wrong) and I can not even begin to guess at her age. She appears to be a bit of a tomboy, loving baseball and such, but all the way through the book she whines, can't walk for herself, touches things she shouldn't, gets in the way, can't keep quiet. She really grated on me.Don't get me started on Malcolm, at least 80 percent of his dialogue could have been chopped out and I would have been happy. I didn't find myself attached to any of the characters at all, and I will let Crichton off a little on this one, because the book is very much plot-driven. Having said this, some of the detail in the novel was just completely unbelievable (and hey, I know the whole thing is supposed to be far-fetched, but I like to have some kind of explanation as to why certain things might happen). It seems that 'anything goes' is the key to this read and that doesn't quite sit well with me, I'm so glad that it was reigned in a little for the film. The fact that this novel was also supposed to be set on a beautiful island - masses of stunning landscape sliced through with man-made concrete buildings and wire fences escaped me a little. Crichton could definitely have elaborated on this a touch more; could have placed me right in the middle of the scenery. His descriptions of the island (in my own opinion) fell flat.The reason I'm not marking this off as a complete failure is because the basic ideas behind the book are stunning, and it produced such an iconic movie that I watched over and over as a kid. That in itself is one hell of an acheivement.So, well done Crichton for conjuring this one up. I won't be reading anything else by him, but I will always have a bit of a soft spot for Jurassic Park. :)Theme: 10/10Plot: 5/10Characters: 1/10Setting: 4/10Style: 4/10OVERALL:  24/50 (2.4 stars)",en
1229,526270,1671618264,it was amazing,"Could not put this one down. I finished it in about three or four good sessions. A perfect blend of action, suspense, and an above average understanding of several vastly different branches of science keep this plot rolling ... And fast. Don't get me wrong - I love a nice slow burner from time to time, but Chirchton has a gift for keeping things moving. I picked this up while taking a break from Pynchon's, ""V."" and the contrast gave me a lot to think about in terms of writing and style. It made me realize that just because a work is a page turner it doesn't mean that it's shallow or lacking in some way. I often feel that the Potter series is a guilty pleasure because I realize it isn't Ulysses, but then I also consider the series to be good in spite of my nitpicks. This book made me understand something about reading and art in general... A work is best judged on its own without comparison. It's easy for me to get caught up in comparing and contrasting in everything from people to albums. I'm the type of person that admits I not only see labels as necessary but that I also enjoy them. It's how I see connections in things and how I relate to the world around me. I like putting things in their place and thinking about why I feel that way about their positions in my mind. Basically, to me nothing is arbitrary. Loving, hating, and feeling indifferent about something are equally powerful feelings but it's the reasons why I love or hate something that give each feeling it's weight and uniqueness. And that revelation was the entire center of what this rambling review was about... That this book taught me something about myself, others, and art. That everything is best judged on its own merits (or lack thereof). Comparisons are best reserved as descriptors of abstract concepts, not as a way to critique. It's foolish to criticize something or someone for not being like their opposite when being separate from their antithesis is the very thing that makes it ....it. Uniqueness is a profoundly beautiful and rare thing, and to me Jurassic Park is unique for being equal parts intellectual and thrilling. It is very rare to see these qualities merge together in such a perfect way and that's why I love this book. I may be a little late to the Crichton party, but I feel if everything he wrote is like this then I now consider myself a big fan. I can't wait till I pick up another slow and dense tome so that I can check out the rest of his work half way through. 5/5",en

¡Que genialidad! Me encanta Jurassic Park y cuando vi este libro en la biblioteca me lo secuestré. La mejor decisión de mi vida (ha!)Dejando la película a un lado con todos sus efectos visuales, sonido y otros menesteres, el libro es pretty cool. Sí, tiene muchas explicaciones, muchos detalles, muchas conversaciones teóricas acerca de la tecnología que utilizan, la genética, la teoría del caos, y obviamente dinosaurios. Pero se lee fácil, sigues el hilo, no me sentí perdida y fui conectando con la historia.Primero que nada, Grant, el paleontólogo protagonista tiene nervios de acero. En el momento que se hace cargo de los niños, no grita, no chilla, no entra en pánico, no los zarandea cuando se ponen tercos, mantiene la calma, es inhumano. Pareciese que nada le afecta. Se asusta, claro que sí, pero al momento siguiente está como si nada, solo un poco sudado.De los niños Tim es super inteligente, es muy listo y muy valiente. (C'mon, el chico prácticamente les salva el culo a todos.) Conserva la calma (cuando puede) e intenta proteger a su hermana, Lex, de sí misma supongo. Lex si es posible, es mucho más chillona que en la película. Resulta un profundo contraste con Grant y Tim que parecen tener todo bajo control. Lex, para tener ocho años, es un milagro viviente. Prácticamente tiene un cartel de neón que grita ¡Aquí estooooy! ¿Quéee esperaaan para devooraarmee?. Se asusta fácilmente, lo que es comprensible, no le gusta ser mangoneada, lo que es comprensible, es terca, caprichosa, contestona. Y por eso me sorprende que Grant no la haya zarandeado un poco. Eso, no es comprensible. Ellie, la botánica? herbóloga? no me acuerdo, no aparece mucho. Pero está bien. Me encanta Ian Malcolm. Un sabelotodo, muy inteligente que predice con exactitud lo que le pasará a ese parque y aun así no puede concebir la magnitud de todo eso, hasta que lo ve. Me encanta. (view spoiler)[Y por eso me sorprendió que muriera al final, no lo esperaba. (hide spoiler)]Hammond, dios, esa rata engreída.

1231,526270,1783449418,it was amazing,"This was a re-read after 7 years. I remember enjoying it, but not that it was this good. I raced through the book, never willing to put it down. Crichton manages to make the story gripping and thrilling all the way through, even during the sciency parts.The story is very plot driven, without much character development. Every character has a certain set of skills (the hunter, the doctor, the technician, the computer nerd…). However, you do end up caring for them. The characters serve to move the story forward, and their likeability makes you curious about what is going to happen. The lack of character development wasn’t a problem for me.There were a few issues. Malcolm started to get a bit on my nerves at times, getting too preachy near the end. This book is written for a decently intelligent audience, concerning all the DNA and computer related things. Readers who follow that can also figure out the ‘moral’ of the story without it being spelled out to them. What makes Crichton’s books so good is that its believable and scientifically accurate. In general, because here were a few errors made. Most can probably be accounted to out-dated knowledge, but some things are just very wrong. It is for example said that all the dinosaurs in the park are female because: You probably know that all vertebrate embryos are inherently female. We all start life as females. It takes some kind of added effect – such as a hormone at the right moment during development – to transform the growing embryo into a male. But left to its own devices, the embryo will naturally become female. This is true… in the case for mammals, not all vertebrate embryos. For birds (which dinosaurs seem to be the closest related to) it is not well known how the development works, but it is known that their chromosomes are different from mammals. In birds, the male (ZZ) is homozygous, instead of the mammal female chromosome. The sex of reptiles is often determined by the temperature at which the egg develops. Many fish and amphibian species are able to change sex during their life. I had expected a bit better from the scientists in this story, being some of the best in their field. A few very basic mistakes were made.These errors were not enough to take away the huge enjoyment I had reading this book. I am so happy I finally picked this book up again. It was an amazing, fascinating and thrilling ride.",en

Woman inherits the earth.""As a person who has been obsessed with all things Jurassic Park since I was a kid, it's a little surprising that this was my first time reading the book! But, in a way, I'm glad I waited until now because I think I appreciated it way more and was able to take in all of the info. Because wow it's a LOT OF SCIENCE.The first thing to know is that this isn't actually super closely tied to the movie. Sure, the characters and many major scenes are the same, but the book provides so. much. more. It's just on a much grander scale. More (and more complex) characters, more background, more of the science explaining how much of this is even possible, additional twists and turns, and more plot and subplot in general.I ate this book up like a raptor eats a piece of meat. DEVOURED. SAVORED. Lol sorry that was a gross simile but I couldn't resist. I honestly just loved it. And listening to the audiobook enhanced the experience. It's captivating and so intense (especially when you get about halfway through to the end). Once everything goes to shit, the action doesn't stop and it's SO MUCH FUN. It's a wild ride.Wowow do I love Grant, Ellie, Tim, and Lex. I cheered them on the whole book. And I loved to hate some of the characters, too (a few of the characters you hate are much different from the movie, too!). And tHE DINOSAURS. So much love. They were everything. Ruthless and terrifying and amazing. Some of the scenes with the dinosaurs are so chilling! Crichton knows how to write a gripping and scary scene, that's for certain.Also, the messages portrayed in this book are AWESOME. The tangents Malcolm went on just made me want to stand up and clap because he's so right.""The planet has survived everything, in its time. It will certainly survive us.""""Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.""Many of the parts that didn't make it into the movie are my favorites and I didn't expect that! I was so pleasantly surprised by this book. I knew I was gonna love it but I didn't know I was gonna love it quite so much. Crichton put so much work and research and detail into this book and it's awe-inspiring. All fans of sci-fi and thrillers should read this book. It's great. This is now one of my very favorites.",en
1233,526270,1810978545,it was amazing,"Just in case you are unaware of what Jurassic Park is about... Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist, and graduate student Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist, are both at the top of their fields. On a dig in Montana Grant is about to make the find of his life: a whole skeleton of a baby velociraptor. Multi-billionaire and founder of InGen Technologies, John Hammond has been building a state of the art ""nature preserve"" on a private island off the coast of Costa Rica. His company has been funding Dr. Grant's dig for several years and asks both Dr. Grant and Ellie to come visit the park for a weekend consultation. On the way they are joined by Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and one of the leading minds on Chaos Theory. Malcolm has already predicted that the park is doomed to fail based on mathematics that nature can't be controlled. Once they all arrive on the island the group finds out that InGen scientists have done the impossible: they've found a way to extract and clone dinosaur DNA. Creatures extinct for eons now roam the park, which is scheduled to open to the public in a few short months. That is, until something goes horribly wrong.Jurassic Park is a modern science fiction classic and one of my favorite Crichton novels. This is one of those rare books that, having seen the movie many times and read the novel before, I still get that thrilling, edge of your seat experience on a reread. Crichton creates a wonderful mystery around what exactly is being kept in Hammond's nature preserve with a lovely, slow build up to the introduction of the dinosaurs themselves. Then tensions mount as the group of visitors begin their tour of the park and you just know things are going to go horribly, horribly wrong. Once that happens then you better hang on for quite the thrill ride!This story is interesting as it's hard to decide who to root for. The dinos are both the hero and villains of the story as are several of the humans. Crichton does his homework well. He mixes just enough facts (which are dated by this point but still reasonably relevant) with the fiction to make the story believable. He tends to get a little preachy with Malcolm's character, though I don't think the message behind it is a bad one. Have some respect for nature. Life always finds a way.",en
1234,526270,1636441535,did not like it,"The movie was much better. There were so many things that just didn't make sense. The little t-rex stalks Grant and the children? WTF for? They're tiny and there's an abundance of other prey available that would probably come more naturally to the dino. Lex is a little kid and whines a lot, but I'd bet that even for a little kid, getting attacked by a T-Rex would be enough to send you crying for your mommy (or poppy). After horribly traumatic events, she seems to be fine moments latter. Really? And then there's Hammond. I get that he cares about the success of his park more than anything, but he doesn't seem the least bit concerned when the tour, along with his grand kids, GOES MISSING and isn't accounted for for, what, 24 hours?! Everyone is like, 'hm, the cameras will pick 'em up. Well, the cars seem to be destroyed, the t-rex has broken out of it's section, but the cameras will pick them up. ... It's the next day and still no sign of them. do da doooo. Let's send Muldoon out to get the T-Rex back in its pen because that's more important than finding my grand kids. Sound good to every one?' Then, throughout all the chaos, there's still guards and other employees milling about? Wouldn't people have consolidated after the power goes out and people get killed? And then at the end, Grant want to find and count the raptor eggs? ""It has to be done."" Well guess what dude, you don't get it done. At one point he goes on about how little he knows about dinosaurs because you really can't know that much about them from just studying their millions-of-years-old remains, but hey, he could tell that that baby raptor over there must have hatched in April, pinpointing the month! And he'll go on about different biological phenomena that have nothing to do with dinos, like relating how bees communicate with ""dance""/movement to how the raptors are sitting in their den. Seems like Crichton just inserts random sciencey stuff to show that hey, he knows what he's talking about, but it's usually just fluff. There were a few moments, like some of the things Malcolm says on his drug-induced rants, that were interesting ... but just a few. Enjoy the movie. Skip the book.",en
1235,526270,1371452854,liked it,"This book was a really awesome ride. I had a couple of problems with it but honestly the whole thing was just super enjoyable and I'm really glad I picked this book up. My main complaint would have to be that I felt Crichton didn't make enough effort to create vivid depictions of all his characters, meaning that I would often mix people up or picture them completely different to what they were later described as (I thought Wu was an elderly man, Hammond was middle-aged and Lex was a teenager for the longest time). This isn't necessarily a bad thing though - it was kind of cool to be able to create my own versions of the characters, but it did prove confusing on many occasions.I loved the time that was dedicated to taking us through all the science in the beginning, and I think this book truly helped me realise how big of a nerd I am - Crichton could have talked about DNA and all that stuff for the entire book and I don't think I'd have minded. However, when the action started that was equally as entertaining. I will say that when things started really taking off, to me there was a lot of (minor) plot holes, character inconsistencies and pacing issues (I'm finding it hard to pinpoint the specific climax...). I also could have done with more detail on the dinosaurs and -never thought I'd say this - more violence. When the characters kept getting into near-death situations but always making it out OK I almost stopped worrying about them and if it had gone on much longer I probably would've done. (view spoiler)[Nedry (hide spoiler)]'s death was disgusting, yes, but it was also awesome, and - judge me all you like - I wish there had been more stuff like that.So, yeah, I definitely had my issues with this book but it was very enjoyable and a worthwhile read. Despite my confusion over the characters I still came out with connections to many of them, particularly Ellie and Grant, and most of all Malcolm. I loved hearing everything he had to say and his attitude brought a lot of humour to the book for me. The audiobook, narrated by Scott Brick, was very entertaining too.

1236,526270,2315850455,it was amazing,"Dinosaurs and their correlated scientific discoveries, apropos of the truthful facts of its existence in this world, have never been rejected by scientists around the globe. They are the ones who will continue tirelessly making multitudinous efforts to uncover myriad species of these prehistoric creatures, which have become, to some people, their preeminent cause of lifelong marveling and consternation, while others, videlicet, the people who belong to various religious groups, whose majority denizens fell adequately at the other end of the spectrum, frivolously oblivious to science, let alone dinosaurs, that to them are purely non-existent, chimerical parable and unimaginatively dismissing the topic altogether as childish. Jurrasic Park auspiciously conjured up a thrilling reading experience, which greatly instigated and enlivened our fascination with these primitive savage beasts, despite the multifarious incomprehensibilities we still cannot fathom regarding its true nature and inner workings. The story moved at a breakneck fleeting pace, thanks to the complimentarily efficacious cliffhangers posted at the end of each chapter which has managed to perpetuate the suspense, until the very last page. Spielberg's movie has captured the audiences with the effective use of CGI and similarly petrifying finagle, keeping the audiences always at the edge of their seats. The novel is no different. The author had cogitated an equivalently, if not better, thrill ride of outlandish adventure experience through his simplistic storytelling technique, laced with punctilious matter-of-fact theories of his own creation regarding the mechanics of his natural world inhabited by numerous terrifyingly realistic primordial monsters, left us all feeling supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, and filled with nothing but awe for the fantastical renderings of the characters in this book. All in all, if you have watched the movie, as I am sure, most of you did already watch it anyway, give this novel a read, for it is a lively story which will enrich your savoir-faire sophisticated knowledge of dinosaurs, and be inordinately appreciated by hardcore fans of the prodigious animals.",en

I saw it in the theaters on opening weekend and was mesmerized by the spectacle that Steven Spielberg and company had made. Upon its release on VHS, my parents bought me the tape and I played it over and over again, quickly memorizing the movie word for word. With how much I loved - and still love - the movie, it's a wonder that I never read the book until now.I am amazed to say that the book is even way better than the movie! It's more serious in tone, the science is exceptionally more believable, has more depth and the danger is even more pervasive. The characters are different from the movie, most notably mathematician Ian Malcolm, who was my personal favorite. Every piece of dialog that he had in the book made me take note. There was a depth and thought provoking sense to every line he had that brought a reality to what he was saying at all times. His speech about Chaos Theory in particular was a highlight of the novel and the subsequent ways the theory plays into the story. At its core, JURASSIC PARK is a cautionary tale, in the same vein as Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN: just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should. That line of thinking is something we should consider in this day and age of vigorously, and always, attempting to push the boundaries into increasingly dangerous scientific studies (atom smashing, human cloning etc.) As these fictional cautionary tales bleed over into the possibility of reality in today's world, it makes JURASSIC PARK and FRANKENSTEIN that much more relevant. These stories have a lasting appeal because there is an undeniable truth to their ultimate message that says we should perhaps back off from playing a great creator and manipulator of life. Nature and the natural progression of things should sometimes just be left alone. This is a book that I will definitely revisit in the future; it is fantastic and without question a modern day classic that will live on for decades to come. I give this one a 5/5! ",en

If this happens to you with Jurassic Park, just regard them with pity. Maybe pat their head. Simply put, the movie negated the book’s reason for existence, hence the reason for the low score. I feel a bit bad giving it a 2 because it’s such a great idea for a story and the book pulls off the action well, but it’s simply not as good as the movie. Reading it after watching Jurassic Park feels like you got your hands on an early copy of the screenplay. If you love Jurassic Park the film, go on, give this a read. There are some interesting additions and deviations. The opening of the book I actually found far superior to the opening of the movie. (Apparently I was not alone as it was co-opted for the opening of Jurassic Park II) Also, there’s a fun action sequence in the aviary with pterodactyls that Spielberg obviously couldn’t even begin to fund. That said, he replaced it with the much cheaper ‘raptors in the kitchen’ scene for the movie which is one of the most fantastic suspenses in cinematic history so it’s 6 on one hand and half a dozen on the other. I think the thing that most put me off the book was Malcolm. The book made me realize that Jeff Goldblum is a genius. Without him there, actually delivering Malcolm’s lines (just picturing him won’t do), the character goes from palaeontology rockstar to self righteous whinger. This was a quite distressing shift for my favourite character to undergo, and subsequently I never really forgave the novel.

1240,526270,627507350,it was amazing,"I think there's a specific reason to explain why this book gained so a massive success all over the world. It presents a well told, original, intriguing story about of the most impressive subject of Earth sciences: dinosaurs. Even if the theory presented by Crichton is fantascientific rather than scientific idea (once I read an article about the real possibility to find paleo-DNA in the fossils and to use it to build a dinosaur just as showed in the movie, but it was obviously scientifically inaccurate!) let us abandon ourselves into the suspension of disbelief: we'll be wrapped in a story that mounts from page to page, till the great revelation, then to the catastrophic event that lead to the end of the tale. As the visitors of the park we think that everything in it is wonderfull, because it comes from an epoch so ancient that it is quite impossible for us to quantify it. When we - with the eyes of Alan Grant or with the eyes of the little Tim - look at this incredible ecosystem with all its beauty and feeling of antiquity (something like nostalgia), we forget that those creature have the same instincts of an animal that lives nowadays somewhere in the world: breath, eat, hunt, defence, reproduction. In this way we are terrorized by the violence of the Tyrannosaurs and we are horrified by the Velociraptor. All and all, the tale is successfull in leaving the sensation that, wild as it probably was, the lost world of the Mesozoic should have been a show for our eyes. I deem that Jurassic Park, far from being the right description of the dinosaurs presented, is a novel that must be read by all the people who like a solid, dynamic and never boring story, with a sufficient scientific background.If I can, I recommend to take the scientific ideas proposed by the author as the general opinion about the mesozoic ecosystems (in all their aspects) of the mid 70-80 and, thus, totally outmoded.

I think that has something to do with the timing and pacing of this book. A lot of it was very intense but I didn't realise I was reading the climax of the book until it was already over and they were (view spoiler)[blowing up the island (hide spoiler)]! Another thing that stopped me from really getting into the story were the characters. I did really love Tim, Grant and Ellie (and Tina even though she was only in the book for the tiniest part!) but most of the characters were confusing. They were all introduced at the same point pretty much and few of them had defining characteristics. I got very confused on who was who and I still can't tell you much about a lot of the characters.Related to this problem is the fact that when ever someone died (in case you hadn't already guessed, it all goes wrong!) there was no time for either the characters or the reader to grieve. The characters didn't react much at all even when it was people they liked that died and so I didn't feel anything either. And these weren't just people dying in their sleep, these were people getting viciously attacked by dinosaurs. My favourite parts were the action portions. They were simultaneously terrifying and awesome. The velociraptors in particular were creeeepy! Tim was extremely brave and clever for multiple points in this book.

So in preparation for another couple hours of watching man against dinosaur, I thought it was about time to finally read the original book. I wasn’t expecting all the scientific details. I get why they were there, but it took up a rather large chunk of the book. There was much more in the book than the movie (totally understandable), so I had to get used to that. I did keep wondering when the dinosaurs were going to show up. I was ready to dive into the stories of the “clever girl.” But it was still really good! For the number of changes they made from the book to the movie, I agree with some of them, but there were some pretty intense moments in the book (which I noticed showed up in the third movie). The movie still captured the essence of the story though and I was okay without seeing the deaths of some people as described in the book…ew!A few more thoughts – Lex is even more annoying in the book. Good grief! This next sentence might be a bit of a spoiler, but Hammond isn’t the sweet grandpa the movie made him out to be, plus he dies at the end…say what? And sadly so does Dr. Malcolm.

Crichton's prose is absolutely atrocious, the characters are mostly all awful people, and there's so much bad conflicting with the good that it's hard to see the light. One positive thing is that Hammond is so much more of a arrogant libertarian blowhard villain than he is in the film. But there's so much else that's worse. There's absolutely huge swaths of the book devoted to computer systems and lengthy pseudointellectual argument between Malcolm and Hammond about chaos theory, and it's one of those arguments where by the end of it, you just want both people to shut up and be eviscerated by dinosaurs. At first I was madly irritated with the lengthy prologue, which is devoted to tale after tale of subtle dinosaurs attacking people around Isla Nublar, but in retrospect, I have to grant a little leeway at this point, because it's not as if dinosaur-theme-park fiction was a trope at this point.The one large credit I have to give the book, is that the central conceit, while not necessarily original, is well thought out and interesting. I mean, the simplicity of the name says it all. Jurassic Park. It's a great idea, the rest of the novel pretty much writes itself at that point. When I was 17, I thought the film could have included a lot more of the book and still been stellar, but reading it now, I feel like almost every change from the book made by Spielberg and Co was an excellent decision.Anyway.

I've decided to read Jurassic Park and The Lost World back-to-back, eager to see if the texts will surpass what I loved about the (first) film. The book is a good read, but pales in comparison to what Steven Speilberg was able to do using Crichton's vision as source material. Jurassic Park as a novel is often clunky, especially when Crichton is punctuating pages with his trademark science/tech lingo (in most of these pages via mathematician Ian Malcolm), though from a genetic standpoint, the questions posed are, as always, thought provoking. It's just very difficult to go from Malcolm explaining the basis for chaos theory, to being suddenly hunted by a T-rex with two small children in tow. It's almost as if the plot gets in the way of what Crichton really wants to do: examine and explain his theories in an hypothetical setting. The novel also suffers from sub par characterization, a common trait in Crichton's work. But all the major action pieces from the movie are present, and they are very entertaining. Much of what has been shaved from the book for the film makes sense, including the ending which felt like a leftover plot point. ",en
1245,526270,334680313,it was amazing,"This is Crichton's gem, even better, I think, than Andromeda Strain. And because I'd seen the movie I'd never read the book! What a mistake. The basic premise: scientists clone dinosaurs to create a giant theme park on a tropical island, and the scheme turns into a nightmare - but a thrilling, incredibly imaginative, and frighteningly believable nightmare. It's one of the most imaginative novels ever written. The book is actually better than the movie, exploring more deeply the ethical debate about scientists tinkering with the DNA of living things for scientific curiosity and profit (but not in a stogy way). The book makes it clear that if these things were actually possible, someday somebody is going to do them. Not necesarily a dinosaur theme park, but all kinds of cloning/genetic engineering schemes. This book was written before scientists started cloning sheep, cattle, dogs and other mammals (with high rates of failure in terms of deformities and early deaths that get hidden.This book was also written before the now-discussed (and feared) specter of genetically engineering 'designer children' started to become feasible. What amazing foresight and...warning...went into this work. If you've seen the movie, definitely read the book. It's even better than the movie!",en
1246,526270,1320769963,it was amazing,"Well, I obviously saw the movie before reading the book - I wasn't even born when the book came out. This was my favorite movie growing up, my sister would be begging my mom to watch Disney movies and I would beg to watch Jurassic Park. I had my paleontologist phase just like any other girl my age, until I found out what the actually entailed. I was obsessed with this movie. However, I only read the book now. You can imagine I had really high hopes for it and it did not let me down.It was great, super original plot and, like most cases, it included a lot more information than the movie. I still think the movie is better, though. There's something about dinosaurs in amusement parks that you just need to see it, reading about it is not enough. I did love the writing and the pace of the story. It had the right amount of action, background information and realness. The author really made me believe that it was possible for something like that to happen (which I know it isn't ). I loved this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who liked the movie. You don't need to be a hardcore fiction fan to enjoy it. For more book reviews and other bookish things: www.letmecrossover.blogspot.com",en
1247,526270,1683767629,really liked it,"I loved this book. And I loved it because I took it for what it was: a fast-paced read, minus the science and philosophy rambling, with dinosaurs. I read a few comments from other paleoarch folks -- my degree was strictly archaeology, but I digress -- and I totally agree. Grant wouldn't be breaking off bits of bone in his dig if he's this experienced. We wouldn't be tossing aside broken bones because no bone is useless. But hey. I didn't really care as I was reading. I loved the movie back in the day, and the book just heightened my sense of nostalgia while also giving me a new perspective on a lot of plot elements the movie left out.Crichton's style was appealing too. Sometimes you just need to read a book that isn't weighed down by too much of anything, and this was that book for me. I'm interested in trying more of his pieces in the future to see if it was just a fluke that I enjoyed this on a story I already knew, or if I genuinely want more of his work.I took off a star because of all the huge science and philosophy discussions. I enjoyed them to a degree, but after a while I just wanted to get back to the action, not feel like I was back in a social anthropology lecture with horrendously dry assigned readings.",en
1248,526270,106608113,liked it,"So I read this on my roommate's recommendation. I've read and enjoyed a couple Crichton books before, so I wasn't too hard to convince. And before, during, and after I read it, we kept getting into the Which-Is-better-between-the-book-and-the-movie discussion. He claims the book is better because of the added scientific explanations and more in-depth storyline. But here's why he's wrong: Crichton doesn't write interesting characters. Because he had more time, he is able to flesh out his characters more than a movie should, but they are still less memorable than the movie characters. They all seem to talk in a similar tone and rhythm... it's like Crichton is acting out a dinosaur adventure story with puppets and using his own voice for all of them. Also, the book seems WAY more contrived than the movie. Granted, he's not writing nonfiction here, but the dinosaurs magically seem to get distracted/killed/tranquilized just when they're about to eat a main character. EVERY TIME!That said, this is a very fun book. The science is fascinating, and the story is quite exciting. But it's not as good as the movie, because there are infinitely more good books than there are good movies. The competition's just much stiffer in literature. ",en

Though that would probably be cool. Would the [small:] amount of dialogue already in Spanish be in Spanish, or in English or something else?)Still a fun read after all these years. Haven't read it since I was in sixth or seventh grade, and it's still awesome. The writing is clean as it gets, with some remarkably memorable visceral imagery. Of course, what drives it is the plot, which is still exhilarating even when you know the entire plot from before. Malcolm is still a fantastic character, and the ending is as bittersweet as always. Because, yes, the dinosaurs were a danger to humans as well as the ecosystem in general, but watching them all engulfed in a fireball still tugs at the proverbial heartstrings. To be cover-blurb worthy, it is a rousing read that both entertains and makes you think--about progress and what it can do if gone unchecked. ",en

It is similar to the movie - which I am a huge fan of - but is definitely different enough to hold your interest. There's a lot of science mumbo jumbo which I admittedly didn't understand half of, but it was fascinating all the same & I'm sure they dumbed down the science as best they could. I was greatly amused by all the computer talk, as computers have changed just so, so much in the last twenty five years. I definitely got my geek on reading this book! I wasn't enough finished reading this one, and I had already requested the next one from the library.It's ironic, too, because I remember when the movie first came out, I tried getting through the book & hated it - I hated all the science and computer talk, and that was what amused me so much this read through.I just couldn't believe how confident everyone was throughout the book, just so damned smug that they knew what they were doing - and then the dinosaur ate them. Good times.Definitely a must read for dinosaur fans! ",en
1251,526270,1283458462,really liked it,"Having enjoyed several of Crichton's books in the past, I still avoided this one because having seen the movie several times, I just didn't see the point. Audible recently came out with a new edition read by Scott Brick and I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. The plot is similar to the movie (but not in every detail). The characters are better developed. Pretty much the same characters are present, some of the relationships are different.The theme of the commercialization of science is the driving motivation of the book. This element is defiantly present in the movie, but I had a much better understanding of John Hammond's worldview after reading the book. I realized that thus far I've spoken of the book in terms of it's relationship to the movie. I guess I have assumed most people have seen the movie.But a couple of comments regarding the book on it's own merit.The plot is well developed. The science maybe pseudo, but it is very believable. There are some really scary parts, that I just had to finish before I could take a break from the book. It is a fun read!",en

I was obsessed with the movie as a kid but not until I traveled to Costa Rica did it occur to me that I should read the book!This is a great vacation read, with extra points if you're in Costa Rica (though it makes the strange sounds you hear at night and in the jungle a little creepier). It's simple but suspenseful even if you've seen the movie a dozen times. As usual, the book is better than the movie, but I think I would have liked it more if i hadn't seen the movie just for the shock factor.It has been awhile since I saw the movie, but I think the little girl is the older sibling and the computer badass. The book writes her as being whiny and useless the whole time, so kudos to Spielberg and the movie writers for fixing that. Also, Dr. Sattler isn't mentioned too much and at the beginning it's all about her legs. Oh, the early 90s.Fan of the movie? You should read it.

They said I Laughed when the T-Rex ate the lawyer off the toilet and smiled when I saw the raptors attack. But i digress...anyways This book was great. As always Crichton has his ramblings about scientific theory's. But they never seem irrelevant to the plot in Jurassic park. I found the book to be much more engaging than the film ( which i still love). The book just has more suspense and just more going on than just "" Oh my gosh the dinosaurs are loose"". The pacing of the books is good and it flows nice. My only complaint is the characters are very flat to me. Most exist to be eaten by the endless amount of hungry dinosaurs. Their interactions mostly consist of people saying how awesome the park is and how things cant go wrong. Then Ian explaining why they are stupid and how things are going to go wrong. Still for me it was a page turner. If your interest lie in this direction you should give this book a read.",en

I became so enthralled in my re-read that I ended up ditching my ebook in favor of an ebook of Jurassic Park as well (I didn't want to bring the sandy beach book into my bed, haha). Even 26 years later, Crighton's sci-fi thriller holds up remarkably well. The pseudo science is just plausible enough, the dinosaurs are terrifying, and Lex is way less annoying than the film version.Edited to add: I don't remember if I had children yet the last time I read this. If so, they were tiny. This time around, my son is 10 and my daughter is 7, so I kept imagining them as Tim and Lex. This was highly disturbing. :/",en

I like both renditions but the book really fleshed out the plot where the movie didn't possibly have the time or resources to do so. If you have watched the movie, for all intense purposes, much of the plot was identical. There was one character that never showed up in the movie that played a role, albeit not a large role, in the book. Some characters that died in the movie lived in the book and vice versa but there was more exposition where there were no attacks by the dinosaurs but the dinosaurs got much farther afield in the book than they did in the movie. The book was interesting, fun and gruesome at times but a real treat to experience for the first time. Reccommended.",en

It had a lot more detail than the movie and I found Crichton's writing style to be very detailed and scientific while at the same time accessible. It was definitely plot-centered which usually isn't my cup of tea but it moved quickly and had enough character development to keep even the character-driven reader going. One complaint I had, specifically about this (2012) edition, is the ridiculous number of typos, they increased as the book went on and towards the end seemed to surface every ten pages-- from ""Dr. Saltier"" to the ""bonking"" hadrosaurs, I think that the editors at Ballantine should be ashamed of themselves!",en

Lot's of great quotes -“In the information society, nobody thinks. We expected to banish paper, but we actually banished thought.” “Discovery is always rape of the natural world. Always.” “God created dinosaurs. God destroyed dinosaurs. God created Man. Man destroyed God. Man created dinosaurs.

Sin embargo, excepto algún personaje, la mayoría o sobran o están caracterizados de una manera muy regular. De hecho, excepto la primera escena con el rex, los personajes se muestran muy apáticos ante lo que están viviendo. Y el hecho de que los ""malos"" son muy estúpidos (sobretodo Hammond, que es el súmmum de la estupidez).
