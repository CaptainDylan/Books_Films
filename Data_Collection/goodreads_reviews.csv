1296,5366869,really liked it,"The thing that strikes me most about her work is that every time there's a new discovery about how paleolithic people lived, it goes along with her stories. Things they said were silly back when she wrote it (Neanderthals with instruments, Neanderthals living with homo sapiens sapiens, and the like) keep proving true. She presents interesting ideas of cognition, culture and how societies develop. The first two books are her best I think. The rest remain interesting if you can deal with the constant repetition, soft core porn and the fact that Ayla discovers everything but cold fusion. Clan of the Cave Bear is an incredible, courageous story. The author spent a lot of time hanging out with some of the world's most noted paleontologists doing her research- and she knows her stuff!"
1296,154124473,it was ok,"Ms Auel, there are some things I’d like to talk to you about. Be warned I’m quite angry because I keep reading your books for some bizarre reason and I cringe and tear my hair out in despair. See, you had a good story there – a little Cro-Magnon orphan girl found and raised by Neanderthals. I didn’t even care she turned out to be the smartest, most beautiful, ingenious little thing and the villain in the story was almost grotesque and cartoonish in his evildoing. I knew no real harm would ever come Ayla’s way, she would survive it all and meanwhile invent an iPhone. It’s all ok, it’s comfort reading after all. It’s the writing I had many different problems with. First of all – point of view. ""The plentiful supply of drinking water kept dehydration from making its dangerous contribution to hypothermia, the lowering of body temperature that brought death from exposure, but she was getting weak.""I’m sorry, what? It’s 35000 BC, I don’t want to hear things like ‘hypothermia’ or ‘diuretic’ or ‘evolution’. I didn’t need that foreshadowing of the 20th century. I wanted a story as seen through the eyes of prehistorical people and I’d seriously take anything the author threw my way, there would be no limits to my suspension of disbelief. But since I had that constant running commentary that sounded like something from a BBC documentary I was forced to get out the story and look at it from a dispassionate, modern point of view, which inevitably led me to the conclusion that half of it was unbelievable bollocks. ""All those primitive people, with almost no frontal lobes, and speech limited by undeveloped vocal organs, but with huge brains—larger than any race of man then living or future generations yet unborn—were unique. They were the culmination of a branch of mankind whose brain was developed in the back of their heads, in the occipital and the parietal regions that control vision and bodily sensation and store memory.""No! You can’t put paragraphs like that in a STORY! Did you copy it from an encyclopedia? You're confusing research with copy-pasting.The narrative finally jumped the shark when it implied that Neanderthal women were scared of learning new things because with their hereditary memory (yeah, me neither) their children would keep having larger and larger heads which eventually would lead to more difficult births and higher infant and mother mortality rate, ergo decline of the race and evolutionary cul-de-sac. No, I’m serious. And here is why Broud (the villain) hates Ayla:""but the real problem was she was not Clan. […] Her brain followed different paths, her full, high forehead that housed forward-thinking frontal lobes gave her an understanding from a different view.""Yes. He hated her because of her forward-thinking frontal lobes. But when Auel gives the voice to Ayla, her stream of conscience is even worse than the droning of the main narrator. It’s like listening to someone on amphetamines. ""I’ll dig some roots on the way back. Iza says the roots are good for Creb’s rheumatism, too. I hope the fresh cherry bark will help Iza’s cough. She’s getting better, I think, but she’s so skinny. Uba’s getting so big and heavy, Iza shouldn’t lift her at all. Maybe I’ll bring Uba with me next time, if I can. I’m so glad we didn’t have to give her to Oga. She’s really starting to talk now. It’ll be fun when she gets a little bigger and we can go out together. Look at those pussy willows. Funny how they feel like real fur when they’re small like that, but they grow out green. The sky is so blue today. I can smell the sea in the wind. I wonder when we’ll be going fishing. The water should be warm enough to swim in soon. I wonder why no one else likes to swim? The sea tastes salty, not like the stream, but I feel so light in it. I can hardly wait until we go fishing. I think I love sea fish best of all, but I like eggs, too.""Second – repetitions. For god’s sake. I know we homo sapiens sapiens don’t have as good memory as Neanderthals but I’m pretty sure your average human doesn’t need to have a piece of information repeated every five pages. This book could easily be 150 pages without losing anything. A perfect candidate for Reader’s Digest’s condesations.Another problem – showing… and then telling. Because we all readers are completely dumb and we don’t get it.""I see you and Dorv put your slings to good use. I could smell the meat cooking halfway up the hill,” Brun continued. “When we get settled in the new cave, we’ll have to find a place to practice. The clan would benefit if all the hunters had your skill with the sling, Zoug. And it won’t be long before Vorn will need to be trained.” The leader was aware of the contribution the older men still made to the sustenance of the clan and wanted them to know it.”Why was that last sentence needed? This is exactly what the dialogue implied! Ms. Auel, are you disrespecting me?We know that Ayla doesn’t remember ever seeing any humans that look like her, only Neanderthals, so it’s obvious she would have body image problems, feel ugly, big, deformed. It’s implied many times but just in case we don’t understand why a tall, slim, blue-eyed blond girl might feel ugly, Auel explains, repeatedly: ""For as long as she could remember, Ayla had never seen anyone except people of the clan. She had no other standard of measure. They had grown accustomed to her, but to herself, she looked different from everyone around her, abnormally different.""On top of that all sort of other random nonsense.""She simply hadn’t been able to grasp the concept of talking with movement. That it was even possible had never occurred to her; it was totally beyond her realm of experience.""Really? She invents pretty much anything and understand calculus but has never seen anyone gesticulate? That’s almost second nature to every human. If you meet someone who speaks a different language and you try to communicate with them, you almost automatically resort to gestures, so don’t even give me that bullshit. Yet another problem was that Auel obviously confused description with enumerations. It’s not that there were too many descriptions in this book; it’s that they were all boring. She even managed to make those little Neanderthal Olympic Games sound boring. I’d love for someone to pay me to rewrite this whole thing.And there were NO sexy scenes in this volume! I am almost ashamed to admit that I also read book two, and it was only around page 30 of the book three that I managed to snap out of it and decided I just couldn’t do it any longer. It was like crack, it was ruining my life. "
1296,2363274186,it was amazing,"Omg!! This book was awesome!! I hope I get to read the rest of the series. I might buy them for myself for my B-Day! Yes, there were some parts but there always seem to have those in books I read! Still loved!! Happy Reading! Mel 🖤"
1296,2157559647,really liked it,"This was a great pick! I thoroughly enjoyed this read! Set during prehistoric times, Ayla’s Home and her family are lost to a devastating earthquake. Homeless and alone she wanders the land, barely surviving, until she is found by Iza - a member of The Clan. Ayla struggles to fit in and to be accepted by The Clan, its customs foreign to her. Their treatment of women being the main hurdle - all women are below men in status, expected to cook for the men, never to ignore a direct order from a man and certainly never allowed to hunt! As time progresses The Clan become accustomed to the different girl, and she integrates. But not everyone is so understanding- Broud, the son of the Clan leader hates Ayla fiercely and will do whatever necessary to bring her down! With some scenes slightly shocking, I couldn’t stop turning the pages!This novel was full of vivid descriptions, including the way cave people lived - their local sources of food, clothing and intricate belief system. A wonderful selection of characters, I was reminded of the Disney film ‘Brother Bear’ where each Clan member has a spirit totem, in the form of an animal - I was fully engrossed in this world, and look forward to continuing it."
1296,1070178043,really liked it,"I once read an article from National Geographic in which the author had spent some time living with a Stone Age tribe in Africa. The people were a studied anachronism, living in modern times, but within a carefully maintained atavistic society of hunting and gathering. Most endearing of this study was the author’s observations about the interactive dialogue amongst the members of the tribe. One wife would say to her husband, “another woman has three beads, I only have two, I wish I had a husband who could work hard and provide.” Another would say to his young son, “is that how you skin a kill? Here let me show you how it is done.” Human nature does not change.And so we come to Jean Auel’s magnificent anthropological narrative of a young Cro-Magnon girl orphaned by her family and raised by a group of Neanderthals. This read like a study of the group, similar to Jared Diamond or Thor Heyerdahl, where she is an omnipresent and omniscient narrator of the life and times of Ayla as she grows up with the clan of Neanderthals, close relatives of humans, but distinct and different. Auel masterfully creates a glimpse onto their complex social structures and group dynamics and describes Neanderthals with an instinctive, racial memory.Apart from the clearly well researched and thoughtful scientific examination of Neanderthal society, with a fairly complicated social structure and theological underpinnings, Auel also tells a fascinating story. My only criticism would be the ending, which is somewhat predictable but also truncated with a deus ex machina that wraps things up just too neatly. All in all, an excellent book that makes me want to read the other books in her Earth Children series."
1296,15569300,it was amazing,"Note, March 25, 2014: I edited this review slightly just now, to delete one accidental dittography. Hmmm, I thought I'd proofread this.... :-)Auel's Earth's Children series (this opening volume was followed by, so far, four sequels) garners mixed --and mostly negative-- reviews here on Goodreads. Though none of them have reviewed it, a dozen of my Goodreads friends have given it ratings, ranging from one star to five. Obviously, my own reaction falls at the favorable end of the spectrum.Ayla, of course, is a Cro-Magnon (i.e., an anatomically modern human; you and I are ""Cro-Magnons"" too, in that anthropological sense) orphaned by a natural disaster and raised by a clan of Neanderthals. For a writer of historical fiction, a prehistoric setting poses a challenge; technically, the genre embraces any fiction set in the past, but its authors usually depend heavily on written records for events and background material, and for the Ice Age, no such records exist. To her credit, Auel was the first writer in the genre to attempt it on a large scale (though Jack London and William Golding each wrote single novels set in prehistory), and to popularize it sufficiently to create a market niche and a subgenre tradition that other writers have begun to develop. In place of written records, she immersed herself in the exhaustive study of every known aspect of the physical evidence from the period, and all of the various scholarly interpretations of it. Her reconstruction of both Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal natural history, society and culture is of course speculative; but it is based meticulously on this research. Even the more controversial features of her Neanderthals --their ""Memories,"" a genetically-transmitted racial memory of past experiences, and their difficulty with verbal speech (and consequent preference for sign language)-- have grounds in known Neanderthal physiology, such as their hyper-developed back brains, which control memory. (Although Auel is an evolutionist, she recognizes Neanderthals as ""a branch of humanity"" and depicts them as fully human, not as the ""ape-men"" who figure in London's Before Adam or Conan Doyle's The Lost World --a point in her favor.)A weakness of Auel's writing is the converse of her strong research: she has a tendency to want to divulge every iota of erudition she has on the Ice Age world, and doesn't always seamlessly integrate it into the narrative. She also has a penchant for explicitly detailed sex, which in my estimation is not a plus. Here, however, neither of these flaws are as marked as they are in the later books (the latter because the plot here affords little occasion for it --Ayla doesn't yet have a love interest, though that gets remedied later on. :-)) IMO, her strong points outweigh these. First and foremost, she has a capacity to create fully alive, three-dimensional characters whom the reader can relate to (positively or negatively) just like real people --Iza, Creb, Brun, Broud, even several of the minor characters; and above all Ayla herself, as we watch her grow from a scared, traumatized child into a strong, highly competent and intelligent woman. Indeed, she's much too strong, competent and intelligent for some of the Clan to accept in a woman (and judging from critical and reader reactions, some moderns aren't very cool with it either! :-))That brings up another strong point of the book --Auel's intelligent engaging of serious issues that are still relevant to our lives today. Gender roles are the most obvious; against the backdrop of the male- dominated Clan, Ayla makes a lived-out case for a genuine feminism (of the equalitarian rather than male-bashing sort) that argues for social roles based on demonstrated ability and interests, not gender. But the book also addresses issues of interracial and cross-cultural relations, and the conflict between inflexible tradition and cultural inertia, represented by the change-resistant Clan (""It's never been done before!"" is leader Brun's characteristic refrain, which became a byword in our household :-)), vs. needed adaptation to changing conditions. Also, Ayla's fight to save the life of her infant son (conceived in a rape) provides a powerful pro-life message --though that may well have been unintended on Auel's part. (But as D. H. Lawrence said, ""Trust the tale and not the teller."" :-))All in all, I consider this one of the better contemporary American novels in any genre, and regard Ayla as one of the greatest fictional characters --and best female role models-- in modern literature. (The series was one that I read out loud to my wife; it also became one of her all-time favorites, and she re-reads it periodically on her own!)"
1296,1421471475,really liked it,"Circa 30,000 years ago in the lands surrounding the broad Black Sea , in future Europe, a cataclysmic event occurred, not very unusual there, but still to the superstitious Ice Age people , a devastating occurrence. A family of Cro -Magnons, the first modern humans, our direct ancestors, were wiped out, near a small river, all except a little girl named Ayla , just five, she liked to sneak away and jump joyously into the stream, at dawn, a swimmer before the child could walk. The shaking soil and rumbling sounds frightened the girl, all her relatives, inside a lean-to hut, disappeared beneath the earth, as if a giant beast swallowed them, never to be seen again. Alone, not knowing how to survive, or where to go, she wanders for days drinking the clear waters of the river, that Ayla follows, eating anything edible nearby, growing hungrier, at last, her weakened body collapses on the ground. But a small band of twenty Neanderthals, whose cave was destroyed in the earthquake too, and losing six of their members, are looking to discover another, find the child, but she is an ""Other"", a strange species they avoid, easily done, the few scattered groups of men, rarely encounter anyone else in the vast world. Iza, the wise medicine woman, feels sorry for the little girl, all alone , that nobody cares about and lifts her up, carrying the orphan away, she is saved. Brun, the bold leader of the clan, her brother, is not happy , but lets Ayla stay, her other sibling Creb, the powerful spiritual chief of the band, that the rest of the tribe is afraid of, not just because he was born deformed, he radiates menace, half his body is effected, a cripple, only a lone leg works properly, and one piercing eye, on his hideous face, these three rule the Neanderthals, and Broud, the son of Brun, the heir apparent... Maybe because the helpless girl is from a strange, mysterious, new people, Broud, takes an instant, quite insane hatred towards her, they don't resembles them, he thinks , a threat somehow, but for generations haven't been seen, until now, the Others, could compete later, for the scarce food supply, the wild animal herds that constantly roam the lonely steppes, by the cold glaciers from the north, they are always a danger too, and someday will start down again... killing everything in their path. Life is very precarious in the primitive, prehistorical times, the hunter- gatherers humans , do not survive for long, a continuous struggle, to keep warm, get an adequate amount of food and shelter, escape unknown illnesses, with no cures, safety doesn't exist, there is little compassion for strangers, especially from the ""Others"". Ayla must adopt to her new clan, The Clan of the Cave Bear, learn a different language, unfamiliar customs, pray to unseen spirits, fit in, to endure, she has no choice, but her blonde hair and tall stature, weird, unattractive face, to the rest of the band, will always remind the Neanderthals , ( less brutish and more intelligent than commonly believed ) she can never be like them...An interesting tale of an ancient, long gone era, but will we ever known how accurate this depiction is..."
1296,4632509,did not like it,"I *really* wanted to dig this book. I have a burgeoning obsession with prehistory, evolution, and the antecedents of man, and a tale of Cro Magnons and Neanderthals is exactly what I'd love to read.Sadly, this book does not contain that tale.Instead, it's a goopy mess of inane metaphysics, prurience for prurience's sake, and a none-too-subtle dollop of racism, as the blonde-haired and light-skinned heroine shows the more primitive (and darker-skinned) Neanderthals how to do--well, just about everything.This is a white man's burden fantasy writ large, and not writ very well."
1296,2495981909,it was ok,"I could easily sit between a red-faced evolutionist and a screaming creationist, both arguing around me, and quite contentedly finish any book I was reading. I'm no Louis Leakey, people. I'm no Tammy Faye Baker, either.I am, in fact, an anthropological airhead, and arguing with me about creationism or evolution is like trying to convince me to become interested in my car's transmission. Whatever the hell that is.Ain't going to happen, folks.I figure. . . if I don't personally have the ability to prove or disprove a theory (or identify a transmission), I'm just going to sit back, relax and focus on the stories.I love stories.And, since it turned out that my end-of-summer fantasy of having sex with Viggo Mortensen in a cave off of the Mediterranean Sea wasn't going to happen, I started searching for a story that would have an adventurous feel to it. And, you know. . . maybe some cave sex.Neanderthal cave sex. Now, if you're a creationist and you're getting worried about my language here, why don't we just replace the word Neanderthal for ex-boyfriends or my high school baseball team?And if you're an anthropologist and you're getting worried that I know no concrete facts about the evolution of man, I apologize for my inability to truly understand that a Neanderthal is something different from an ex-boyfriend or my high school baseball team. Everybody feeling good now? Sort of? More confused than ever?So, back to the question. . . that you never asked. . . and possibly would never even wonder . . . did I find excellent cave sex in this book of Neanderthals (or primitive man, or whatever in hell these little sloped forehead, hairy pygmies are supposed to be)?Well, does this answer your question?In this primitive society, sex was as natural and unrestrained as sleeping or eating. Children learnedas they learned other skills and customs, by observing adults, and they played at intercourse as they mimicked other activities from a young age. Often a boy who reached puberty, but had not yet made his first kill and existed in a limbo between child and adult, penetrated a girl child even before she reached menarche. Hymens were pierced young, though males were a little fearful if blood was spilled and quickly ignored the girl if it happenedAin't nothing sexy about that paragraph.Ms. Auel. . . do you understand that I've been home with my children all summer? No sleepaway camp, no evenings out on the town?Nada, lady.It's been a long, hot summer. And I don't mean sexy hot. I mean. . . damn, it's been in the 90s forever.I wanted to read about cave sex, not these little freaks.And what's with their dialogue reading like Shakespearean soliloquies, when you clearly point out that these people can't do more than grunt and move their hands in rudimentary gestures? How now, Ms. Auel?Why do the Neanderthals talk with such sophistication? And why did you need to take 10 pages to describe a green leaf (that wasn't quite green, but gray, and transparent and fluttering in the breeze, with spots on it)? Just write the word “leaf” and let's move on.Ack! I can't wait to return my copy.I'm using some hand signals right now, Ms. Auel. Can you see them?I don't like Neanderthals. They're awful. So's this book.I think I do prefer the Adam and Eve theory; they're like the Barbie and Ken of the ancient world, and I bet they had sex in a proper hotel.And, just for the record, I hope the glorious angel Gabriel flies down from Heaven on a pterodactyl some day, and lands right on a street in New York City.I feel like we'd all shut up at the same time and hum in peaceful wonder at our awesome existence.Plus, his stories would be amazing."
1296,738950301,really liked it,"The Clan of the Cave Bear, Jean M. Auel The Clan of the Cave Bear is an epic work of prehistoric fiction by Jean M. Auel about prehistoric times. It is the first book in the Earth's Children book series which speculates on the possibilities of interactions between Neanderthal and modern Cro-Magnon humans. A five-year-old girl, Ayla, whom readers come to understand is Cro-Magnon, is orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family's camp. She wanders aimlessly, naked and unable to feed herself, for several days. Having been attacked and nearly killed by a cave lion and suffering from starvation, exhaustion, and infection of her wounds, she collapses, on the verge of death. The narrative switches to a group of people who call themselves ""The Clan"" and whom we come to understand are Neanderthal, whose cave was destroyed in the earthquake and who are searching for a new home. The medicine woman of the group, Iza, discovers the girl and asks permission from Brun, the head of the Clan, to help the ailing child, despite the child being clearly a member of ""the Others,"" the distrusted antagonists of the Clan. The child is adopted by Iza and her brother Creb. Creb is this group's ""Mog-ur"" or shaman, despite being deformed as a result of the difficult birth resulting from his abnormally large head and the later loss of an arm and eye after being attacked by a cave bear. The Clan worship spiritual representations of Earthly animals called ""totems"", whom they believe can influence their lives by way of good or bad luck and for whom Mog-ur acts as an intermediary. Brun agrees to allow Iza to treat the dying child and to adopt her only if Creb can discover her personal totem spirit. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نوزدهم ماه فوریه سال 2003 میلادیعنوان: قبیله خرس غار؛ نویسنده: جین ام. آول؛ مترجم: شهیندخت لطف اللهی (محبوب)؛ تهران، چشمه، 1381؛ در 585 ص؛ چاپ سوم 1389؛ شابک: 9789643620417؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 20 مداستان در پایان دوران انسانهای بدوی، یا همان نئاندرتالها، و آغاز دوران انسانهای اندیشه ورز روایت میشود، و ماجرایی پر کشش دارد. شخصیت اصلی داستان دختری به نام «آیلا» ست. آیلای پنج ساله، پس از زلزله ای بی‌خانمان میشود، و گروهی از نئاندرتال‌ها تصمیم‌ می‌گیرند از او نگهداری کنند. خوانشگر در این داستان شاهد رویارویی انسانهای اندیشه ورز با نسل انسانهای غارنشین در دوره‌ ی انقراض آن‌هاست. ا. شربیانی"

1296,4899552,it was amazing,"This book and the series that follows is endearing, troublesome, and whole-heartedly compassionate. This is the book my grandmother read to me as a little girl during the middle of a tornado, while we waited out the storm by candlelight. This is the book that started me reading... really reading. I learned that I can love my quiet time, and apparently I love stories on the ancient human race... our beginnings. The ways of survival, ways of development, natural medicine, culture and anthropology. The flavor of this book is 'tribal', but the sentiment and the moral is, ""the totem that chooses you can present many hardships and challenges, but the gifts are worth it."""
1296,1155165885,really liked it,"Suddenly, with a magician's flourish, he produced a skull. He held it high over his head with his strong left arm and turned slowly around in a complete circle so each man could see the large, distinctive, high-domed shape. The men stared at the cave bear's skull glowing whitely in the flickering light of the torches.Contemporary anthropology can be pretty confusing, and science may have disproved some of what’s on display here, but this novel does feel like it was well researched at any rate, so let’s leave it at that. It’s still just a story, and an historical-fantasy at that.“The child has a totem, a strong totem. We just don't know what it is.”And we all know the story by now. Cro-Magnon girl is orphaned by earthquake and is adopted by Neanderthal clan: drama and intrigue follows. It’s no surprise that emphasis is laid on the differences, and perceived differences, between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens.(I found the “Caveman” names quite typical, and amusing: Eg. Grod, Droog, Groob, Crug and for obvious reasons, Durc.)This book was pretty huge back in its day. It also seems to be provoking all kinds of debate. The reviews on goodreads alone make for interesting reading, and more than a little contradiction.Is the book racist? Is the book sexist? Is the book factually correct?More to the point: is the book any good?He had a sudden understanding of the gulf between the mind of this girl and his own, and it shook him.The intimacies of clan interaction does have a terrifically epic backdrop in prehistoric (paleolithic) Europe and something that the author conveys quite well is the solitude; you really do get the idea that there are not many people around. However, expect a bit of an infodump: there are pages and pages of depictions of plants and their medicinal properties. If you can skip-read over these, you’ll read the book in half the time I did (I compulsively read everything).She was part of nature's new experiment, and though she tried to model herself after the women of the clan, it was only an overlay, a facade only culture-deep, assumed for the sake of survival.It’s an interesting story, but also somewhat cyclical, with some events seemingly repeated in some form or other throughout the story. Season follows season; day to day depictions of paleolithic Neanderthal life serving as backdrop for the pissing contest between Ayla and Broud; wash, rinse, repeat. Something that reviewers seem to be skirting around is the rape scene depicted in the story. I found it fairly brutal, given the context (the victim is a 10-year girl), even if it does serve to move the story along. I would have expected the author to exhibit a modicum of sensitivity in the prose, but alas. The reason I’m mentioning this incident specifically is because it did influence my reading experience. Perhaps this is the idea, to set a more sinister tone for the rest of the novel.We don't know why your totem has led you to follow that ancient path, but we cannot deny the Spirit of the Cave Lion; it must be allowed.In the end, it’s testament to the staying power of the novel that I still enjoyed it despite its shortcomings. With a tweak here and an edit there it could have been great; as it is it’s still very good.3.5 StarsRead as part of the must-read agreement with my wife – 2015 "
1296,175180871,it was ok,"I loved this book when I was a teen. Indirectly, it lead to my pursuit of a BA in Anthropology. Perhaps it is that Anthropology degree that has rendered the book unreadable for me 25 years later."
1296,132341439,it was ok,"A disappointment. The concept is interesting, especially in light of recent archaeological evidence suggesting that Neandertals and Cro-Magnons (anatomically modern humans) may have interbred. However, the execution is extremely poor. The pacing is uneven, the prose is so flowery it hurts, and the characters are flat. Some other things that bothered me: --The author has the tendency to ""info-dump"", frequently disrupting the flow of the story to deliver lengthy descriptions of plants, rocks, characters' appearances, etc. I understand that setting is important here, as most readers aren't likely to be familiar with the flora and fauna of Ice Age Europe. In that regard, it's obvious that she did her research, but I felt the depiction could have been done better; maybe if the prose weren't so purple, or if she didn't describe the same caves, valleys, and plants over and over again, I wouldn't have minded so much.  --The repetition. Oh lord, the repetition. Constant reiterations of how different Ayla is, how special, how strange, how unique, blah blah blah. Yes, she is different from the people of the Clan (I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say her belonging to a different species might have something to do with that), WE GET IT, MOVE ON. --Faulty science. Somewhere near the beginning of the book, Auel makes some kind of reference to the size of the Clan members' (Neandertals) heads being related to how much knowledge they can hold. At first, this seems to make some sort of sense, as the size of the skull influences brain size (although brain size and intelligence are not directly correlated--Neandertals' brains were actually larger than ours, though we have no way of knowing how smart they were). But later on she states that this is the reason they cannot progress technologically--because their brains, and therefore their skulls, would have to get larger in order to learn new things, and if their heads get too large, childbirth will become impossible. Honey, that is just not how it works. Does your brain get bigger every time you learn something new? No? Didn't think so. There are also numerous references to ""the memories""--knowledge of ceremonies, traditions, skills and Clan history that Clan members are apparently born with. They also have some kind of mystical abilities to access and share the memories of their ancestors stored in their own minds. Though it makes for an intriguing storytelling element, this notion is historically and scientifically ridiculous. It isn't possible for someone to be born with memories or cultural knowledge--culture is learned, and memories are gathered through personal experience. If this were a fantasy book, the mystical story elements would make more sense. But Clan of the Cave Bear isn't a fantasy (supposedly). I found it in the historical fiction section of the library, and I've seen it listed as historical fiction everywhere else I've looked. Just as ludicrous were Auel's assertions that the Clan people are capable of speech but not laughter (fossil evidence suggests that Neandertals did had the capacity for vocal communication, and if they can speak, there's no reason why they should be unable to laugh), and incapable of crying. These were merely plot devices to make Ayla stand out, but the absolute lack of logic in these distinctions makes me wonder if Auel put any thought at all into why they should exist.  --All of the Neandertal characters have dark hair, skin and eyes, whereas Ayla is blonde, blue-eyed and fair-skinned. I suppose I should give Auel a break on this one, since the book was written in the 1980s, while technology that made it possible to sequence Neandertal DNA--which led to the discovery that some of them possessed the genes coding for fair skin and red or blond hair--wasn't available until a few years ago. Still, I sensed a white supremacist agenda. Ayla, the ""golden-haired goddess"" is so much better at everything than the people of the Clan, she seems to bring them luck, everything is better with her around, and anyone who treats her badly receives divine retribution."
1296,1984871095,it was amazing,"You know what...this has been on my 'to-read' list for years... years and years and years, and yet I only just got to it...WELLIt was worth the wait!This is the story of a young child called Ayla who is born over 35,000 years ago during Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon times. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon who is adopted by a group of Neanderthal people when they find her stranded and abandoned after heavy snowfall and a great Earthquake. Ayla has managed to get to a Cave where she was chased by (but evaded) a Cave Lion. Many of the Neanderthals in this story believe in the Gods and signs/omens from their Totems, one of these being the great Cave Lion who is mighty beyond nearly all others. As this young girl has been marked by a Cave Lion and survived, they deem it acceptable (even positive) to take her along with them. Ayla is taken with the Clan (as they call themselves) to a new cave far from the place where the Quake happened and she lost her own people. At first, the others in the Clan are afraid of her blue eyes and the water she produces when she's sad, but as the time and later the years go by she becomes integrated into their small community. This is the story of her culture clashing and melding with theirs. It's what happens when two entirely different races and culture meet in the form of one young girl, and it's the story of how Ayla defied everything they could ever have anticipated for her.What I truly loved about this story was the poise and clarity that Auel gives these characters. There's evidently a lot of reserach that went into these characters and they do feel like highly plausible beings who may once have walked our very same Earth. At many points in the story Auel points out various problems with anatomy, struggles with ideas, and challenges of build that both the Clan and Ayla have respectively. It made me really start to think how things that seem so basic and simple and easy to us today are the products of years and ages of evolution and development from beings much like these.Auel's writing reminds me of Lois McMaster Bujold's fantasy, J.V. Jones (though maybe this is more interms of setting than prose) and even Robin Hobb to some extent. I think all of these authors share something about the quality and unique authenticity of their writings, and it just registers with me really well.I loved the character of Ayla right from the start, probably becuase she is much more like me and has many of the traits that will no doubt develop into humanity as we know it today. Ayla is resourceful and filled with a desire to develop and learn and be excited by the world, something the Clan find hard to comprehend let alone to emanate. Of course the magic described by Auel is certainly imagined more than researched, but there may well be grains of the truth scattered in. The idea of gods and Totem animals as guiding factors for life certainly seem plausible as belief systems for societies like this one, and even the rituals and strange occurrences could relate to magic.I really enjoyed the creativity and ingenuity Auel bought to the Clan and their magic, and I feel like it worked really well as a vital part of the story and culture for this world.Honestly, I could go on for quite some time with all the things I completely loved about this book but I think I'll finish by saying it's great and you should read it for yourself. I am so glad that there are quite a few more in the series as I have a feeling I am going to love the rest too, and I can't wait to read them. 5*s"
1296,3432940,it was amazing,"This was a fantastic book. I read it in 7th grade, and was absolutely obsessed with it (which is nothing less than stunning, because at that age most books that lacked dragons weren't worth my time...). In a way its perfect for around that age, because its all about struggling for acceptance and trying to learn the social norms of a society. But really, everybody has dealt with those issues, and will be able to empathize with the characters. And the setting is so unique, the writing so vibrant, that I imagine most people will find themselves engaged. The rest of the series isn't nearly as good. Valley of the Horses is fun but lacking the depth. I stopped reading them after the third book in the series."

Jondalar, be still my beating heart!), sometimes the story is just that good romance doesn't need to feature, this is one of those. I adored this book, and still do after re-reads. A truly amazing, captivating and fascinating series that will stay at the very top of my all time favourites list.Not even 10 stars is enough for this book."
1296,238714294,it was amazing,"""[Ayla] was a woman, and she had more courage than you...more determination, more self-control""Ayla is a five year old child when an earthquake forces her to flee her destroyed home and her dead parents. Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear, stumbles upon her and takes her under her wing, but Broud, the proud son of the clan leader, Brun, takes an immediate disliking to the young non-Clan girl. Ayla grows up among the clan and struggles to find her place.I've heard so much about this series of books, particularly with the most recent (and apparently last of the series??) release of The Land of Painted Caves. While I had read that that book wasn't so hot, I did read reviews that praised the first few books. So I went out and got my hands on an audiobook of the first in the Earth's Children series.First off, I have to give kudos to Auel for all the research and time she put into this novel. This woman didn't go, ""I'm going to write a pre-historic novel"" and then just throw in some almost modern humans in a wallpaper world. This book transports you back before cars and computers, before women's rights and civil rights, into a fantasy realm of what the world might have been like before the modern age. It was vibrant and meticulously detailed. I loved how the Others could speak but the Clan could not; how the Clan could access memories but were bad at new innovations while the opposite was true of the Others. A lesser author, like I said, would have seen the work needed and given up; Auel pushed on and produced a damn fine novel.Besides the vibrant setting, the characters were detailed and intricate. My favorites were Iza and Creb, but I also liked Ayla herself, Brun, and Ooba (sp?). I liked how Iza embraced Ayla and was thoughtful enough to pass along the medicine woman trade, trying to think of Ayla's future. Iza was a warm, loving, kind-hearted, strong woman. Creb was fantastic. I thought he was sweet and kind, a good father-figure for Ayla, and I loved the comparisons between him and Ayla and between him and Ayla's son, Dirk. Ayla was a great character; she grows so much throughout the book. She tries to find her place in the clan; she is constantly testing the boundaries, but not because she is always defiant. Ayla is just not Clan; she is of the Others, and that breeding comes through. I liked the differences that she accented between Clan and Others: speech, crying, differences in body shape (I really liked how the Clan had a different perception of beauty). There were a few times when she (or her son) got really close to that Mary Sue line--the amount of times she breaks rules and is able to keep from being killed is pretty astonishing. However, I think Ayla did have enough faults, and was legitimately punished enough that I didn't focus on it too much. (I wonder, though, how far it is into the series before her turn to Mary Sue-ism comes is complete.) Brun was a great strong leader; he listened to his people, but wasn't afraid of action, afraid of punishment. And Ooba became such a sweet, loving sister to Ayla. I couldn't help but think of me and my sister when I read about the two.The story meanders along Ayla's life, her struggles to become Clan, and her tension with Broud. I loved how she learned to hunt with a sling, and I liked how she became a good medicine woman, how she would drop everything to try to save someone's life. I got to learn so much in this book, my mind was bent to new depths--what would life be like living in a cave? What was the world like before?If anything about the story bugged me, it would be the sudden departures into talking about mixing medicines. As I said above, I loved the research Auel put into this book; that said, inserting several passages ONLY to show what plants mixed with what roots would make a cure for this ailment got old. Fast. Fortunately, there were not TOO many of these scenes, but there were enough to be noteworthy.Also, there is quite a bit of violence/abuse in this novel. Women are basically treated like property. Men can beat women and be completely justified--this happens to Ayla quite a few times in the book. Men also can force a woman to have sex whenever the desire hits them--even if the woman is not their wife. Again, this happens to Ayla quite a bit, in a rather uncomfortable rape montage (nothing is too graphic, however). While I am sure this is more realistic than having Clan women burning their bras (or whatever they would have used for bras), it is not for everyone and was rather uncomfortable at times to listen to. Sometimes, I wanted to smack some sense into these Clan men--how dare you treat someone like that! Being female does NOT mean being stupid and being unable to think for yourself! Ultimately, I appreciated how Auel did NOT resort to writing the Clan as if they were wise, with modern sensibilities about feminism...but I still hated the abuse.I honestly cannot wait to start reading the next book. I am desperate to know what happens to Ayla...does she meet up with her people? Does she find a mate? I've read enough reviews to know some of the answers to my questions, but that doesn't make me any less eager to read for myself. I greatly enjoyed reading this prehistoric journey, and I definitely recommend--with the caveat that there is some abuse/violence to be on the lookout for."
1296,1127792277,it was amazing,"This book was powerful for me. It brought to life a world disappeared by more than 10,000 years. Ayla is such an inspiration and strong woman. I love her dedication to life and to her tribe and to herself. I love that she became a medicine woman. This book is one of a kind. "
1296,1311900540,it was amazing,"It was long and maybe just a little too descriptive at times... but incredibly creative. I couldn't put it down. Also, I listened to the audiobook. Narrator was okay, but read a bit fast and with without enough inflection at times... this got better as the story progressed. All in all a fabulous read. Looking forward to book two."
1296,860796234,liked it,"I came to The Clan of the Cave Bear at the Mission Viejo Library when the novel I'd wanted next -- The Witching Hour by Anne Rice -- was out. Wandering the hardcover fiction, a row of books at eye level with thick, colorful spines and the same author snared my attention. Published in 1980, this bestseller launched five sequels, a maligned film adaptation in 1986 and became an industry onto Jean M. Auel, whose published fiction has been dedicated solely to this Ice Age series.Set in the late Pleistocene Epoch as many as 35,000 years ago and in an area that looks suspiciously like the present day Crimean Peninsula, of all places, The Clan of the Cave Bear begins with a 5-year-old girl named Ayla whose tribe is wiped out in an earthquake while she's off swimming in a stream. After nearly becoming a meal of the cave lions, Ayla is found starving and badly wounded by a tribe of wanderers who've also been displaced by the quake. Brown haired, stocky and bow legged, the leader of the wanderers, Brun, recognizes Ayla as one of ""The Others"", a tribe that's blonde haired, lean and tall. Communicating with sign language and grunts as much as words, Brun ignores Ayla (""Not clan"") but his medicine woman, a 30 year old senior citizen named Iza, takes pity on the girl and brings her back from the dead. The wanderers are desperately in search of shelter and it's Ayla who directs Iza's attention to a perfect cave.One of the chief reasons to read the novel is Auel's credible portrayal of Ayla as the ultimate outsider, the First Outsider, who grows to maturity with the sense that she's different from everyone else and struggles to find her purpose. Ayla looks other clan members in the eye, a major faux pas for a woman. Her physique permits her the ability to swim, which she uses to save the life of a clan member from drowning. Ayla's curiosity also leads her to teach herself how to use a sling and hunt with it, a crime punishable by death when the offender is a woman. Auel mines a great deal of tension by pitting Ayla against Broud, the ill-tempered son of Brun and heir apparent to the clan's leadership who is deeply offended by Ayla's ways and engages her in a battle of wills. I kept reading because I wanted to see the moment Ayla stood up for herself and went all Tina Turner to Ike, in this case, Broud.Auel's research (begun in 1977 in consultation with numerous experts) offers interesting glimpses into prehistoric survival, the work of female gatherers preparing foods and medicines, and the work of male hunters tracking and killing game, most memorably, a trek north to hunt mammoth. My attention waned when it came to descriptions of religious rites where there seemed to be far less at stake (no chance of anyone getting injured or killed). While the characters have forgotten more about the natural world than you or I will ever know, their weakness is a shortened life span; Ayla reaches womanhood and achieves status as Woman Who Hunts by age 10. I found the biology of the characters to be unique, a facet lost in the film version with Daryl Hannah, 25 years old and 5'10"", cast in the role of Ayla.The major weakness of The Clan of the Cave Bear is Auel's geriatric writing, which is plodding, and tells and tells and tells. I consider myself intelligent enough to imagine what characters are thinking or feeling by how they act and what they say to each other. I scanned the last 100 pages. There was simply not enough at stake -- at no point does the reader consider Auel's heroine might be killed -- and the author's visible attempt at writing kept me from becoming absorbed in the world she was creating.Fortunately, writing takes a back seat for me. I can excuse a lot of telling versus showing if the author creates a compelling character, builds a fantastic world and dares me to put down the book without knowing what's going to happen to the character. I'm recommending this to readers with an interest in the prehistoric world or an interest in how to build a series. I can't say Auel hooked me into reading the sequels, but for a debut novel, this is a good one."
1296,689562505,really liked it,"What a great re-read. I definitely got A WHOLE LOT more out of this than I did when I was about 9 years old. I will be keeping my rating at a high 4!The amount of research it must have taken to complete this book is impressive. Although at times long-winded, Auel's descriptions of the prehistoric setting really transports the reader right back into that time period. And what we don't know from history, she manages to expertly fill in the gaps with her imagination, creating a fascinating mythology and believable cast of characters.The main character, Ayla, is incredibly resilient and interesting to follow. I cared deeply about what happened to her and was constantly enthralled to learn what her future would hold. I look forward to continuing on with the series and finally finishing what I started almost 20 years ago. "
1296,2177719061,liked it,"2.5 ⭐⭐This book is not for everyone. It certainly wasn't for me.It is astonishingly brutal in the description of both human endurance and cruelty. The story is compelling and once you started it, you'll want to follow it to the end just so you can see what happens to the little orphan girl. But you may feel the need at times to alternately roll your eyes, hurl the book across the room, or punch something. If there is one thing this book does well, it is to bring out negative emotions in the readers. It is a heart-wrenching story of survival of the fittest in one of the most cruel societies I have encountered until now."
1296,2351419809,really liked it,"Kalbant apie šią knygą reikėtų pradėti visų pirma nuo to, kad pati pasakojimo idėja yra tikrai labai nebloga: Cro-Magnon (arba kitaip ankstyvasis anatomiškai šiuolaikinis žmogus) susidūrimas su neandertaliečiais, o jei tiksliau, vienos iš kro-magnonų mergaitės istorija, atsidūrus neandertaliečių gentyje. Aš šiaip nesu didelis istorijos mėgėjas, bet bent jau iš laifstailo ir kultūros prizmių žiūrint man įdomūs beveik visi istoriniai periodai, neišskiriant ir ankstyvojo akmens amžiaus, kurio metu ir vystosi siužetas. O neandertalietis VS žmogus siužetinė linija yra labai, labai palanki, norint rašyti romaną. Šiuo metu yra net penkios teorijos, kodėl neandertaliečiai išnyko: a) asimiliavosi su žmonėmis (nes, pasirodo, maišymasis tarp rūsių buvo įmanomas ir didžioji dauguma iš mūsų savo genome nešiojamės apytikriai nuo 1,8 iki 2,6 % iš neandertaliečių kilusių genų);b) mes juos sunaikinome fiziškai;c) ilgą laiką sugyvenome greta ir taikiai, o jie paprasčiausiai išmirė dėl demografinių problemų (konkurencija su protingesniais mumis irgi, aišku, nepadėjo, bet shit happens, čia ne mūsų kaltė);d) dėl kitoniško imuniteto neatlaikė mūsų atneštų bakterijų ir parazitų;e) klimato pokyčiai, dėl kurių neandertaliečiai nesugebėjo prisitiakyti prie laikmečio ir pasikeitusių taisyklių;įdomiausia dalis yra ta, kad faktiškai nėra jokios informacijos, kuri daugiau ar įtikinamiau paremtų kurią nors iš teorijų, tad galima teigti, jog visos jos vienodai tikėtinos, kas rašytojams palieka labai, labai plačią veiksmų ir teorijų laisvę. Pati Jean Auel pasiruošė šios knygos rašymui labiau, nei vadinami ""method actors"" ruošiasi vaidmeniui - ji mėnesių mėnesiais nenulipdavo nuo sprando paleologams, įstojusi į survaivalistų būrelį išmoko, kaip įsirengti olą, išdirbti odas, įkurti ugnį, tašyti akmenį, praleido daug laiko mokydamasi ir tyrinėdama vaistažoles. Visa tai yra labai įspūdinga, bet tai turi ir savo kainą: knyga kartais labiau primena ne romaną, o rankdarbių vadovėlį, o didžiausias minusas yra tas, kad visi šiti pasakojimai apie kasdienius darbus ir vaistažolių rinkimą ir įrankių gamybą tiesiog niekada nesibaigia. Tai nėra blogai, tiesą sakant, nemažą dalį informacijos skaičiau visai susidomėjęs, o ir vertėjos darbą reiktų atskirai paminėti. Man didžiausią problemą anglų kalboje kelia tikriniai daiktavardžiai, ypač paukščių ir augalų pavadinimai. Čia gi pavadinimų buvo tiek, ir dar negana to, tokių, kad aš jų ir lietuviškai nelabai esu girdėjęs, o čia juos dar reikėjo ir išverst iš kitos kalbos. Bet kuriuo atveju, tai yra ganėtinai neblogas coming-of-age romanas, tiesa, labai jau neįprastomis aplinkybėmis. Bet jis man visai patiko jau vien dėl savo originalumo ir netradicinio siužeto. Žinoma, yra nemaža dalis ""ar tikrai"" faktoriaus, bet čia jau nieko nepadarysi - jei jau kalbam apie tai, kas buvo prieš 40000 metų, yra tam tikri momentai, kurie galų gale sueis į take it or leave it. Tai aš prie tų, kurie took it. 4*, nors ir kiek su avansu - bet trys, manau, būtų per mažai, nes tikrai su dideliu susidomėjimu ir malonumu prarijau šią knygą."

Nos regala una mirada, aunque ficticia, bastante desarrollada y justificada, de los que pudo ser la vida de nuestros primeros antepasados más directos, siempre a través de una perspectiva familiar y cercana.Ayla, la protagonista, nos ofrece una visión genial de las limitaciones del cerebro de los Neandertales con respecto al suyo propio, más avanzado. Esta perspectiva nos brinda escenas curiosas como esa en que el mago de la tribu le explica el concepto de número -uno, dos y más de dos-, y ella inmediatamente entiende que está hablando de una serie continua que se prolonga mucho más allá y con la que se pueden hacer operaciones sencillas. Estas reflexiones, pronunciadas de manera tan ágil, dejan al anciano totalmente desconcertado e incluso temeroso.Reseña completa y diseño de portada en http://sidumbledorefueralibrero.com/2..."

Meanwhile, I had discovered Victoria Holt and Mary Stewart and Ken Follett and I had plenty to read."
1296,147950977,really liked it,"Frankly, Auel gets points simply for tackling this period, as I have not found any other books set around this era. Very little is known about human culture in this period apart from a basic overview, let alone Neanderthal culture. Particularly aspirations, values, and spiritual belief systems are the hardest to deduce from the material archaeological record. Auel avoids the problem of getting into the complex details of culture by making the novel more about character relationships than an exotic cultural setting. It is also clear that Auel is no writer of thrilling action sequences, and the book could have done with some of those to break up the heavy relationship dramas. Still, perhaps if writing action is not her forte, Auel's decision to avoid it could have been a wise one.The character dramas are very well done, and the lack of action does allow more time to appreciate the wondrous natural environment in which Ayla moves, although I still maintain that the best novels contain a little of everything. In any case, the hunter-gatherer environment was indeed richly created, and I loved the descriptions, especially Ayla's secret clearing.However, Auel couldn't avoid creating a culture entirely. Whilst she does not have to create a culture for the Cro-Magnons in this first book, she does loosely construct a culture for Neanderthals. The method of communication through gestures seems a perfectly plausible supposition, and the lack of sophistication of the Clan's thought processes draws upon a logical conclusion, but no evidence exists for the idea that females assumed and inferior and strict submissive place in Neanderthal hierarchy, and it is a notion I would personally challenge, as I find it easy to imagine the hardy, thickset Neanderthal women assuming strong and equal places in their society. However, if an author is going to delve into the realms of pure fiction, I do appreciate, as Auel has done, the creation of something for which there is no specific evidence against, and may well have been an actual possibility, rather than authors deliberately and brutally twisting known facts. The idea of animal totems in clan belief was a very interesting and striking one, although it serves largely as a plot device. Creb's rituals occasionally veer over the line of reality towards the fantastical, but Auel just about gets away with it without introducing magic into proceedings and thus transforming the novel from an historical based fiction into a ludicrous fantasy.Ayla is the Cro-Magnon girl whose eyes we see most of the story through, and she stands in stark contrast to all the Neanderthal around her. She is inventive, adaptive, and makes lightning quick connections in her mind. She flaunts the rules about submission in women to try and experience new things, a compulsion that never once occurs to the Neanderthal women. However, she is not perfect, and in addition she is so unfairly persecuted by Broud that she does earn your sympathy.I would not call ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" amazing writing, but it's pretty decent, and an enjoyable story that's packed with detailed, fleshed out character relationships and it kept me turning the pages to the very end. By no means is the ending a happy one, but I would recommend this book. "
1296,23966201,it was amazing,"So, I read this book in high school, and it was SO GOOD. It's about this little girl (Ayla) who is left orphaned and alone during prehistoric times, then picked up and raised by Neanderthals. They think she's ugly and weird, but in reality she is a stunningly beautiful, tall blonde leggy woman. She just is living with a bunch of under-evolved people who don't see it. (I think I loved this book because I imagined it was the same way in my life. I am way hotter than people give me credit for, probably.)So anyways, she grows up, leaves them, meets up with her own people, and falls in love with a hot tall blonde guy named Jondalar. They have adventures. There is a lot more to it in there, and I found the book fascinating. I would really like to read all the rest of the books in the series. I have no idea why I never found time over the years. I have read at least part of the second in the series, maybe all of it. Oh, if only the internet had existed in high school and I'd had this website, I would remember!K, here is an embarassing story about this book: I went to Enrichment (a church women's meeting) about 3-4 years ago, and they were having a book sharing activity. Everyone brought good books, and we shared ideas about what to read. It was my turn to share a book I really liked, and I named this one. Another (totally nice) girl at the table then said, ""That book actually has a lot of really passionate parts in it, I believe."" (Read: that book has some really torrid love scenes.) I said, ""Oh, really? Ummmm. well...I read it a long time ago, I guess I forgot about those."" (Interpretation: ""Crap, I shouldn't have mentioned a book with R rated parts at a church activity."") The girl said, ""Well, you were a teenager when you read it. You probably didn't understand what they were talking about."" Me: ""Yep."" (Actually, it would be darn near impossible not to have known what they were talking about.)So anyways, I was totally embarassed. Then about a year ago it occurred to me: WAIT A MINUTE. If she knows there were ""passionate parts"" in it, then SHE READ THE BOOK TOO. And obviously she didn't stop at the first sign of a ""passionate part"", or she wouldn't have know that there were passionate parts (plural). Right? RIGHT! So basically, she indicted herself right along with me. If she was smart, she would've just pretended never to have heard of the book.As a(nother) side note, I believe I mentioned on here in a recent book review that I have never belonged to a real life book club, I just talk about books on here. Well, that's because the girl I mentioned in the paragraphs preceding has been in charge of the book club in my ward for years. I am afraid she'll ask for book suggestions and I will suggest one with swear words in it or something. "
1296,345070555,it was amazing,"I reread this recently and decided to upgrade it to 5 stars. The amount of research in this book is phenomenal and the plot better than I remembered.

1296,786701821,it was amazing," My #7 Favorite read of 2013   A Unique and Entrancing 5 Stars  When I am rating a book, I am internally comparing that book to other similar books in the genre and asking myself if it is on par with the best I have read. For me, when it comes to rating what I deem to be Historical Fiction, 5 stars are a rarity. It is my favorite genre and there is always a masterpiece to which it can be compared. That said,  The Clan of the Cave Bear  has no peers. For me, this story explores a time that I have never explored or read and I have basis for comparison. In general, as historical fiction, it meets all my requirements. There is a sense of realism, the sense the author has researched the time period, a sense that the characters belong in the time period and ability of the author to help of live history instead of reciting it.As far as historical fiction in concerned,  The Clan of the Cave Bear  is likely far more Fiction than historical. The setting is prehistoric times and what we know or claim to know of these early days is no more than our best guesses. Regardless, Jean Auel clearly researched the available material and provide and interesting look into prehistoric life. Plot summary After an earthquake kills the family of Ayla, a ""Cro-Magnon"" girl, she is adopted into the clan of Neanderthals. The child is different from her adoptive clan. She does not have the shared memories and the instinctual ways of the life as the Neanderthals. She is an inquisitive, logical tall and blond while her new family is survival oriented, ingrained, short and squat. She struggles to be considered part of a clan in which she should not be accepted. The story watches this outsider come of age and explores how her logical and creative mind allows her to integrate herself with a different people The Good The book contains a minimal amount of dialogue. The Clan vocalized little more than names and communication is a series of the complicated hand signals. While this may seems like a recipe for disaster, the author integrates it seamlessly. The minimal dialogue feels natural and comfortable. The story does an amazing job of integrating theories of early man. The ideas of the shared and instinctual memory was fascinating as it gave the Neanderthals both a human and animalistic feel. While both race of people considered themselves human it was interesting to see people separated by something other than race, color or language but separated by fundamental difference in biological construction. The Bad I have very little to say that is negative. From time to time the conversation felt too modern. Given that the author was using words to express non verbal communication, I can't hold it against her. Generally, I am not at a loss when it comes to finding fault. The majority of the issues that I may have had with the book were petty and not worth mentioning.  Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  2.5 There is discussion of the sexual intercourse. Family lived in caves without wall or rooms and sex was not hidden and was a daily and open reality. This is discussed on several occasions. Over the course of one chapter there is discussion of a series of rapes. The descriptions are not graphic but some readers will be disturbed by the portrayal. Language  -  1 There was not use of adult language.  Violence  -  3 There is violence as noted under ""sex"". Some readers may find the depictions of woman to be disturbing and several character engaging in physical assaults on women. There is one serious assault and several instance of single punches or hits. Again, the depictions are not graphic. There is some minor gore in hunting scene and one results in the death or a clan member. There is an instance of cannibalism that some readers will find disturbing."

She could accept the new, shape it to her will, forge it into ideas undreamed of by the Clan, and, in nature's way, her kind was destined to supplant the ancient, dying race.This book has been on my TBR list for years, and I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it. I so enjoyed learning more about this period in time (somewhere between 28,000 to 25,000 years before present). I thought the author did a brilliant job showing us about their day to day lives. I was especially impressed with all the information on herbs and how Iza, the medicine woman, used them. When historical fiction starts going this far back in time I realize that there must be quite a bit of fiction/fantasy involved, but according to most sources the author's work is quite accurate and authentic, especially with regards to anthropology. It has, however, been found that Neanderthals had a hyoid bone and may thus have been capable of using vocal language and not as dependent on sign language as portrayed in the series. I never realized that the Cro-Magnons and the Neanderthals co-existed at some point in time, and found this part of the story very intriguing. I recommend this book to all lovers of historical fantasy.The Story: Leave the modern world and go back to Ice Age Europe. Follow Ayla, a Cro-Magnon child who loses her parents in an earthquake and is adopted by a tribe of Neanderthal, the Clan. See how the Clan's wary suspicion is gradually transformed into acceptance of this girl, so different from them, under the guidance of its medicine woman Iza and its wise holy man Creb. "
1296,172150378,it was ok,"Sometimes I wanted to throw this book out the window. Or at someone. It's a hefty little paperback, and my copy is old enough that it the pages no longer lie quite next to each other on the spine, so it looks even bigger than it is. I have no doubt that if it were to hit someone in the head, it could seriously annoy that person and even cause a headache. That's often the feeling I experienced while reading The Clan of the Cave Bear. But I wouldn't turn this book into a projectile out of mere spite or desire to cause headaches. No, the temptation was purely an urge to remove the book from my vicinity as quickly as possible.I apologize for the somewhat lengthy and uncharacteristic paragraph of plot summary that follows. I promise it has a point.In a world of long, harsh winters and short summers, the Clan of the Cave Bear is a humanoid civilization that worships Ursus for bringing them culture and traditions. There are many clans within the Clan, each of which live in their own caves, have their own leaders and medicine women and mog-urs (shamans). One such clan, led by the fair-minded Brun, is searching for a new cave after theirs was destroyed in an earthquake. They stumble across an injured five-year-old child—but she is not Clan. She is a member of the Others, a strange species that looks humanoid but is not Clan. Brun reluctantly allows his medicine woman to care for the child, whose name is Ayla. For the most part this brings his clan great luck, but Ayla has a lot of trouble fitting in. She fails to conform to the Clan standards for women, preferring instead to hunt and assert herself in ways permitted only to men. And she earns the ire of the future leader of the clan, the impetuous Broud. Through the eyes of Ayla and members of Brun's clan, Jean Auel tells a story about family, acceptance, loyalty, honour, tradition, and yes, race.There is just one problem.This book is actually set 30,000 years ago in prehistoric Europe. The Clan are the Neanderthals, while the Others are Cro-Magnons, anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens. While this might not sound problematic—and I admit that I'm probably weird seeing it as a problem—it is the one element of this book that I cannot overlook.I know this book is insanely popular (especially given its subject matter). I might even have read it at some point in the distant past (14? 16? I don't recall). To be honest, I probably wouldn't have ever picked up this book again were it not for the fact that I inherited it from a friend who moved away. I like historical fiction, but prehistorical fiction is another matter.Historical fiction is based, in addition to archaeological evidence, primary source material like written records, artwork, and if it's more recent, photography and audio or video recordings. The farther back in time one goes, the sparser the record and the more difficult it is to portray a society ""realistically"". Often this isn't a problem; it's fiction, after all, and we expect some licence.Prehistory is different. By definition there are not written records; there are pressure few remnants of artwork, and much to our chagrin, the Neanderthals recorded everything on Betamax or, much later, in whatever format the Zune uses. (And who has one of those these days?) So their voices are probably lost to us forever. We can speculate, but it is very difficult to determine what Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon culture was like from the archaeological record. This gives archaeologists and anthropologists plenty to do when they are not actually in ur fields, diggin' up ur ancestors. It lets them form (perhaps untestable) hypotheses about homonin societies based on what evidence we do have. That's really cool, and I love reading non-fiction books about such theories. The dearth of solid information, however, makes the job of a writer of prehistorical fiction that much more difficult. I'm not going to rule out all prehistorical fiction from this one experience, but Auel has not convinced me The Clan of the Cave Bear is a shining example of the genre.I actually reached a point where I had to break out the sticky notes and mark a few pages for later reference. This happens on occasion with a book, usually if it's really bad or really good. In this case, the quotations highlight my issue with the way Auel portrays the evolutionary competition between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. In The Clan of the Cave Bear, Neanderthals possess a genetic memory that is nearing its maximum storage capacity:But as more memories built up, crowding and enlarging the storage capacity of their brain, changes came harder. There was no more room for new ideas that would be added to their memory bank, their heads were already too large. Women had difficulty giving birth; they couldn't afford new knowledge that would enlarge their heads even more.Suffice it to say, there is no record of Neanderthals, or any hominins, possessing a genetic memory. It's true that The Clan of the Cave Bear is steeped in scientific accuracy; Auel did her research. This is not one of those accuracies. This appears to be something of her own invention (or an idea she borrowed from another theorist), and quite frankly, it breaks the book for me. Despite trite allusions to evolution and nature, Auel's proposed reason for the demise of the Neanderthals runs contrary to very idea of Darwinian evolution:Her brain followed different paths, her full, high forehead that housed forward-thinking frontal lobes gave her an understanding from a different view. She could accept the new, shape it to her will, forge it into ideas undreamed of by the Clan, and, in nature's way, her kind was destined to supplant the ancient, dying race.At a deep, unconscious level, Broud sensed the opposing destinies of the two. Ayla was more than a threat to his masculinity, she was a threat to his existence. His hatred of her was the hatred of the old for the new, of the traditional for the innovative, of the dying for the living. Broud's race was too static, too unchanging. They had reached the peak of their development; there was no more room to grow. Ayla was part of nature's new experiment, and though she tried to model herself after the women of the clan, it was only an overlay, a façade only culture-deep, assumed for the sake of survival.Evolution does not work that way. Species do not reach ""peaks"" of development and find ""no more room to grow"". The extinction of the Neanderthals was not destiny.Let me be clear: I am not suggesting that Auel is saying that Cro-Magnons were ""destined"" to supplant Neanderthals or that the Neanderthals were necessarily doomed as a result of their genetic memory. She could be saying that. If so, I find it very problematic. I cannot countenance calling this book ""historical fiction"" and lauding its scientific accuracy if Auel rejects something so fundamental as the theory of evolution. It's also possible to interpret all of this as an attempt to be poetic—hence, the references to ""destiny"" and such are the twentieth-century narrator's hindsight being applied to the story at hand. This does not absolve Auel entirely, for it is still an example of sloppy writing, but at least it is, in my mind, a lesser crime. And this is consistent with the narration in The Clan of the Cave Bear in general, which is itself rather inconsistent. The book switches between following one particular character's thoughts from a limited third-person perspective to an omniscient twentieth-century perspective. This is accompanied by a corresponding change in vocabulary. Consequently, all complaints about the science aside, I had a hard time even reading this book. I felt almost like I was reading some kind of children's story. Here's an example:The women breathed easier. They knew Ayla was inexperienced, and though they had little choice but to allow the girl to treat Brac, they were concerned. A hunter needed two good strong arms. If Brac lost the use of one, he would never become a leader as he was destined. If he was unable to hunt, he would not even become a man, but would live out his life in the ambiguous limbo in which older boys, who had reached physical maturity but had not made their first kill, existed.I picked that by opening the book at random. The entire book is littered with phrases like, ""They knew"", ""Ayla knew"", ""Creb knew"", etc., which preface exposition by Auel that shows off her extensive research into various prehistorical methods of life. I love that she did all that research, and in some ways it does improve the book. Unfortunately, Auel often chooses to divulge her knowledge in the least engaging way possible.No, this book works much better when viewed as a fantasy or science-fiction novel about a world far, far away. As I set it up in my plot summary at the beginning of this review, one can easily ignore the references to our Earth of the past and treat the Clan and the Others as two alien species, one with genetic memory that is proving a liability. In this way, the problematic parts of the story's narration become more forgivable, and The Clan of the Cave Bear becomes a fascinating thought experiment. Now, I might be a literary snob, but I'm no literary tyrant, and you are free to regard this book as historical fiction if you like. I wish I could have enjoyed this book more, because it had a lot of potential, and there are some genuinely great things about it—alas, certain aspects of Auel's style and writing were enough to sour the experience for me.

1296,2439377793,it was amazing,"Yesterday was one of those moments where I finished a book and went ""...Damn, I wish I'd known while reading this that it would make it onto that really short list of books I wish I could read again for the first time."" I probably would have savoured it more. Buddy read with Caught Between Pages. Thanks for the lovely discussions about unlovely things :)And this book is full of unlovely things. Ayla is a cro-magnon child separated from her people. She is taken in by a clan of Neanderthals, less evolved than the cro-magnon, and raised to live by their methods. It's equally a story of love and abuse. Love from some of her newfound family, but abuse from a man who can't understand her desire for more than her assigned role as a female in the clan.For anyone else who doesn't know too much about Neanderthals vs Cro Magnons, like me, all you have to know is that the cro-magnon (like Ayla) were of the same species as us, and that the Neanderthals (who raised Ayla) were a separate species, though we do share some of their DNA from interbreeding. The cro-magnons eventually replaced the Neanderthals when the Neanderthals failed to keep evolving.
Clan of the Cave Bear had the power to make me absolutely livid, without making me angry at the author or the book itself. This book is ultimately one girl's fight to fit in and her journey towards a greater equality than what she's been told she has the right to. So of course it's full of all kinds of horrible treatment of women, and of course it's going to make a modern reader a bit frustrated, but (as in my case) completely fascinate them as well. It's so interesting to read about the clan's reasoning for dividing the gender roles so clearly. It makes sense in a way given that species' limited ability to learn and retain too many skills, but it's really satisfying to see such a great character challenge that.I think that dynamic is what made this book so riveting to me. Here you have this really advanced girl being raised by a species who are essentially backwards by comparison. Despite trying her best to conform to their ways, that extra little bit of forebrain power sparks a rebellious nature in her which pretty much leads to every critical point in the novel. And maybe it's just me, but that is so freaking cool. And kind of tragic.The writing:The writing is a bit simplistic and kind of gets in the way at times. I read the sentence ""She woke up screaming!"" three times in this book. Why is there an exclamation mark in prose outside of dialogue? There are also some painstakingly long sections about herbal plant applications, and many of the concepts and ideals of the clan are repeated ad nauseam. The characters:Ayla is such a well-developed protagonist. It's nice to be able to so firmly identify myself as being on a character's side from the first few chapters in a book. Usually an author has to convince me to like their characters but this one was so easy. I just love her.The antagonist is perfectly horrible."
1296,954151031,did not like it,"I checked out this audiobook because I knew it was a bestseller a few decades ago, and I figured that since it was a bestseller, it must be good. Oh, how wrong we can be at times.I hate to slam books because I know authors put a lot of work into them, but I have to do it this time. This book was bad for so many reasons. First, there was a lot of repetition and needless detail. A couple hundred pages could have been cut from the manuscript without changing the story at all. How many times did we need to hear why Broud hated Ayla? Or that people feared Creb? And for people who didn’t speak with their mouths, the author certainly gave us a lot of redundant chitchat.If these had been the books only sins, I could have forgiven them. But here’s the thing, the author created this horrible, abusive, downright evil society and then wanted us to like and care about the characters.Here’s the life of the clan in a nutshell: They horribly abuse women. Women have no rights, can only speak to a man if he allows it, can be beaten or killed for any small offence, (Such as not getting pregnant, making a man lose face, disobeying a man, being insolent to a man, resisting rape, or not killing her baby when the leader tells her to.) Clan life also includes cannibalism (but they do it with the utmost reverence—the author tells us), abortion, infanticide, rape, incest, dancing that verges on erotic (the author tells us twice in case we forgot it the first time) and drug use. A woman is required to have sex with any man who wants it, and free love is practiced. They view sex as a natural practice, the author told us more than once, and no one in the clan thought anything of children having sex. Hello--creepy.Ayla is an outsider, whose parents were killed in an earthquake. The clan found her when she was five and near death. Iza, the medicine woman takes her in and makes Ayla her daughter.So the story is about Ayla learning clan ways and getting beaten regularly (and at one point nearly to death) by Broud, the clan chief’s son.I kept reading/listening because I figured the story was going to be about Ayla escaping from the clan and their abusive ways. I thought she would go find her only people.In Ayla’s tenth year, Broud rapes Ayla brutally and every day. Her clan mother and father know this—everyone knows it because it happens out in public. And no one does anything to help her. They don’t think it’s wrong—because women have no rights.Okay, at that point in the book, nothing could redeem these people, and I only kept listening because I was hoping that a comet would strike them all, wipe them out, and Ayla would get to move on. But nom it just kept getting worse. She gets pregnant, has a baby that looks like her (not of the clan) and so she runs away so she won’t have to kill it.At last, I thought, Ayla has seen this society as evil and will escape from them. No again. She goes back, repentant and ready to die for her disobedience. Really? Come on.And the author keeps putting us in the mind of the Ayla’s mother and father and the clan leader—telling us that they’re really good people.No, no they aren’t. They’re horrible. It made me cringe that Ayla felt so bad about doing things that disappointed them. Like, Oh, I was so wrong to disappoint you with some minor offense, and now you feel badly about having to curse me.I don’t think you can always draw conclusions about an author from their books, but this one made me wonder if the author suffered an abusive background and was trying to work out—and justify—the abuse. I’ve heard more than one victim defending their abusers. They have a hard time understanding that their abusers are bad people and they themselves shouldn’t have to live with the abuse.Luckily the audiobook was easy to skip through, so I didn’t have to listen through every minute of the book to find out what happened. I wanted to know if Ayla ever came t her senses and got away from these people.Spoiler Alert: Broud becomes chief, takes her child away from her and demotes her father. When she complains/begs him not to do this he has the clan magician put a death curse on her.I should take a moment to explain the death curse. Even though the clan has been around for 100,000 years, they aren’t all that bright. For example, they have never figured out that sex causes babies or that a baby inherits characteristics from his mother and father. You would have thought someone during all of those centuries would have noticed this basic part of life, but apparently not. They do, however, think that if the magician curses you, you are instantly dead. The person they still see standing in front of them is an evil spirit who is there only to lure them into the spirit world. They won’t talk to, acknowledge, or touch the evil spirit.So in the last scene when Ayla is cursed, she knows she has to go find somewhere else to live. At this point, I would have been happy had she taken out her sling and used it on Broud. That would have been a satisfying ending. After all, she’s good with the sling and she’s already dead, so what can the clan do to her? They think she’s a spirit so they’re afraid to touch her. Perfect revenge.In fact, she should have killed Broud, and then taken her baby before leaving.The author, unfortunately, overlooked this overdue but nonetheless satisfying ending in favor of more victimhood. Ayla challenges Broud to hit her. (That will make up for, um, nothing.) She tells him he can take everything away from her including her baby, but he can’t make her die. Well, I guess that showed him. He totally got his comeuppance. The End.I really have no idea why this book was so popular."
1296,114580211,it was amazing,"Ayla is just 5 years old when she loses her entire family and everyone she has ever known to a cave in caused by an earthquake. Completely alone and without the skills she needs to survive she wanders aimlessly until she is injured by a cave lion and she is close to death when members of the Clan of the Cave Bear find her. Iza is a medicine woman and although the child is one of the ""Others"" (a Cro-Magnon human) and very different to the Clan (who are Neanderthals) she is unable to walk away from a child who is in pain. With the permission of the Clan leader Brun she takes the young child with her and helps to heal her wounds. Ayla now finds herself living amongst a people who are very different to the ones she was born to, first she must learn to communicate but the hardest thing is to adopt their traditions and behave in the manor that is expected of her. She grows to love those who care for her but she makes an enemy of Broud, the future leader of the Clan, which is sure to cause problems for her in the future.I have been a huge fan of this series for about 10 years now and despite the fact I've read all of the books at least 5 times I still love The Clan of the Cave Bear as much as I did the very first time I read it. Set around 35,000 years ago at the time of the last Ice Age this is the first book in an epic series that follows Ayla on her journey from child to adult. This series is like taking a step back in time and it feels like you have experienced everything that Ayla goes through right alongside her.Ayla is without a doubt one of my favorite fictional characters, she suffers so much hardship but she never gives in and she always fights to survive. Her life with the Clan isn't easy, their traditions are very different to those she was brought up with and she finds it hard to understand why she isn't allowed to do the things she wants to do. She is adopted by Iza who is an incredibly skilled medicine woman and Creb who is the Clan's Mog-Ur (spiritual leader). Iza and Creb are both fantastic characters, they have taken in a young child despite her differences and do their best to love her and keep her safe. I can assure you you'll never think of Neanderthals in the same way after getting to know the members of the Clan, each of them are so realistic it feels like you have actually met them.Jean M. Auel's descriptions of the Clan's way of life and the land in which they live are fascinating and show the amount of research that has gone into the creation of the series. She manages to impart an incredible amount of information but it is done in such a way that I didn't once feel bored when reading in fact I loved learning about the medicinal uses for plants, the tools they use and how they were made. Although this series is marketed as young adult I would recommend it for older teens and adults. The Clan of the Cave Bear does contain a rape scene that some may find difficult to read but this isn't included for dramatic effect, it fits in well with the story and I believe was something that needed to be included. This series shows all sides of life both good and bad which is one of the things that makes it so interesting to read. I have no doubt that after reading this story you will be just as hooked as I am and I'm sure you'll end up devouring the rest of the series!"
1296,39130786,it was amazing,"I'll never forget the first time I read this book. I was in the 5th grade. It was sitting around my house - my mom is an English teacher, so we always had plenty of books lying around in various stages of reading completion - and the synopsis on the back cover caught my attention. Some pretty advanced themes for a 5th grader, as my teacher Mr. Konezney mentioned to my mother upon seeing me read this book in school - but it was my very first emotional connection to fictional characters. Ayla, Creb, Brun - I remember them all. I sobbed at the end of the book, not just because it was emotional, but I remember the sadness that I would never again be able to read this book with new eyes. I read it several times afterwards, but I haven't picked it up in years. I wonder if it would hold up as well now, but I almost want to leave it as I remember it just in case. The other books in the series are fine, but not nearly as strong in my opinion. I've heard the movie is terrible, but then what would you expect from a movie starring Darryl Hannah? "
1296,139349684,really liked it,"This story was great! As I was reading I totally lost my self in the story. The descriptions and well researched information took me back in time and I could almost hear the grunts, the crackle of the fire and smell the meat roasting! Sometimes though, details were a little much and I felt anxious to get on with the story when the author was explaining the tedious steps involved in making a weapon or such things like that. After finishing the book I have a yearning for simplicity. I set out to enjoy nature and nurish my body with the earth. My fitness trainers have been bothering me to try this new Paleo diet, (where we eat like cave men,) and after reading the descriptions of Ayla's lean long body I have decided to try it! "
1296,3294847,it was amazing,"I love these books and have read some in the Earth's Children series many times because I love the detailed descriptions of their way of life. I actually started reading them in the 4th or 5th grade. I loved reading about how they hunted, gathered and stored their food, made clothing and jewelry, and the contrasts between the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon in those aspects. I also loved that Ayla was an innovative and strong woman, and I enjoyed learning about botany and medicinal uses for plants as she became a medicine woman. That being said, the story can get a little goofy and redundant in the later books, and I can see how some may call it ""prehistoric porn"" as the author is as descriptive when it comes to Ayla's sexual encounters as she is in describing the making of a healing poultice of mustard seeds or a ochre tunic."
1296,147988146,it was amazing,This is an amazing story and series. I didn't think the topic would be interesting but I'm thankful I was wrong. Jean Auel is masterful in her ability to create a story that has you transported in time and live vicariously in Ayla's world. I found myself gripping the steering wheel in my car as I listened to her struggle for survival.You will not be disappointed. This is truly a 5-star rated experience. 
1296,1183856,it was amazing,"This is a great novel; it’s a real masterpiece. I love the whole series but I think this is by far the best book in it, and it stands on its own although I became completely hooked and I’ve eagerly awaited every new book in the series, and I really hope Auel finishes this series! I really admire these epic books. I appreciate stories that are historical fiction or fantasy where a complex society and intricate details about the lives of the inhabitants are described. I feel that I learned so much about the evolution of and differences between Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon people, and could discern homo-sapien’s traits and personalities in both groups which made it a fun as well as emotionally involving read. I loved everything about Ayla and much about her new tribe as well. Loved learning about how herbs and foods and medicines were used and prepared, and was surprised and excited by the expertise shown. Know the “facts” here involve some conjecture, but Auel has done more than adequate research, in my opinion."
1296,1188317034,it was amazing,"Wow! That was a great adventure of a read! I truly loved and enjoyed everything about this book. It was unlike anything I have ever read before. I was completely drawn into the story right from the very beginning until the last three, heartbreaking words that end the book. I loved the main character Ayla; one of the bravest woman characters I've ever come across in a story. No love interest or triangle that usually comes along with every story where the main character is female. This story was about a woman who is trying to survive, and doesn't let anyone or anything stand in her way to learn about the world around her, to love and care for those she loves and to dare to be as brave and strong as any man. A book I highly recommend!"
1296,62059449,did not like it,"""Hello I am a researchere who has given up my life to study neanderthals and my story telling skills are roughly equivalent to those of my subjects""should be Jean's introduction to her work, ""as I believe fiction should be written in the form of a dull and tedious encyclopaedia."""
1296,1029845445,it was amazing,"No this book is not perfect and perhaps it might seem a bit immature in places to some readers, but in the long run, this will turn out to be one of the books that you may end up thinking of as a classic.There are 6 books in the series:☛The Clan of the Cave Bear, 1980☛The Valley of Horses, 1982☛The Mammoth Hunters, 1985☛The Plains of Passage, 1990☛The Shelters of Stone, 2002☛The Land of Painted Caves, 2011While every book seems to go a bit downhill from this first one (at least the last 3 books seem to in my opinion) they actually provide a platform in which Ayla our main character grows.This first book truly shows how the author had researched the Ice Age ( Europe during the Upper Paleolithic Age) to write this and you can tell that she did her own physical research too.The story is an interesting one, beginning with an earthquake to finds our main character, a Cro-Magnon child lost at about 5 years old. After being mauled by a cave lion, she is found by a group of Neanderthals and her life is saved.She now grows up in a very difficult situation which ends up sort of - modern man vs prehistoric man. If you read this book, towards the end you will see why I say it like that.The growth of the character Ayla shows very dramatically in this first novel, especially if you consider she was only about 11 or so when she had her first child. Throughout the series, you will see her growing more and more as she goes off to find ""her own people"".Most people felt that the last book was a cop out, I happened to find it a gentle conclusion after so many long years of waiting. I hadn't been happy with the last several books so the last one did not surprise me at all.I am now off to re-read the entire series!Happy Reading!"
1296,330832151,it was amazing,"I really liked this book so much that I even acquired a copy, however, after reading it the first time, I felt deceived. Seeing as 150 people shelved this as ""romance"", I started it and expected you know, a love story. I assumed Broud would be her love interest since he was a main character and guessed he and Ayla would have an enemies-to-lovers plot line or something. He treated her really badly (understatement) but I let it go because I assumed he'd have to beg for her forgiveness (hero-groveling is a weakness of mine). I get to the second to last page (there are 512 in this book, so I had been waiting for quite some time) desperately anticipating the moment Broud realizes his love for Ayla (they say hate is like love, don't they?) and then what does he do? He attempts to murder her..........@#$%!!!Seriously, people, I know the rest of this series focuses on romance, but this book does not, so please don't shelve it as such! It's misleading."
1296,1396830038,it was amazing,"EL MEJOR DE LA SAGA. Sufrí gran consternación cuando supe que no era real realmente verídico. Fue de mis primeras lecturas, hace varios años, y entonces decían que los Cromagnon y los Neantherdal no se habían mezclado, aunque con gran alborozo hace algún tiempo las revistas científicas dijeron que sí.De todos modos, es un libro PRECIOSO, MARAVILLOSO, ABSOLUTAMENTE DESGARRADOR Y A LA VEZ ESPERANZADOR. Lo recuerdo aún como si fuera ayer. En especial, Iza, la señora que la acoge... me acuerdo de su nombre hasta el día de hoy y lloro.Este libro es TAN BUENO que luego me leí TODOS LOS OTROS aunque fueron siendo progresivamente peores. Incluso leí los que salieron años después. Siempre eché de menos a Iza e incluso a Thonolan (libro 2) (también me acuerdo de su nombre, jaja). La misma Ayla nunca me gusta tanto más adelante como en esta primera entrega."
1296,1239240635,liked it,"People will lie to you about this book. They don't realize that they're lying, but they are.

You can read why I came to this decision here.In the meantime, you can read the entire review at Smorgasbook"
1296,2768344,it was ok,"Ugh. Throughout my childhood this book sat off-limits on my parents' bookshelf. As the kid who read White Fang 9 times in one year, I really wanted to jump on its primitive-wilderness-and-spunky-heroine train, but I was not allowed to do so - apparently some of its scenes were deemed 'too graphic' by my parents (Now I know why). I finally bought it this fall at a discount paperback book store and have been unable to finish it in a year. The prose, ugh. The nature-porn cheesiness, double ugh. The heavy-handed foreshadowing, triple ugh. Book of my childhood dreams, you have let me down."

1296,2424700026,liked it,"It took me TWO months to read this book. TWO WHOLE MONTHS and I am still super confused about how I feel. On one hand, the premise and execution are awe-inspiring and I have to give it to Jean Auel for her expansive research during a (pre-internet) time when so little was known about the Pre-historic era. BUT.But the misogynistic culture depicted in the clan made it extremely difficult for me to read. I am not sure if it was known during the time Auel was researching the Earth's Children series but the societies of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons were actually egalitarian. I have read my share of misogynistic literature but TCoftCB was completely a different beast to handle. Then there's the problem with Ayla, the grandmother of every Mary Sue in literature. She's blonde, she's tall and slim (but of course she thinks she's ugly), she can hunt (women aren't allowed to hunt cuz they are inferior), she has the strongest totem (except for Broud's) she's an awesome medicine woman, everyone loves her (except Broud, the prehistoric ratbastard how dare he!!!!!!!!). She can do everything WOW!!!11!!!!!! I don't know if Auel intended it but TCotCB has subtle racist undertones and it really prevented me from fully enjoying the book. (not to mention the rape and regular beatings- this book is a white supremacist's wet dream)"
1296,1974401183,did not like it,"Ik vind geschiedenis altijd wel interessant. Helaas is dit boek niks voor mij. Na een tijdje weet je wel wat hun voedsel is, welke wapens ze gebruiken en hoe de verhoudingen en regels zijn in de stam. Uiteindelijk vond ik het maar langdradig worden en werd ik er zelfs slaperig van. Nee wat dat betreft had ik liever een kort en bondig verhaal over deze stam gelezen in plaats van dat het zo erg uitgerekt is."
1296,2600280955,really liked it,"Enjoyed rereading this one. Now I can slowly move on to rereading the rest of the series. I feel a little guilty rereading books when I have so many unread books staring at me from my shelf, but it is what it is! Although The Clan of the Cave Bear is the most recognizable of the Earth's Children books, it's not my favorite. The stories just get better and more intricate and at least for me-more interesting as the series continues.

1296,1313388316,really liked it,"This was good! I wasn't expecting a book about cavemen clans to be so full of drama and politics! There were parts that broke my heart, made me angry and made sense even though it's hard situations to stomach. I will definitely continue with the series after the ending of this one. Really good!"
1296,29886414,it was amazing,"The story begins with an earthquake in the first few pages of the book that leaves a 5 year old girl alone, orphaned and wandering, on the brink of death. Luckily for her, the same quake destroyed the cave of a clan of cavemen, and they are also wandering, in search of a new home. A pregnant woman comes across the unconcious body of the girl, and despite her physical differences asks, and receives permission, to carry and tend to the girl. As ugly and strange to the clan as the girl seems, she brings them luck and they very soon find a new cave, even better than their last. Iza, the woman who found her is allowed to adopt her. Iza has been left a widow by the quake, but is a very powerful medicine woman, so is provided for by Creb, the highly esteemed Mogur, or magician, of the clan who also happens to be her sibling. It's very fortunate for Ayla that these are the kind people she ends up with. Not everyone of the clan accepts, trusts, or even likes her, simply because she IS so different and so worthy of fear and distrust.As Ayla grows and learns the customs, language and ways of the clan, her life is hard. She is almost a different species than them. She is much farther up the evolutionary ladder, so finds it very hard to fit into the mold they consider appropriate for women. She is proud, strong, very intelligent, and able to make leaps of logic that often get her into trouble with her adopted people. She secretly learns to hunt which is strictly forbidden to women. This is just one more infraction, in a long list of them, that fuels the hatred Broud, the leader's son, feels for Ayla. She is punished for this, but later is allowed to continue hunting. Through her differences, Ayla becomes a self-sufficient woman, able to take care of herself. This is a foreign concept to the clan, as their skills are firmly divided by sex, with females being no more able to learn male tasks than they are to learn the female's. Ayla can do both.As the years pass, Ayla is trained By Iza, alongside her daughter, to become a medicine woman. Ayla is not only a quick learner, but an inuitive one. She can not only recall what she has been taught, but devise new treatments and medicines that would never occur to Iza. Ayla has a child, but is left unmated. The story ends, wide open for book two, with Broud, the new clan leader, cursing Ayla to death. Fortunately, we know she will survive, even without the help and comfort of the clan. Ayla can take care of herself.It's amazing how much information Auel is able to fit into this book without it coming across as a list of plants, animals and customs. Tons of information is imparted, and we are given a vivid look at what life would have looked like in Ayla's time. The long descriptions never come across as dry or boring, but instead leave me with more questions. This is one of those rare books that leave me looking things up, poring over encyclopedias, scouring Wikipedia, anything for just a little more detail. There are many fortunate coincidences, leaps of logic and just plain lucky happenings that are a bit far-fetched, but I was able to overlook these because they advanced the story and made it possible for Auel to give us such a rich look at what life may have been like. So much happens in such a few short years, but it needs to, so that the foundation is laid for the rest of the series."

Fantastic! Phenomenal! The ultimate in creative, imaginative story telling.
 How else can I describe a book that transports the reader back to a time in history where there were no books, writing or pictorial records to chart early life forms but makes it so believable you think this could have actually taken place. What an extraordinary imagination author Jean M. Auel tapped into by taking the fossils that we all have seen in museums and the numerous pieces of scientific hypothetical information and forming a pre-historical fiction around them. It's amazing the details of the flora, fauna and terrain of the prehistoric earth in general that was described in such a way that the reader really is left feeling as if this novel was part story, part history lesson.When I learned about this book some years ago, I was intrigued. I thought it would be more Fantasy fiction but since I'm not adverse to this genre I thought I'd give it a try. I did eventually pick it up on one of my many book hauls. And then it sat. It's a thick book. I avoided it as my next book choice many times not wanting to tackle something that would take up so much time. I for some reason pictured the Hollywood version of scruffy cave people with shaggy hanging furs and bones in their hair. I avoided it because of this. I categorized it as Fantasy and I seemed to never be in the mood for that. There's a lyric in a song by hip hop artist Talib Kweli where he makes reference to The Clan of the Cave Bear. Hearing that song would remind me that I needed to read the book. But I kept dancing and didn't. Sometimes it would make it off of the shelf into a book line up and just lost out to other books that I was feeling at the time. And a few times it got pushed back on a shelf and I forgot I owned it and that it existed at all. For all these avoidances, I say to The Clan of the Cave Bear, I'm very sorry. I had no idea you were so good. It look for the political drama of my country's election for me to not only remember this book but go seeking it out as a distraction. I joked with friends that I didn't even want to live in 2016 right now. I grabbed this book and have gone back to Cave man times to hold onto my sanity. And I've enjoyed every single lost in time moment with this book. I'm glad I stopped judging this book by its cover or my stereotypical assumption of cave people. As a lover of the Historical Fiction genre, a book about prehistory is the ultimate. I'll tell those who haven't read it. It's not Hollywood bones and shaggy carpet clothing at all. It's realistic. It's engaging. It's engrossing. It's tribal. And you finish the book knowing you want to continue to the next book. I actually went out and purchased the next book when I was half way through this first one. I don't have that great luck with series, so I hope it does continue to carry me through to the last book. I'm giving it 5 stars. It was very entertaining, transportive and as an author, what a project."
1296,2034665886,really liked it,"To the Clan of the Cave Bear....Screw you and your totems. And that's putting it nicely. Where do I begin?Of all the books that I have read this one takes the cake in pissing me off. I've read books that have made me laugh, frustrated, annoyed, dumbfounded, wiser, and lastly cry like a baby. But NEVER have I read a book that has pissed me off soooo much I wanted to build a device that allows you to step into books and bring them to life, all for the sole purpose of killing EVERY character that was mentioned. Never, until this day. Oh yes ladies and gents, I wanted to get a B52 Bomber and blow that cave away into another timeline. Oh yes I am still very much angry. Our ""beloved"" Ayla is separated from her original family and left on her own. Until she is found by another tribe where she is raised as one of their own. She's the outcast guys and this book will tell you of all her trials and triumphs. There is so much I want to say and get out but it would only spoil the book for others. Let me just leave you with this. Your inner feminist will come out all guns blazing! I literally HATED man for 48 hour period. This book leaves no one safe! Every character you loved at the beginning of the book, trust me, you will hate at the end. Even Ayla. When deaths started dishing out like candy I didn't even cry. Actually I remember being disappointed that it didn't happen sooner. Call me heartless, call me cruel, but screw it I don't care. "
1296,31607528,really liked it,"The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first in Jean Auel’s Earth’s Children series, and it’s an exciting way to begin. The book is a coming-of-age story for a young girl, Ayla, living during the Ice Age who is orphaned during an Earthquake. Ayla is adopted by The Clan of the Cave Bear, although she clearly is not “Clan,” as she looks, acts, and communicates very differently. The story is clearly a work of fantasy, as there are obvious factual inaccuracies; however, the quality of Auel’s writing makes it easy to become absorbed in the story and forget reality. Ayla’s tale is on of moving from childhood to adulthood, Auel masterfully weaves vivid details about the setting, while keeping the reader engaged in the plot. Each character in the novel goes through his or her own individual struggle because of Ayla’s difference, yet because of the Auel’s writing style, it is easy for the reader to understand why each character is faced with difficult choices, rather than automatically siding with the main character. There is also depth to the descriptions that Auel uses, which makes it easy to understand the love between Ayla and her adopted parents—Creb and Iza—the intensity of Broud’s hatred toward Ayla, and the heart wrenching pain that is inflicted upon her. Overall, the book is a fairly easy, but very captivating read. "
1296,841824930,really liked it,"This was a very interesting novel. This is set during the late Pleistocene epoch and geographically seems to be set in the crimean peninsula, and speculates on Neanderthal culture and their interactions with Early Modern Humans.The plot is quite simple, Ayla is an orphaned 5 year old Cro-Magnon girl who gets adopted by a Neanderthal clan, clan of the cave bear. The rest of the story follows her life in the clan, and her struggle to fit in.We know very little about Neanderthals and their lives, but a lot of evidence is being unearthed lately which point towards a sophisticated culture for the Neanderthals. They used tools, personal ornaments and had burial customs. They presence of red ochre in their graves points towards the notion that they must have had some kind of spirituality. It is clear that the author did a lot of research and she managed to construct a very interesting culture for the Neanderthals. She gives them a genetic memory and a very interesting religion. Ayla is a wonderful character, and the hierarchical clan structure with women playing a secondary role gives her a lot of depth.The biggest problem with the novel is the author's tendency to slip into long-winded descriptions that are totally incongruent with the narrative."
1296,57216364,liked it,"I wonder how accurate this book is. It's full of interesting descriptions but i really don't think Neanderthals were this specialized. They did have funerals and stuff like that. Still, it's an interesting read. Ayla struggles to fit in but she can't because she's Cro Magnom and evolved differently. She can vocalize, cry and she's a blond bombshell. Her life is mostly full of frustration and agony but she does have loving adoptive parents in the form of the medicine woman and spiritual guide who take her in and raise her.5/1/17Trying to reread It is frustrating because I am sure it's very prehistorically inaccurate and plus there are unfortunately implications to someone white and blonde being the replacement and better version of an entire species. Ew. Still. It is interesting and sweet in parts but depressing since clearly many people nowadays haven't evolved!Though evolution doesn't work that way!"

Καλοδουλεμένο και πρωτότυπο ως προς την θεματολογία του, τριτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση από την οπτική γωνία διάφορων ηρώων, και με λεπτομέρειες που αντί να κουράζουν γίνονται πολύ ενδιαφέρουσες. Επίσης η δυναμική ηρωίδα του, παρόλο που δεν υπάρχει περίπτωση να συμπάσχεις με τις εμπειρίες τις, κάλλιστα μπορείς να απορροφηθείς από την ιστορία της και από την προσωπικότητα της."
1296,31494749,it was amazing,I loved this book. Ayla is incredible.
1296,1593501811,really liked it,"Human evolution is a matter of great interest to me, which is why a book that gives an insight into the lives of the first people and the Neanderthals is appealing to me, especially in the last few years when important discoveries have been made in this field. Of course my objection to this book was the fact that it is quite old, written at a time when there were different scientific perceptions about this issue. By reading as expected I have found that scientific theories that are considered outdated in our time are depicted but, surprising, there are also things that went against what the scientists considered fact then but today they have been proven right beyond any doubt.The author tells the story of Ayla, a little girl who loses her mother and wandering ends up with a group of Neanderthals who reluctantly adopt her. The differences of her species, in terms of both appearance and intelligence, are becoming more and more obvious and make her acceptance a very difficult thing. That is why she makes every effort to adapt to their society, learning the complicated rules of conduct that were set thousands of years before. A very interesting story that takes us to such a distant past and tells a lot about things that still concern us today, such as the need for acceptance and the fear of many people against change. But what made me the strongest impression in this book and made me appreciate it is the fact that the author taking elements from many different real cultures and adding many of her own creates a very complex culture for Neanderthals, with their habits, their customs, their religious beliefs and, in general, the way they perceived the world through their less complex minds.Η ανθρώπινη εξέλιξη είναι ένα θέμα που με ενδιαφέρει πολύ, για αυτό ένα βιβλίο που δίνει μία εικόνα της ζωής των πρώτων ανθρώπων και των Νεάντερταλ αναμενόμενα μου είναι ελκυστικό, ειδικά τα τελευταία χρόνια που σε αυτόν τον τομέα έχουν γίνει σημαντικές ανακαλύψεις. Βέβαια η ένστασή μου για αυτό το βιβλίο ήταν το γεγονός ότι είναι αρκετά παλιό, γραμμένο δηλαδή σε μία εποχή όπου υπήρχαν διαφορετικές επιστημονικές αντιλήψεις για αυτό το θέμα. Διαβάζοντας το αναμενόμενα διαπίστωσα ότι αποτυπώνονται σε αυτό επιστημονικές θεωρίες που στην εποχή μας θεωρούνται ξεπερασμένες, περιέργως, όμως, υπάρχουν και πράγματα που πήγαιναν κόντρα σε αυτά που τότε οι επιστήμονες θεωρούσαν δεδομένα αλλά σήμερα έχουν αποδειχθεί σωστά πέρα από κάθε αμφιβολία.Η συγγραφέας μας αφηγείται την ιστορία της Ayla, ενός μικρού κοριτσιού που χάνει τη μητέρα της και περιπλανώμενη καταλήγει σε μία ομάδα Νεάντερταλ που διστακτικά την υιοθετεί. Οι διαφορές του είδους της, όσο στο θέμα της εμφάνισης, όσο και της νοημοσύνης, όμως, γίνονται όλο και περισσότερο εμφανείς και κάνουν την αποδοχή της μία πολύ δύσκολη υπόθεση. Για αυτό καταβάλλει κάθε δυνατή προσπάθεια να προσαρμοστεί στην κοινωνία τους, μαθαίνοντας τους περίπλοκους κανόνες συμπεριφοράς που την καθορίζουν χιλιάδες χρόνια. Μία πολύ ενδιαφέρουσα ιστορία που μας μεταφέρει τη ζωή σε ένα τόσο μακρινό παρελθόν και λέει πολλά για πράγματα που μας απασχολούν ακόμα και σήμερα όπως την ανάγκη για αποδοχή και το φόβο πολλών ανθρώπων απέναντι στην αλλαγή. Αυτό, όμως, που μου έκανε μεγαλύτερη εντύπωση σε αυτό το βιβλίο και με έκανε να το εκτιμήσω είναι το γεγονός ότι η συγγραφέας παίρνοντας στοιχεία από πολλές διαφορετικές πραγματικές κουλτούρες και προσθέτοντας πολλά δικά της δημιουργεί μία ιδιαίτερα περίπλοκη κουλτούρα για τους Νεάντερταλ, με τον τρόπο ζωής τους, τις συνήθειές τους, τα έθιμά τους, τις θρησκευτικές τους πεποιθήσεις και γενικότερα τον τρόπο που αντιλαμβάνονταν τον κόσμο μέσα από το λιγότερο περίπλοκο μυαλό τους."
1296,2605347764,did not like it,Questo libro mi ha fatto scendere talmente tanto il latte alle ginocchia che ero lì a fare il tifo per una catastrofe naturale che mi togliesse di dosso 'sta manica di disadattati..Sono andata avanti solo perché la narrazione di Sandra Burr merita e rende tutto questo pappone infinito molto più digeribile!
1296,2405418942,it was amazing,WOW! I can not believe how much I loved this book. This was completely out of my comfort zone. But I am Anxiously awaiting book 2 to come in the mail. 
1296,1773452906,it was amazing,"Incredible. Ayla is about 5 years old when a massive earthquake leaves her motherless and alone. She is found by a group of Neanderthals and adopted into their Clan. As a child born to the Others (a Cro Magnon group living in another area), Ayla's differences are always apparent to everyone else, but she grows to be a respected and integral part of the Clan. What. A. Character. Ayla's story isn't without struggle and difficulty, but it also contains strength and love and a ferocity that I absolutely adore. She's way up there in my new favorite characters list and I'm excited to watch her continue to grow in the subsequent installments in this series. From start to finish in this installment, Ayla ages only a few years, but during the course of that time, she becomes a woman in the eyes of the Clan. This means that she undergoes many things, changes, and events that we do much later in our lives in this day and age. I LOVE her. And honestly, I can't remember ever reading anything from this prehistoric time period before so I was not sure what to expect when I began this book. With the earthquake event happening in the opening chapter, I was immediately hooked. The story never let up, even with the few instances of repetition scattered throughout. I was never bored. The descriptions of the culture and customs of these people and their ways of life fascinated me. It felt obvious to me that the author took great pains to research details and present them as accurately as possible. (After finishing the book, I sought out interviews with Mrs. Auel and found where she talked about her research-very cool.)The part that I easily loved most about this story was its characterization. I was able to form easy connections with them even though there was ~30,000 years between their time and mine. Sure, they are wildly different from me in terms of customs, religion, ways of life, etc. - but these characters have emotions and behaviors that are very much on par with us today. This is something that I've never thought about before...until now, when I've actually taken the time to think about this time period, these people, and the challenges that they faced when compared with the comforts of living in this period of history. I had no trouble at all visualizing this book in my head as I read and found myself wanting to read it anytime that I couldn't be. This book was a complete joy to read (and listen to, as I added the audiobook) and I know that I'll be rereading it in the future. Audiobook Notes: The audiobook format of The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel is published by Brilliance Audio and is 19 hours, 36 minutes, Unabridged. It is narrated by Sandra Burr who was new to me. She was a fine narrator and I became very used to her reading for Ayla and the other characters. Not my very favorite, but certainly enjoyable. I'll read/listen again in the future, for sure. "
1296,355340045,did not like it,"It's amazing to me all the crazy comments made around here...all the brouhaha and spittle dumped at the doorstep of this dowdy, undistinguished mass-market paperback series ..all the hare-brained theorizing going on this book's Goodreads page... everyone sharpening their axe for this-or-that pet theory they're harboring....And so far I see NO ONE even mentioning that Jean M. Auel is not even the originator of the kernel at the base of this tale. She merely put a sexy-gloss on it; put a fashion-plate heroine at the front of it; and turned the whole thing into a rather cheap historical fiction franchise intended for supermarket check-out aisle racks.That credit for the fundamental idea behind the larger story, though (cro-magnon culture vs neanderthal culture) should go --if to anyone--none other than William Golding. Heard of Golding? Have you? Yes, 'Lord of the Flies'--that William Golding. We're talking a real author now, an author of note. Auel surely knew of Golding's novel; and not for the least of which reason is that he already advances the idea of an orphan from one tribe being adopted by a tribe from the other evolutionary branch.So if you want to 'trash' Jean M. Auel and take-her-to-task and shout 'hooey!' to all her ideas; you're wielding your pitchforks in the wrong direction. Take your blabber to William Golding. His ability--and his vision of how to tell this tale--are more than a match for all this gum-flapping, ballyhoo, and finger-pointing. First of course, ya gotta read his novel though. And it's not an 'easy' read like the works of Auel. The title of his work is 'The Inheritors'. There are other authors who took on this theme (Bjorn Kurten, etc) but Golding is surely the best. For those of you who want a neolithic-age plot narrated with 'more authentic language' this is where you'll find it. For those of you who want a 'more realistic presentation of female roles' in a prehistoric tribe, this has it for you. So go ahead...go on, go home, go do your homework... and then come back here and foolishly spout off more contemporary babble about racism and sexism and chauvinism. "
1296,328027856,it was ok,"I don’t give up on a book easily. I can count on one hand the times this has happened. But this book and I have come to a parting of the ways. And this is sad, because I really wanted to like this book.I’ve always been curious about The Clan of the Cave Bear. I love the idea of setting a sweeping epic story during the time of cavemen. And the covers for this series by Jean M. Auel are absolutely beautiful and practically call to readers, promising adventure within. On a recent trip to Manhattan, I found an old paperback copy at The Strand which was autographed and figured it was finally time to dig in.The writing is fine. Utilitarian in places, but the pacing and flow and economy of words is polished. The story, itself, begins well enough– a Homosapien girl loses her tribe and is adopted by a clan of Cro-Magnons on the great steppes of the Mammoth fields. But as interesting a world as Auel creates, I practically had to force myself to read on. Three hundred pages in, it began to feel like work. Why? This story has no ticking clock. Her protagonist, Ayla, is not given a goal or mission, other than to try to fit in–or not–as a member of the Clan. As a reader, we don’t really know why we’re reading, other than to understand Auel’s theories on Ancient society. There is simply nothing driving the narration.To me, this book read as an experiment by a great historian to write a novel in order to get other people as excited in the things she studied as she was. And, given the success of the book in the 80′s, it worked. But it didn’t work for me. Unfortunately."
1296,41076426,liked it,"This is the first of a series of four books based in Europe during the Ice Age that follows the journey of Ayla, a woman of apparently many talents and abilities.While I was mesmerized by the story, I was bothered by some reviews (not just on Goodreads) that claim it is a racist series. Sometimes reviews ruin reading... The fact that I was aware enough to spend time looking for racist overtones distracted me. Upon reading, here is what I decided. If I can read the book and enjoy it, anyone should be able to enjoy it (probably not archaeologists or anthropologists though). The book is in the fiction section. Yes, the author does not make it clear where reality ends and where fantasy picks up. Yes, there are some inconsistencies to the portrayal of Neanderthals, but it was also written prior to a few major discoveries. Either way, it is still fiction- never claiming to be fact. As for the blue-eyed, blond haired mammoth hunters... Well, This book is about ancient Europe, not ancient North America, so I think it is easy for an author to visualize early Cro-Magnons to look European. I can't prove they weren't blue-eyed, so I just kept reading.Side note: When my boyfriend read the back cover of the book, he raised an eyebrow and said, ""Blond hair and blue eyes?..."" I just sighed.That is my two cents."
1296,1153072964,it was amazing,Loved this book.
1296,2509670161,liked it,"Objectively, this is probably a terrible novel. It's terrible in some ways, without a doubt. It is overlong and oddly paced. It is repetitive. Its omniscient narration justifies and excuses a lot about behaviour with biological, reductionist evo-psych mumbo-jumbo. It is, if not explicitly racist, then at least enamoured of whiteness: its racially-ambiguous Neanderthals function as a darker, ""primitive,"" maladapted backdrop against which the whiter-than-white, blue-eyed, blonde-haired, highly intelligent heroine can stand out all the starker. And the less said about its representation of rape, the better - it is very much an old-fashioned and offensive plot device here, serving to show who the villain and who the saintly martyred heroine is.At the same time, even now, reading it as an adult with much more advanced critical skills, I cannot help being engrossed in the story. It is an old narrative structure of heaping misfortunes upon the heroine to turn her into a diamond of womanhood, and I see all that's wrong with it, and yet it's just so, so compelling to read. In addition, Ayla, for all her obvious narrative not-like-other-girlness (which, granted, is a story fact - not many homo sapiens girls get raised by Neanderthals!), is relatively complex and granted a lot of agency. She discovers paternity and sexual basis of reproduction! She modifies hunting techniques! She designs a bra! (Yes, she is a beautiful, slim, tall, large-bosomed blonde doctor, a character with superpowers beyond what she could feasibly have. My teen self forgives her for being too perfect, and my 30+ year old self does, too.)The story has some really silly or annoying tendencies, but it also features some truly interesting plot twists or narrative climaxes. I found the last hundred or so pages quite tough to read (what with protagonist's depression and sadness of the story) but the conclusion is rendered quite well. The conflict is resolved in a way that is both seemingly inevitable and satisfying. I particularly liked that Oga and other secondary characters (like Brun and Creb) got to experience some narrative growth by the end.If I had specific shelves for this, I'd rank this ""so bad it's good"". Sort of. If you close one eye.And now I'm off to read my favourite volume. The one with all the domestication of animals and solitary living. YES."
1296,2367368389,did not like it,"I feel quite conflicted about this novel. The premise is what drew me to it. I had never come across a novel set in this particular time period that had as its characters Neanderthal humans and Cro-Magnons. I didn't go into this expecting anything in particular, just curious really about where this was heading. I am impressed by the information that the author has supplied to support the novel's story world: the flora and fauna, the anatomy and physiology of her characters, and the suppositions around what sort of culture and society they had. The protagonist, Ayla, certainly maintained my interest and sympathy, and I actively rooted for her. What I had trouble with was reading the near constant belittlement, powerlessness, violence, and rape of the women in the novel because the author predicated it on the theory that Neanderthals' social structure was misogynistic. To date I believe we still suspect that Neanderthals were patrilocal which isn't advantageous to women in general but I don't know that we know much more about their social structures. Even the evidence for patrilocality seems tenuous. The evidence for our societies being misogynistic though is pretty well entrenched and I can't help but think that the author took the easy way out and just modeled her characters after what she imagined 'we' must have been like back when. She really piled it on on her poor female characters and even Ayla was reduced frequently to a pathetic mess especially in the first third of the novel.Other points of detraction include the writing style that sometimes didn't quite manage to slip seamlessly between the science and the fiction, and the repetition of information. I am curious about (view spoiler)[what happens to Ayla after she leaves. I can't believe she left Durc behind (hide spoiler)]. It is solely this curiosity that might lead me to read the book although I can imagine more rote misogyny leading me to hurl it against the closest wall. In closing, I can't bring myself to say this was an okay read. I did not enjoy it as a whole but I did dig out parts of it that were interesting. See, conflicted. "
1296,1987255698,it was ok,"I don't even know where to start. I know, I'll start with the good. I liked the way the author describes the Clan cooking and eating, making things, and other daily details. It's like the Boxcar Children or Little House on the Prairie or any of those self-sufficiency stories - it gives a cozy feeling. I also liked the ability of the medicine women to heal and help using only what they had at hand ... not that I believed all of it, but again, it was pleasant to read.Okay, that's about it for the good. As for the bad :- Psychic. Mind-melding. Neanderthals. You hear a LOT about Neaderthal brains, particularly the fact that the Clan has ""ancestral memory"" inherited from all the Neanderthals who previously lived before. Do I need to say more?- Actually, I do need to say more about Neanderthal brains. When I read that the Neanderthals don't learn new things because it will make their babies' brains bigger and therefore the women won't be able to give birth, I almost gave up on the book right then and there.- This book was SO repetitive. I think 200 pages could've easily been edited out by removing the fourth, tenth, or hundredth time that a common theme was stated yet again. - Related to the point above, there was way too much ""telling, not showing"". The author is literally TELLING you what happened, what it means, why it happened, and how everyone should feel about it. It's bad enough when the telling regards the characters or their bizarre internal monologues, but it gets downright boring when it's yet another encyclopedia-like dump of information about the environment, the flora and fauna, biology, evolution, or whatever piece of research the author couldn't bear to leave on the editing room floor. - What sealed the two-star review was the ending. No spoilers, but be warned, it just ENDS. After all that repetition and padding and meandering through the day-to-day life of the Clan, it's like the author looked down and realized, ""oh hey, I hit 500 pages! Better wrap this sucker up!"" I will definitely not be continuing with the series."
1296,833750697,liked it,"I should probably start with a caveat. I finished the book less than 20 minutes ago, so my emotions are a little...strong, to say the least. Overall the book is fine. Auel does include quite a bit of detail about the environment and items used by the Clan and how they make all of their tools, which was interesting. As for the social structure and rules...well I didn't care for that as much. In fact it infuriated me on a number of occasions and I wonder where she got the idea for it - research or mostly her own creation. As for the rating, this was going to be a 4 star until the very end. (view spoiler)[ I cannot believe the ending! I nearly threw the book across the room when I was done. Broud has been made leader and makes Ayla his second mate (and really how did he not die?! He's beyond terrible!), and because he is totally horrible he refuses to allow her son to stay and then he says Creb has to move to a hearth that would aggravate his health problems just to spite Ayla. And when Ayla fights to keep Creb at his hearth, he orders the new mog-ur to curse her. An earthquake breaks up the party and kills Creb just cause things weren't crappy enough. And right before the book ends, Ayla is cursed and forced to leave.  (hide spoiler)] Let's just say I'm quite upset and it'll take me a bit before I can start the second book. I enjoyed the interaction and relationships between most of the characters, but overall I'm not sure I'd recommend this book. If you're curious about what life might have been like, it'd probably be better to read a non-fiction book written within the last few years since research is constantly being updated. I'll give it at least one more book because I really like Ayla, but I'm very unhappy with the story thus far. >:("
1296,1230204069,did not like it,"I really wanted to like this one. I thought I would. But after reading the first 50 pages/3 chapters I just can't go on. It's the 6th book I have abandoned in over 4 years. It is long-winded, way too descriptive (lots of telling, no showing), so much repetition, chunks of encyclopedic knowledge thrown in every other page, and when I read about the clan women having the memories from their ancestors and clan members not being able to learn new things because that will increase brain size and their brains won't fit in their skulls and heads increase even more in size and child birth will become impossible, my eyes roll backwards so much it hurts. I have to admit I haven't been in much of a reading mood lately and when I read something I feel extra critical and more easily annoyed by anything I don't like. If I read this a couple of months ago or would read it a couple of months from now, perhaps I would have liked it. Or at least finished it. "
1296,381387888,it was ok,"Forgive me for not liking this book. The subject matter was intriguing (I was an anthropology minor as an undergraduate), but I just could not connect with the main character. The preponderance of asides was kloogy and interrupted the flow of the story. Honestly, my anthropology textbooks were far less boring. The prose seemed too ""clean"" and florid for the subject matter, as well. I give it a reluctant two stars for the subject matter and some little bit of (largely inaccurate) knowledge one might gain from it. Unfortunately, this fragmented information isn't enough to hold the book together. Nor is the plot. Nor are the characters. ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" falls apart like a poorly-excavated fossil."
1296,1569487943,it was amazing,"I find it sad that this story could have been staged in any period of history. The toxic masculinity that leads to Ayla's sufferings is nothing unfamiliar. The attitudes of the men involved in her subjugation are present, if not prevalent, today. Needless to say, this was difficult for me to finish. Ayla's journey made me very uncomfortable. I kept hoping she'd stand up and say, ""No!"" I had to remind myself repeatedly that the story begins in her fifth year. She's known nothing but the strictures of the Clan. She does the one thing she can, and thus achieves nobility and strength her persecutor can only envy."
1296,277052524,did not like it,I couldn't finish it. Ayla and her Mary Sue-ish antics irritated the hell out of me. I'm not going to believe an 8 year old invented everything. Think you're good at anything? You suck compared to her. Screw Ayla.
1296,74376390,it was ok,"If there were other fictional accounts set in the Ice Age, I would have read those instead. But Auel has the market cornered."
1296,2078508629,really liked it,"I am..Pro-Ayla, our book's heroine.Pro-hunting by sling.Pro-medicine woman descriptions and the awesome members of the tribe who support Ayla.Pro-wilderness survival scenes because I loooved books like Julie of the Wolves and Hatchet. I actually wish this had been recommended to me in high school in a similar vein, because this isn't always a middle school read...I am...Anti-Broud and every stupid, cruel sentence he manages to piece together in this book.Anti-violence, especially against women for no reason, although I don't doubt events like this actually happened.Anti-long-winded descriptions about plants and having the plots spelled out for you. But really, not bad.Overall, I'd recommend this if you like pre-history or survivalist fiction books, and turns out, I do! The second half gets HARSH in some parts (violence, childbirth stuff, animal/human sacrifice), so be prepared for that."
1296,2595775434,really liked it,"3.75 starsAyla is only 5-years old when an earthquake happens and her mother is swallowed up. She doesn’t know what to do, but when Iza, a medicine woman, and her Clan find a starving and passed out Ayla, Iza knows she must help. Ayla looks very different from the Clan and she does her best to fit in and be accepted. But Broud, the son of the leader, hates her with a passion and will do anything he can to knock her down. This was really interesting. Not fast-paced, but a time period I’ve not read about before (the Ice Age); I’m actually not sure how much is out there TO read on this time period, to be honest! I had a hard time with the hunting (particularly the pregnant mammoth), but I know they would have had to back then. With the way it ended, I would like to continue with the next book in the series. Even if I wasn't going to read the next book, I can't see myself forgetting this one anytime soon."
1296,1954383069,,"I know so many people love this book, but after 150 pages I'm just bored. I wanted to read more about the characters and their relationships and less about plants, hunting, religious rites etc. I may come back to it sometime. "
1296,644314203,it was amazing,"I love this book...still...after so many years! I still have it, along with all the rest of the books in this Earth's Children series by Jean M. Auel.The Clan of the Cave Bear was given to me many years ago by a friend, and although I was, at the time, a prolific reader of all kinds of books, it was not a book I would normally have gravitated towards as my tastes at that point in time were anything and everything to do with espionage...you know, Nelson De Mille, John Le Carre, Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum, to name a few of the type of reading 'diet' that I was on at the time, and rapidly devouring. Mmmm.Quite a contrast from Clan of the Cave Bear!))!However, my friend told me to just read the first two pages and if I wasn't intrigued enough to read on then she would understand.I think I finished that book in record time and couldn't wait for the follow up one!! I have since employed that same strategy when promoting this book to others....try it, at the library if you can't find a copy elsewhere.I must confess that, in hidsight, I did like the first two books...maybe three... the best, but still hung out for the rest of them to complete the series, and was not disappointed.The story has been made into a television movie, but in my opinion it was a very poor, lacklustre and rather off-putting portrayal of what could have been...in the right hands...akin to Peter Jackson's screen version of Lord of the Rings. Well, at least nowadays I believe it could be!It is a saga which spans generations and needs to reflect the consequences of time.I am eternally grateful to my friend for feeling motivated to share that book with me at that point in my life, and so grateful to the author for having inspired in me an abiding interest and passion for Herbs and Herbal Remedies which in turn led to an equally strong love for cooking and experimenting with all types of Herbs. It was then a natural progression into the wonderful world of Spices and, other Cultures.Resulting effects were that my senses of taste and smell had been introduced to brand new and exciting highs as I went on to discover a world of Herbs and Spices with their myriad qualities and applications. Everyday, I still enjoy the effects of those earlier influences.I noticed from the reviews that other people were also inspired in different and positive ways from reading this book.NEVER underestimate the power of a well written  and researched  book! Regardless of topic, genre or source...what do they say....""When the pupil is ready, the teacher appears"".Thank you Izzy.. you know who you are.. For introducing me to The Clan of the Cave Bear. [image error]Thank you Jean M.Auel, for not only giving us these stories, but for the absolute lengths that you went to in order to do so.It was sometimes a long wait between books, but this is because your research took you so far and wide in order to make the stories as authentic and credible as you possibly could. You do fine service to your work. They are all BIG books and offer very good value to your avid readers. I am richer for having enjoyed them...Namaste..[image error]"
1296,1621043997,it was ok,"Esperar ha sido mala idea. Esperar tanto tiempo para leerlo (bueno, en este caso fue audiolibro) y esperar tanto de una novela icónica en una época en la que se me iban los ojos con libros de todo tipo (es del 80 pero se puso de moda a finales de los 90, si no recuerdo mal). Si lo hubiera leído en su día lo habría disfrutado más. Sin embargo, a día de hoy, este libro es para mí un ""sí pero no"".Entre la ficción y el documental, gana este último. Eso hace que a veces resulte árido, dejando la trama en segundo plano como una excusa para centrarse en lo que realmente quiere: mostrar el mundo, la sociedad y la cultura de la tribu. No es exagerado, pero en ocasiones encuentras listados de objetos, de plantas, de animales... listados... En fin, que resulta muy interesante, tiene detalles geniales sobre el funcionamiento de su sociedad neandertal (como esa mente colmena capaz de recordar a través de generaciones) y la trama es correcta, pero en conjunto me resulta insatisfactorio como novela. Tal vez la monótona voz que locutaba el audiolibro ha tenido algo que ver, pero se me ha hecho bastante pesado. En el fondo, creo que le sobra bastante al libro. La historia en sí, desprovista de su maravilloso maquillaje, se queda en poca cosa. A veces me resultaba simplona su narrativa, que no sería un inconveniente de no ser por el contraste con la profesionalidad con la que detalla por otro lado esos aspectos documentales. Conclusión:-Me ha gustado la parte más documental y me ha aburrido la mayor parte de la trama. No me parece mala, sino reguleramente ejecutada para mi gusto. Es difícil lograr un buen equilibrio entre la asepsia científica y los sentimientos de los personajes. -Creo que le sobra ""metraje"". No porque sea muy largo, sino porque la historia en realidad no da tanto de sí. -Mi nota personal está entre 2 y 2,5 no porque sea una novela regular, sino porque no me ha terminado de gustar del todo. Es una puntuación basada en mi gusto. Si le pusiera nota en función de su calidad, le pondría un poco más.-Para ""wordbuilding"" en fantasía viene bien porque ves puntos que funcionan y otros que es mejor omitir. "
1296,1196941820,really liked it,"This book is the first in a series, to which I strongly suspect I am hooked. (How convenient I was looking for a new series to become engrossed it, being up to date with all my the series I’m currently reading). The series follows Ayla a bright, engaging girl who must fight to survive in a challenging and often hostile world. In this the first book she loses her family aged 5 in an earthquake and is taken in by another group, in this case Neanderthals. In many respects it is a story we have heard before. Human child loses family and is left unprotected only to be rescued by another group. Jungle Book for instance instantly springs to mind.I read a lot of historical fiction but I think it’s safe to say I have never read one set during the Stone Age. It is not a period I’m particularly familiar with. I remember covering it briefly in history as a child but it was quickly passed over in favour of the later periods of which we know more and of which there is more evidence in Ireland. My first thoughts when I began reading this was to wonder how accurate was it. We of course have some idea how people lived, what they ate and the tools they used. But to what degree can we now how they communicated or how their society was structured. I was amazed to discover that much within the book is fact in fact true, or at least was considered true when it was published over 30 years (some things have since been disproved through more recent discoveries). The degree of research is evident throughout. Detailed descriptions are often provided about how something was done. While this was interesting I do have a gripe with it. At times I felt these explanations became too technical and interfered with the flow of the story and I often found myself skimming over these sections. A notes section explaining may have been more beneficial and less disruptive to the story.This is my only real compliant however. Overall I really enjoyed it. Ayla is an engaging and likeable lead character. It may not be world class literature, but it certainly addictive and engrossing. Perfect escapism."
1296,7531238,liked it,"I've been wanting to read it for years, ever since I saw my father read it. So when an anthropology course got me interested in prehistoric humans, this seemed like the perfect choice to read. Now, having read it, I'm a little unsure what I think about it. On the one hand, I really liked the concept of the book, and I'm definitely planning to read the next one in the series, not because it ended on a cliffhanger, but also because I'm genuinely interested in just where the series is going. On the other hand, there were some aspects of Auel's writing that really bothered me. I think that the book would have really benefited from an editor to cut out some of the repetitive descriptive passages. I thought that her foreshadowing was really heavy handed as well. I'm not usually too observant about that kind of thing, but knowing whenever something was going to go wrong took some of the fun out of the book for me. There were also times when Ayla's character grated on my nerves. However, there were also times when I didn't want to put the book down at all. I guess my real rating of this is a 3.5: it's not quite a 4 because of the problems I mentioned above, but I did enjoy it a bit more than just a 3 indicates."
1296,2059802464,did not like it,"What a loathsome book.I wanted to put this down about 10% of the way through but I kept reading because an aquaintance told me this book was about angels, and time travel, and a war or something, so I kept reading because I thought something interesting was coming. Nope. Wrong book or something.This is a book about a human girl who is orphaned and taken in by some Neanderthals. She is raised as one of them, becomes a prodigy, and is generally accepted by everyone. Except the bad guy, who is just an angry man who is completely defined by his goulish hatred of the main character.It spends so much time repeating itself, which is tiresome. And it defeats its own ability to create suspension of disbelief by having no coherent POV: it switches between people, and also to a weird narrator voice that talks like a BBC show about people's frontol lobes or lack thereof, and dehydration, and the need for oxygen.I mean the content was also garbage. I didn't need to read pages and pages in which the main character deduced that babies don't come from a woman swallowing the essence of a man's spirit animal and having her spirit animal subdued: they come from a ""man's organ"". **Gasp**. What utter bilge. I do not understand why this is a 4 star book."
1296,1351259251,it was amazing,"Je zult maar als eenling tussen een andere stam terecht komen. In de prehistorische wildernis van het Europa van 35.000 jaar geleden vindt de Stam van de Holebeer een klein meisje. Ze is moederziel alleen; haar familie is bij een aardbeving om het leven gekomen en ook zelf is ze gewond. Hoewel het kind niet tot het volk van de Stam behoort, neemt Iza, de medicijnvrouw haar op. Ze krijgt de naam Ayla.Haar pleegmoeder is de heelmeester(es) van de clan en deze leert Ayla de heelkundige kennis die ze heeft. Ayla is een leerlinge die graag leert. Al begrijpt ze niet altijd wat wel en niet mag binnen de clan. Iets dat haar vaak duur komt te staan.De hoofdpersonen zijn zo goed uitgewerkt dat je het hele verhaal als een film aan je voorbij ziet gaan. De gebruiken en de omgeving en de gebeurtenissen van de stam worden prachtig verteld. Ook de manier waarop tijd verstrijkt (een stuk langzamer als nu) is mooi omschreven. Ik raad dit boek van harte aan. Het is een boek uit een serie. Ik raad wel aan ook de volgorde aan te houden van de boeken. Dit omdat er dan een geschiedenis tijdlijn in zit en de ontwikkeling van sommige hoofdpersonages dan beter te volgen is."
1296,1659488971,it was amazing,"This book and its' sequel are beautiful, original and evocative novels that document the coming of age story of a young girl in the neolithic period. This book is something of a classic in historical fiction and for good reason. The exploration of kin, family, sex, gender roles, biology, identity and spirituality result in novels that are rich and complex. However, my favourite aspects of the first two books in the season was the intensely evoked loneliness I felt for the MC. I read much of this book and the next with a lump in my throat. Her confusion, her isolation and her constant attempts (and inevitable failure) to appease her adoptive family is painfully relatable. There are certain elements that are a little dated, however by and large this story is unique and strongly realised. Anyone even remotely interested in historical fiction, evolution, hunter-gather cultures, books about family, books about culture, or coming of age stories should give this one a go. It made me cry quite a few times which has only happened with one other book in the last four years. "
1296,122786355,it was amazing,"this is one of my favorite series out there. The first book here is in my opinion the best book out of the series as well. You can easily just read this one and have a fantastic story without having to continue on with the others. Ayla is such a memorable character. She is bold, and kind hearted. She is thirsting for knowledge and longing for the feeling that she belongs somewhere. She desires friendship, siblings and caretakers and gets a little bit of each of these things through different members of the clan, but most of all she makes an enemy. Just for existing. It made me laugh and cry and I recommend this series every chance that I get. This first book is somewhat basic, there is a little tiny bit of sex, but not too detailed, as the series progresses and she becomes older those will become more mature in nature."
1296,1900434862,it was amazing,"Oh. My. Gosh. This book blew my mind. I saw the movie years ago and remember enjoying it but somehow I never read the book. It's incredible, so atmospheric and vivid, Auel paints the life of the clan so vividly I could picture the cave and the food and the clan. I love Ayla, she is such a brilliant, strong, dynamic character. It was wonderful reading about the differences between the Clan and the Others, imaging the changes that took place at this time in history. I loved the pacing, that this story wasn't rushed but also doesn't drag, and that there is just enough development and conflict to never feel bored but not so much where it feels overly burdened. The story tells itself, it feels natural and the characters feel genuine. I can't wait to reads the 2nd book in the series!"

I've never read anything with such depth in so many ways. History, anthropology, biology religion, the human spirit, and more. I think I had something to say to my wife about almost every page and I was constantly thinking and comparing the people of the Clan's time to our own. We're not really all that different though we'd like to pretend we are. The same themes appear in their lives with different content. Ayla is, by far, the strongest character I've had the fortune of reading about. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"

1296,483469560,it was amazing,"It is one of my favorite books. It is an arduous read and requires true dedication. Ayla is a literary hero who triumphs through her obstacles with spirit and intelligence. The descriptions of the book can be a bit difficult, but I did love Ayla's story."
1296,2363917682,really liked it,"4/5 Perhaps I'm too fresh off of closing this book, but as of now I'm absolutely delighted. The issues I had at the start with the pacing made me wary at first, but they completely disappeared after page 100-ish and I had so much difficulty putting the book down. Most of my problems with the story ended when the pacing troubles did, starting with...CHARACTERS. Our protagonist, a Cro Magnon girl named Ayla, is only five years old when the Neandrathal clan adopts her. Her acquiescence to authority figures (read: everyone, but especially the males of the clan) is at odds with her inquisitive, defiant nature at the start, to the point where it feels like Auel is showing you one Ayla and telling you of another. However, once she (view spoiler)[ begins to hunt  (hide spoiler)] she becomes far more self-assured and becomes a delight to read. The novel closes with Ayla around age 13-14 ish, and she is oddly mature for that age then, but it stands to reason given that (1) she's officially a woman by age 10 for the clan and (2) (view spoiler)[ her several near death experiences, Broud's abuse, rape, losing all her loved ones in quick succession, etc. (hide spoiler)]The other characters, especially Iza, Creb, Brun, and Broud, are very interesting to read from. I buddy read this novel with a friend and both of us were struck with how little we knew about cavemen. Auel's author's note says she spent years researching humanity's prehistoric ancestors, so for the purposes of this story I will accept her assertions about the differences in neandrathal and Cro Magnon thought as fact. PLOT.As I mentioned, the plot took a while to build up, but when it got going, BOY did it go fast. The consistent escalation of risk and the scope of the potential consequences kept me on the edge of my seat, and I was never really not afraid for Ayla. Auel's Prehistoric Europe was equal parts beautiful and dangerous, so I felt a consistent sense of fear for all the character's lives. As Ayla matured and overcame greater and greater obstacles, I started to fear for her less, but when (view spoiler)[ her allies began to die off (hide spoiler)] that fear came back tenfold. Even with that escalation, no plot point felt unnecessary. The Clan ascribe to totems/spiritual protectors what I call ""character development."" It was a little on the nose when Ayla (view spoiler)[ would come back stronger after a challenge/risk/death curse and thank her Cave Lion totem (hide spoiler)], but I DID feel that each episode of that was necessary to her growth as a character and the culmination of the plot as a whole. One small complaint I have is that the story felt oddly incomplete. The ending wrapped up a CHAPTER of Ayla's story, but when I reached it I felt as though I was missing a few pages wherein the story would REALLY come to a close. I know that CotCB is part of a 6 book series, but I prefer for the first book of a series at least to be able to stand alone if it must. I DID enjoy seeing all the various plot points wrap up by the end (e.g.; (view spoiler)[deformed children, how a cro/neandrathal baby happens, Ayla seeing the men's ceremonies, Ayla FINALLY getting for-real death cursed, Broud losing to her for good...... (hide spoiler)])SETTING (and Writing Style).As I mentioned earlier, Auel's prehistoric Europe is meticulously researched. I'm a big fan of rich, extensive worldbuilding in all of my fiction, and I've never seen it quite this thorough except in high fantasy or heavy sci fi. In addition to being oddly idyllic in one sense, the cave and its surroundings never felt safe or secure the way a modern home does. The wildness of the setting lent the story a sense of urgency even in ""safe/dull"" moments (e.g.; when the Clan was snowed in for the winter). Auel's descriptions of the landscape and some of the actions were jarring at first. It's as though she has an encyclopedic knowledge of, say, shaping caveman tools, and feels she HAS to include it or else all the research is for naught. The paragraphs long listing of the animals, both edible and not, near the cave also made little sense where it was, for similar reasons (what does this add to the plot?). But after a while, even the unnecessary feeling descriptions began to grow on me. Things I Could Have Done Without/With Less Of: - Ayla being called ugly all the time. We get it. After the first three or four repetitions it becomes old. ESPECIALLY when we get a description of her later and she looks basically like Brooke Shields in Blue Lagoon. Yeah... so ugly... (also the description of her mature/adult female body happens when she's 10/11.)- Repetition in general, actually. Broud being ""the son of Brun's heart"" is understandable after the first mention, for example. For all that the Clan are supposed to have infallible memories, they sure do like to repeat themselves. Also, there were a few instances of unnecessary clarification, where Auel would ""show"" something in the narrative, and then in the next sentence ""tell""/explain it as though it hadn't JUST HAPPENED. - ...I was going to say the misogyny but honestly? I think it's addressed and fought against pretty effectively, especially considering the time period and the people involved. TW for rape/assault for sure, though - I would have liked a more distinct voice for Ayla, but that's nitpicky considering Auel's style."

1296,2167447484,really liked it,I loved it. 
1296,2013365847,really liked it,"It's a kind of stiff and formal read, but the story is excellent and imaginatively written. Set in a time period of about 25,000 years ago, it concerns a young female orphan, obviously from a Cro-Magnon family, who is taken in by a clan of Neanderthals. The girl, Ayla, grows into a woman, and is taught by the clan how to survive and fit into their tight and complex society. Weaving, cooking, caring for babies and children, gathering edible plants, making leather and fur into clothing, etc. - these are all the approved and expected activities for normal female Neanderthals. Their society is strictly patriarchal and divided into rough family units made up of a man and his mate and any children the mate has.There is one exception to this male-dominated society, lineage is determined by one's mother. The children of a man's mate is referred to just that way: the children of his mate. This is because the Neanderthals are really on the wrong page when it comes to how children are conceived. It involves totems and the spirit world, and it's hard to explain. It was one part of the book I just didn't 'get.' (Hence, the father of any child could be any mature man in the clan, except for a woman's male siblings. They're very particular about that.)However, it's a well-researched book as regards the plants and animals of the time, the topography, and the way the lives of these people might have been. However, our little orphan girl doesn't fit in that well; she's different. She's blond and tall; she's also 'ugly' - no brow ridges! and such a flat face! But she can also do things the other women can't. For one, she's smart and curious, traits not compatible with proper female Neanderthal behavior. Eventually she becomes at odds with one of the male members of the clan who feels...Well, into spoiler territory here. It's an excellent book, if a bit verbose. This can't be an easy topic to write about, seeing how a lot of what we 'know' is based on so little evidence. But what we do know Ms. Auel handles quite well, expertly in fact. I intend to read the next book in this series.Four stars."
1296,2017497363,really liked it,"I've heard people talk about Jean Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear for eons and have resisted reading it, as historical fiction about Neandertals and Cro Magnon groups sounds, erm, fictional and silly. Probably much of Cave Bear is not historically accurate; on the other hand, it provides an interesting window into a different world, whether or not it is accurate. With this in mind, Cave Bear has the ability to be as useful – as defined as increasing my understanding of different perspectives – as any book written by any member of a marginalized group. This was an interesting and unexpected conclusion.Keep in mind that Ayla, a Cro Magnon child adopted by a Neandertal tribe following an earthquake killing her family, was played by Daryl Hannah in the 1986 movie of the same name. From the perspective of most people of my age (at least), Daryl Hannah is lovely; nonetheless, her looks and behavior are seen as strange and wrong: Standing up at her full height, the girl was even taller than Izathought. Her legs were long, spindly with knobby knees, and straight. Iza wondered if they were deformed. The legs of Clan people were bowed in an outward curvature, but, except for a limp, the child had no problem moving around. Straight legs must be normal for her too, Iza decided— like [her] blue eyes. (p. 43).  Similarly, Ayla's assertiveness, independence, style of thinking, and smiling were all seen as different and, often, bad, just as were her flagrant violations of gender norms. The chief's son, for example, was jealous and resentful of Ayla's greater successes in many realms, and beat or raped her as a result. Rape and assault here and elsewhere is about power and degradation.In sum, Auel offers an interesting view of one possible world, a view that helps us understand our own more fully. Cave Bear was a very pleasant surprise."

I peeked inside and was surprised to see that there were no pictures and the words were so small. I couldn't ever imagine being old enough to read a book like this. About 5 years ago, I was surprised to see this book on a few people's ""Best books I ever read"" lists. I remembered the book from my childhood and decided that I was probably old enough to read it now. ;) Wow, this book was really good! It was very different than anything I have read. The story, set in pre-historic times, is about a young girl who loses her family during an earthquake and is left to fend for herself. She is on death's doorstep when she is rescued/adopted by another clan of people who look very different than she does. This book tells her story. This book started out a little bit slow for me, but really picked up after a few chapters. It got to the point that I had a hard time putting it down. Then it lost a little steam during parts of the Clan Gathering. It picked back up in the end, until it ended with a cliffhanger- I was NOT expecting that, but came to the realization that it was coming when I saw the number of pages remaining was dwindling and things were no where near wrapped up! I knew this was book #1 in a series, but didn't expect that it would leave me hanging in the end. Despite the ending, I enjoyed this book and it will stay with me for a long time. I will have to do some research into the rest of the series and decide if I am going to continue. "
1296,2341164035,it was amazing,"Tengo que decir que todo me gustó: el argumento, los personajes, la ambientación, la manera de contarlo. Todo. No es perfecto, ni mucho menos, le encuentro algunas cosillas, pero sin ellas, la historia no sería la misma.El libro es bastante fiel a la realidad de la época. Tanto, que muchas cosas que le pasan a nuestra protagonista tienen un toque de cruda realidad en cuanto a ser mujer se refiere. Sí, hay escenas malas. Escenas que tienes que decidir si saltártelas, y perder ese pedacito del rompecabezas que forma toda la historia, o apechugar y vivir con Ayla tanto los momentos buenos, como los malos.También hay muchos personajes y es algo que por una parte me gusta, porque hay muchos diálogos a lo largo de la historia. No es el típico libro que durante un capítulo se pasan describiendo el paisaje. No, hay interacción, acción, información, detalles… También hay descripciones, pero no largas y pesadas.No os quiero crear muchas expectativas y que después no se cumplan, pero si estáis pensando si leerlo o no, os digo que merece totalmente la pena.Reseña completa: https://armasdetinta.wordpress.com/20..."
1296,1929575169,liked it,"This book has been on my 'to read' radar for at least 20 years so I was glad to finally get to it.Mixed feelings about this overall. With a story line set in the time of early man there is really no way that some of the writing cannot come off as anachronistic. But, I found a few cases where glaring references could have been avoided. For example, describing a shard of flint as being 'as sharp as broken glass' just seemed out of place. The author seems to have done her research and is a good storyteller. A couple of things were a little predictable, but those fit in with the natural flow of the story.This is a 3.5 star book. I enjoyed it and will read the others at some point but don't feel the urgency to rush out at read them right now. (TBH I never feel like that as I hate binge reading.)"
1296,2631706723,liked it,"This is the book I read for book club at school and it was a student pick! I love when students pick books that I probably never would have read without their recommendations and picks!The book takes place during the Ice Age? The Neolithic Age? I was a little unsure which one, but it takes place way back when people were living in caves. Ayla gets lost from her mother and ends up with a different clan, The Clan of the Cave Bear. The clans people didn’t want to accept her because she’s so different, but the medicine woman takes her in and raises her as her daughter. I liked the theme of acceptance and other that carried throughout the book. I also liked how strong the main character was, and how she didn’t want to accept the gender norms put in place by the clan. She wants to hunt, but knows that she cannot because she’s a woman. It made me think about how thousands of years later women are still fighting for equality! If you’re looking for an interesting book that takes place back during the time of Mammoths, then definitely check it out! It was a little long, and hard to follow some of the characters because the names were so different, but overall an enjoyable book! "

1296,1464131654,it was amazing,Too many thoughts - review to follow 
1296,667142467,did not like it,"The only things that are accurate in this book are contained in the endless infodumps. The facts may be well-researched, but the ideas Auel is pushing are both unscientific and obnoxious.First and foremost, her take on evolution should be kept away from our young, who don't know any better and would believe that evolution has a purpose, from which it is but a step to intelligent design. Phrases like ""nature's experiment"", ""in an effort to postpone extinction nature tried..."", and even ""destiny"" creep up all the time. Look, no one knows for certain what caused Neanderthal extinction, but it was most probably a combination of external and quite random factors. Like being forced through a bottleneck by disease and then being hit by a climate change - just an example, and could have happened to us just as easily; could even happen still, actually.I was going to cite the whole ""genetic memory"" as a second example, but on reflection it really doesn't need my pointing out that this is where we get firmly into the realm of fantasy, leaving speculative fiction far behind.But even considered as a work of literature, this would be noticeably below standard. The writing is unnecessarily repetitively redundant, and leafing through the thesaurus at every opportunity doesn't make it any better. The tone and atmosphere don't exist. Whenever a feeble attempt is made by either, up pops an infodump or a disruptively modern, scientific-sounding term. And every single inference is spelled out for us stupid Cromagnons - wait, we are innovative and brilliant Cromagnons, not hidebound in tradition at all, never, never...And don't let me forget the whole ""white supremacy"" message. I'll allow that Ayla's being blue-eyed blonde while everyone else is relatively swarthy may be just the author's working out a kink, to make her ""ugly"" when we know she's in fact beautiful, and not real true racism. But as far as I'm concerned she could be bright green and still have offensively ""white"" connotations. Do you guys really enjoy reading about someone who is best at everything, and I mean everything, exclusively by the right of her birth? Mastering all the Neanderthal skills of both sexes while still a kid, inventing new things, not losing anything in the emotional side of her life with all that intellect, even being the only one who sensed the earthquake! What's the challenge then? What could make an effective plot with a protagonist like that and an antagonist like a small bit of carefully blacked tough-cured hide? Ayla always wins and is always best, I'm sure the slowest reader would have grasped that after about five repetitions, and we get scores.This is the kind of book some people recommend to young readers, thinking that the repetitions and the spelling-out are intended for them. In fact both are bad for them, disabling them as interested and active readers and conditioning them to like bad literature in general. Too bad there's so little fiction in prehistoric setting - this wouldn't have been nearly so popular else.***Update: I had a look at the reviews for further books in this series and found out that there is no mention of the fate of Broud's clan. What? At the end of the book, their position is almost as critical as Ayla's. What would they do next? While the clan consists of not very well-developed, frequently interchangeable characters, I was disappointed to find that even the author herself cares nothing for what would become of them. Only the blue-eyed girl matters, that's right. This would make me rate this book further down if that were possible."
1296,2332537611,really liked it,"I hate Broud, with everything inside me, I hate Broud and I hope his character dies a thousand deaths in the sequel. (I hate Broud!!) "
1296,51441507,it was ok,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I'm tempted to read the next book in the series to find out what happens next (although I probably won't). But on the other hand, I'm deeply disturbed by some of the subject matters of the book. An author who writes about pre-history has a definite choice about how to create her characters and what they do because there are no written records to tell us how they behaved. The subject matter of the story is interesting enough. A young girl whose clan was killed in an earthquake is rescued by a The Clan of the Cave Bear whose physical traits are very different from her own. The Clan of the Cave Bear has great difficulty in accepting the girl, Ayla, because she is very different from them. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, isn't as short and stout as they are, uses more language than them, laughs and cries, and doesn't have the collective memories that they have. While eventually accepted by most, she's constantly loathed by Broud who is slated to become the next leader of the clan. He constantly showers her with hate and violence, despises her upcoming status as medicine woman, hates the luck that follows her, and wishes death upon her.The author has obviously done much research in order to show the medicinal qualities of the plants of the region and the weapons used by the people of the time. However, sometimes the book reads more like an encyclopedia when the author chooses to emphasize some of these things. I like the attention to detail, but it seems extremely awkward in places. It also disturbs me that this author chose to emphasize infanticide and the physical and sexual violence of cave men toward their women. The clan seems to take infanticide and abuse as normal. What really made me angry was that the author seemed to try to write the violent scenes in an erotic way that I've only ever seen in this series and the Outlander series. It disturbs me that, in both series, rape is commonplace, accepted, and eroticized. What's even more disturbing is that nobody seems to mention them in their reviews of the book. Someone said to me that these violent acts are placed in the book to show the people moving away from violence. However, I didn't see any evidence of anyone reacting negatively toward the violence except for Ayla. I had difficulty determining if the author was writing from a feminist perspective that assumed all men to be sex-crazed and violent or if the author was glorifying these things. I'm not sure how to rate this book because I hated some components of it, but I want to find out what happens in the next book as Ayla searches for people of her own kind. So I'll rate it thusly:*Cliffhanger ending = 4 stars*Unnecessary violence toward women = 1 star*Research = 5 stars*Awkward use of research = 1 stars*Story idea = 4 stars*Fantasy elements = 1 starAVERAGE = 2.6 stars, rounded DOWN to 2 stars Eh."
1296,2010434890,liked it,"I read this book when I was a teenager but don't remember much about it except for ""assume the position."" I am not sure exactly why I decided to read it again after so many years but I think it is probably because it is so much of a classic that I wondered what it was really about. If the goal of an author is achieved in writing a Siri's when she gets you to read the second book, this first book seems to have been a success for me.I don't remember much from the one anthropology class I took in college. I think I got a C. But the experience of looking back to the Neanderthal days I found quite interesting. And the mixing of the two generations of humanoids I found fascinating. Having them meet indirectly and having them walk a mile in the others shoes was an interesting thought piece.The book begins with an earthquake and ends with an earthquake. And our Advanced heroine Who wandered into the land of the cave people as a naked five-year-old was cast out as a teenager to seek out her own people having already born a child and become an honored medicine woman. A short and crowded lifespan played havoc with our three score and 10 so I guess the evangelicals of the world must think very little of this series. To have the lead character not only be a woman but an incipient feminist definitely scores some points. She gets a fair amount of criticism from other readers for being at the cutting edge of so many advances in human evolution. I am willing to cut her a good deal of slack since this is a relatively short time frame. Although a series of six books is relatively long it is nothing compared to the length of time these changes presumably actually occurred. The idea that the Neanderthal brain contained significant stores of memory practically at birth made me wonder what divides scientific fact from fiction in this book.I listen to this book in the audible for Matt and also but the second book in audible. According to the book the cave people had relatively few spoken words and much of their communication was by sign. It was hard to convey this effectively in the book of course since the book is all about words. But overall I enjoyed reading the book. I am simultaneously listening to The Brothers Karamazov so you can see how something comparatively simple might be welcome!"
1296,160442998,liked it,"Anthropology has always interested me. In college, I earned a degree in Anthropological Sciences, studying subjects like paleoanthropology, archaeology, primatology as well as as hunting-gathering societies and human culture. It was this interest that led me to the Earth's Children series, when I recently glimpsed ""The Land of Painted Caves"" (book 6) in a new releases newsletter. Intrigued, I decided to pick up book 1, The Clan of the Cave Bear.I'd never read a historical fiction like this, featuring Neanderthals and prehistoric anatomically modern humans as the main characters. That already earns this novel a full star in my book, since I've seen nothing else that tackles this time period. The first thing I noticed was that this book was very carefully researched. There were some inaccuracies, most notably anatomical ones, but I also remind myself that this book was written in 1980. As well, Auel takes many artistic liberties with Neanderthal social behaviors, especially with those relating to gender roles. But on the whole, the facts were well done. While much of the paleoanthropological facts in the book are mostly of a general nature, reading it did bring back some fond memories of school, like the time I got to learn to knap my own flint tools (it's harder than you would expect, by the way).But that's as far as my enjoyment of the book went, I'm afraid. I think I understand what the author was trying to do, showing the straightforward way prehistoric hominins might have communicated or conveyed their thoughts, but after a while the repetition and the internal dialogue really grated me. I also felt the story was good, but it was told in a long, drawn out manner, using mostly descriptions of the characters' every-day life and relationships. Ironically, at times it felt like I was reading an ethnography instead of a novel."
1296,1398714291,it was amazing,"I've read this book a long, long time ago, I was 11 year-old when the book was published. I still remember clearly some passages and - lo and behold - I have the book yet. Ayla was the first bad-ass heroine I came upon, and I loved her. She was caught in between times/places where/when Cro-Magnon interacted with Neanderthals. Is this historically correct? I have no idea. And really, I didn't care at that time.There are things that are meant to be experienced just once. I remember a time when I was a kid and I did a ballet presentation. The theatre seemed huge and with a swarm of spectators. I was impressed - with everything and with myself - and a bit scared.When I took my daughter to dance in the same theatre, years later, I had a total different experience - of course! - but what stroke me more was, Is this the enormous, bright place that made me fell so important and yet so small?Yes, it was. Although it was a very, very happy moment for me as a mother and it was great to have had that experience so I could share it with my daughter, I have to confess, for my inner child it was a disappointment. I still wanted to think I had been in that immense theatre, an important ballet dancer, who didn't miss a step and received a round of applause. But I digress.The Clan of the Cave Bear is not a book on paleontology; it is not a historical book. But I loved it. The five star rating is based in my impressions from decades ago and I wouldn't be able to do an accurate review of it today. Yet, I won't spoil the fun I had at that time, re-reading it with my older eyes so I could review it better. I'll keep treasuring it.If I hadn't read it before, were looking for a nice, uncompromising reading, and had time, I would give it a try again."
1296,865696671,it was amazing,"Such a joy to revisit a beloved book from my teenage years. I must have read it a few times in quick succession back then, but had not read it for a good fifteen years.It is easy to get lost in Ayla’s world. She, a girl of the Others, survived an earthquake and was found my a group of Neanderthals and is adopted by them. She grows up as she struggles to adher to their Clan ways.This is such an interesting unique book. The author clearly has done thorough research into prehistoric humans and she painstakingly explains many of the methods those people may have used in their daily lives to make tools, find food or treat hides. On occasion this distracts from the story, but most of the times it enriches the image of Ayla’s world.To share Ayla’s story is to feel like you are walking a path your own ancestors may have walked tens of thousands of years ago. She lives in a changing world, where one era is ending and another beginning. You cannot help but feel Ayla’s frustration as she attempts to adjust to living amongst a people so different from the ones she was born to.Of course it is the author’s imagination that depicts the Neanderthals as a people reliant on traditions and history, but who is to say that they were not? The way she portrays them is believable and you feel a real warmth towards them and a sadness to know their story has long ended.The last 30 pages are heart wrenching and I am not too proud to admit I cried like a baby. This book holds a special place in my heart."
1296,1036605552,liked it,"The deeper I got into this, the more I realized how much it sounded like a fairy tale/Disney movie in several ways:  orphaned by tragic circumstances taken in death of a loved one evil leader/villian prone to evil doings when he doesn’t get his way oppression of the little guy death curses super superstitious super jealous spirit guides, like fairy godmothers, who grant wishesSo you see, it does read like a fairy tale in a way, but not one you’d read to your little innocent darlings by the light of the moon. Mainly because it also had: young girl with poor body image repeated rape violence toward women free sex cannibalismOkay, okay, some of that too is found in darker fairy tales. I'm sure I could add to this list, but nothing else is coming to mind.There were also a couple of scenes that stabbed at my memory of an old Mel Brooks movie I saw way back when. So I had that playing in the background of my mind, and because of that, it was a little hard to take this seriously. What I did find interesting was the science of this. I am sure this book took an incredible amount of research and knowledge. I appreciated the feeling of having learned something I didn’t know before; that is one of the many reasons I love historical fiction. But I didn’t love this."
1296,153845236,really liked it,"Maybe it's because I love learning about the prehistoric people from which we came. Maybe it's because I love stories about strong women who survive almost unbeatable odds to become even stronger. Or perhaps it's because there's something about the daily doings of people, doings with which I can relate, where mothers love their children, fathers protect their families, elders teach the young. These are the ordinary doings of living that have breached the bigness of time from 25,000 years ago to the present and continue today to provide a peaceful place for us. I really don't have much desire to figure out why I loved this book, but I did.Others might look down on The Clan of the Cave Bear. It's not a classic, in the truest sense of the word. Sometimes Auel gets a bit flowery with her words. This is why I didn't give it a five star rating. Yet, the story drew me in and drew me back, day after day, to where I intentionally slowed my reading to make it last longer, even tho I was aware that there are five additional sequels. I'm already dreading the time when I've finished all six books and have to let Ayla go.I've sorely missed having this kind of book, the kind that ENTRANCES. For me, this is precisely what feeds my love for reading."
1296,1793478625,it was amazing,"I absolutely loved this book. Due to it's setting, it was extremely unique and refreshing, and I found most of the characters realistic enough to be drawn to them (with the exception of Broud, who was a little over the top in his childlessness). The book itself reminded me strongly of Outlander in that it was set in a place I was rather unfamiliar with, and also in the perhaps overzealous account of plants and their medical uses- which I personally found fascinating. Though much research was put into this book, it is clear that Auel took liberties in the construction of her Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal depictions, which I was more than willing to overlook considering that this was a.) published in 1980, and b.) a historical fiction. Besides that, that the whole story was fascinating to me. I was completed compelled by this Ice Age world, and Auel definitely earns a token of respect from me for even tackling this time period. Definitely reading the next in the series, and soon."
1296,90058335,it was amazing,"My mother was an avid reader and a stunted fan of archaeology. She took me to the King Tut exhibit in the 1970s, and she owned this book. I first read it in high school and I credit this book and our trips to the Field Museum in Chicago as the inspiration for my BA in anthropology and religious studies, and my many years working in museums.As an anthropologist by training, what really fascinates me is the idea of being dropped into an entirely alien culture or environment, and how do we as humans adapt and survive. This book shows how Ayla is dropped into a world as absolutely alien to her as to modern people. We see this world and learn about it through her eyes. We get to see how she learns to adapt, how she suppresses her natural self in order to be accepted and even loved. We get to learn how these people live along with Ayla.I periodically reread the entire series and I never get tired of it."

Wat een tijdperk om als vrouw in op te groeien en te leven. Die constante onderdanigheid die ze moeten houden jegens die mannen, het zou niet aan mij besteed zijn. Aan het personage van Broud heb ik me zo vaak geërgerd dat ik werkelijk het gevoel kreeg om hem er eentje tegen zijn oren te draaien. Geweldig als een boek me zo in verschillende emoties kan brengen.

1296,290516399,it was amazing,"This is one of those books that sucks you in from the start. I enjoyed feeling a part of the time that the story is told in, and learning about how things were done. I did not notice the typographical errors that some other reviewers have commented on. The story really does take you to a different time, allowing you to feel like you are there. I could smell the smell the woolly mammoth on the big hunt, and felt the shock of the other clan members when Ayla took out the sling and saved the little one's life. I could feel the isolation when she was sent away, and shed a tear at her sadness when her family was gone. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to be transported in their reading and wants to feel a part of what they are reading."
1296,56052144,liked it,"I really have mixed feelings about this book! Parts of it I liked...and I liked a lot of the characters. However....the author could have made this a shorter book...she's very repetitive! I felt like the Clan acted like cave people some of the times...gestures and thoughts on sex and childbirth were very fitting, but the conversations and many thoughts were very ""today"" and it made the book awkward for me. I listened to it and the narrator was sometimes annoying when things were said over and over. I think I enjoyed learning about all the uses of plants and animals for medicinal and healing purposes the most. I think I'll wait awhile and maybe try the second book in the series and see if I like that story better!"
1296,11023836,it was amazing,"I read and could see and understand, the world of people more than 35,000 years ago; civilization is such a thin veneer. I couldn't put the book down because the Author brought this world to life for me. Take away everything we rely on and fail to appreciate and you will still find the same heart of what we are, good and bad.Five year old Ayla is left ""really"" alone when her parents are crushed to death when their cave collapses during an earthquake. Another clan of humans happens upon the injured little girl who is close to death almost a week later; what would you do? Forget about race-- what would you do if she was another species? "

1296,2032460,it was amazing,"I got the unabridged version of this book out of the library on tape to listen to while I was painting several rooms in my house one summer. I loved it. I thought it was a unique look at the author's idea of what life could have been like for neanderthal and cro-magnon man. Jean Auel obviously did a lot of reasearch for this book and it comes out in her descriptions of flora and fauna and what certain herbs were used for and how things might have been cooked, etc. A truly fascinating story about a cro-magnon orphan girl raised by neanderthals, and the hardships she endured for being different. I have read it several times, and enjoy it every time."
1296,107381591,really liked it,"...The combination of meticulous research and an emotionally powerful story has made this novel into something specially. Although I have read the other books in the series and enjoyed them, I don't think any of these books quite manage this same mix. I can't honestly recommend the other books in the series but The Clan of the Cave Bear is an unusual novel. Not without it's flaws perhaps, but still something of a landmark. One of those books one ought to have read. It works fine as a standalone so even if the others do not interest you, give this one a try.Full Random Comments review"
1296,52285567,it was amazing,"I first read this series when I was about 10 and I have been wanting to read it again for some time. It was one of those books that made a great impression upon my young mind and I was curious to see how it read as an adult. Surprisingly I also really enjoyed it the second time around. I have been disappointed in the past with re-reads of my childhood faves but this time the book has stood the test of time. The author has a gift in describing the natural world that I particularly enjoy. The characters are well constructed and I guess I have always had a soft spot for an independent strong woman main character such as Ayla. Five stars for an engaging, pleasurable trip down memory lane."
1296,2248273353,it was amazing,"This book is one of my all time favorite books. Jean Auel's Earth's Children almost drove me insane - there was something akin to 8 years wait between each book. This, the first one, was my favorite. The fact that I read this eons ago and still remember the characters as if I just read it yesterday is because it touched me that deeply. Ayla, Jondalar, Broud, Brun...all live at the dawn of civilization. Their day-to-day lives interested me to no end. Auel put incredible thought and research into what our long ago ancestors did to survive. It is a book I highly recommend."
1296,8170029,it was amazing,"I read this series in high school. It was one of my mom's favorites and I just picked Clan of the Cave Bear off her pile one day and never looked back. There is no other series of books that I've read that could compare to these. You fall right into the prehistoric era, and you truly feel like you are there. Since I was reading this in junior high and high school, the sex scenes were also a plus. I'm sure if I re-read these books now I'd find the sexual parts a little to over the top for me. I've stated before that I like to leave some things to the imagination. "
1296,57334400,did not like it,"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1296,80245940,it was amazing,"I loved this book. It took me over a month to read because I was so engrossed in every single word. I loved the story, I loved the characters and I definitely love that it's a series. I can't wait to see the movie even though I have heard it is not so spectacular. It was nearly perfect but it took me a long time to begin to comprehend who the names were referring to, which was slightly distracting."
1296,602308663,it was amazing,"I first read this when I was about 12 years old, and loved it then. I re-read it just now, 25 years after my initial reading of it, and loved it just as much. A book that stands the test of time. Based on our ancient ancestors, and a strong woman who helped our race succeed"
1296,1126868714,really liked it,Unlike any other book I've read. I really enjoyed reading about The Clan but could have done with less descriptions of plants/climate etc. overall a great read and I'm looking forward to reading the next one to find out how the story continues.
1296,1895833953,,"My longstanding rule is to file a (non-erotica) book under ""quit reading"" should it contain both the phrases ""heaving alabaster bosom"" AND ""mound of pleasure"". One or the other, ok; both puts it in the trash. And ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" went into the trash."
1296,1242977304,really liked it,"Upon reflection, I think this book relied entirely on a great premise. I'm not so sure about the plot, and a lot of the writing was pretty heavy handed. But what an interesting way to think about the origins of modern humans."
1296,415760827,it was amazing,loved the whole series!!!!
1296,1467136426,liked it,"A four-star read when I read it, a couple of decades ago. I did like it enough to try to keep going in the series, but really, the part I actually liked, was the first part of this first book...."

1296,1279980609,it was amazing,"I'd say 4.5/5, but I gave it 5 because we can't do 1/2 stars.I can't believe I took so long to discover and read this book. I vaaaguely remember buying it almost twenty years ago when I was in college and halfheartedly trying it, but it did not grab my interest at that time.I recently picked up a battered copy from the '80s at a thrift store near me for $.19 when they had a sale, along with several vintage romances and scifi. When I posted the haul to my Facebook, the consensus was that I start with Clan of the Cave Bear. I listened to the hivemind, and I'm glad I did! This isn't necessarily a traditional review, so much as a running commentary of all the thoughts I had while reading it. It does include spoilers, so fair warning if you are interested enough to read on.**********The writing style kind of felt like reading a textbook that was engaging and interesting instead of dry and boring, which sounds weird to say, but for me it totally worked and felt natural.The book wastes no time in getting to the point. By the second page, Ayla is already an orphan. I was like O_o.I know the author did a lot of research, and that shows in the loving detail she incorporates. Not gonna lie... At times, it was a little tedious where descriptions of wildlife and the changing seasons were concerned, but I just skipped those paragraphs if I got tired of it. I did enjoy immensely the long descriptions of herbalism and medicines, as I found that very relevant to my own interests. Though she did tons of research, I am sure it is not entirely historically accurate, but I don't know a historical fiction novel that is. To me, a book like this needs a little creative license, particularly since I view our understanding of early humans as an inaccurate and interpretive science, anyway. Whatever stretches there might have been were worked in pretty seamlessly with no glaring oddities (at least for my limited knowledge of this topic).Based on the subject matter, I knew there would be rape in this book and I was a little worried since usually I avoid media that involves it. However, I must say that it was nothing like when we are exposed to rape today in the media, particularly in movies or TV. The scenes involving or discussing it were violent, but not as bad as I had feared. I think because, for once, it was rape that seemed to make sense, given the context in which they were living and the circumstances that led up to it. That sounds horrible, like I'm condoning it, but that is not what I mean. I just mean that the textbook, matter-of-fact writing style of this book coupled with the fact that the rapes did not seem gratuitous turned the descriptions about them almost into neutral pieces of data that were simply being documented, rather than unbearable acts of violation that kept happening over and over for no reason other than to be violent and dramatic. I am probably not explaining myself very well here, but oh well. I wanted to address it, particularly since it may be a trigger for some people.Reading this book was exciting for me because it is the first time in recent memory that I really had no idea what was going to happen and I really felt that ANYthing could happen to anyone. It is hard to explain. It was both predictable and suspenseful at the same time somehow. I knew vaguely what would happen (I knew Iza would die in this book or that Broud would end up raping Ayla and getting her pregnant, for a couple of examples, because all that was predictable), but in the larger scheme of things this whole world was so unfamiliar to me that I just had no idea where it was going to go and what adventures they would have.I think some people dislike Ayla, claiming that she is a Mary Sue, but I did not think that about her at all. I did not find Ayla annoying, too smart for her own good, or unrealistically intelligent. For one thing, she might have been intellectually smart (because she was biologically made that way, which is hardly her fault!), but socially... she struggled a lot and wasn't too smart in that area. She often risked herself and her loved ones through her inability to adapt to the clan ways because her intelligence prevented her from functioning within them (she questioned things too often and was not a sheep!) and the concept of relinquishing who she was just to ""fit in"" was not in her nature and so had to be learned for survival reasons through tough lessons. As a result, she made big, cringe-worthy mistakes and she wasn't perfect, all of which made her more relatable and, if I might go so far as to say, human. ;) For another thing, although she was favored at times and often clan law did not seem to apply to her, I felt the allowances they made for her made sense in the context that Brun kept coming back to: what was best for the clan, not because they were necessarily favoring her. Yes, Ayla made some big leaps:- Constantly saving children from disaster through her eccentricities and earning the respect of the clan (I almost said ""ingratiating herself with the clan,"" but I don't feel that's accurate because it was her nature that drove her to do those things and not a desire to please the clan)- Figuring out that babies come from intercourse and are not acts of immaculate conception (like the rest of the clan thought; according to the clan, sex was for men to ""relieve"" themselves whenever they wanted as a dominance thing, whether the woman wanted it or not, though sometimes they enjoyed and encouraged it)- Catching on to ideas (like counting) quickly and surpassing the adults (even Creb) in many aspects like that- Teaching herself to hunt after watching a clansmen give a small child one lesson- Learning all of the herbalism knowledge despite not having the programmed memories for it- Basically inventing the braBut, to me, it was only natural for her to do all that, given her increased capacity to think things through and the basic concept of necessity being the mother of invention. I have no problem with how smart Ayla is because 1) she does have flaws and 2) that is the point of the whole book. She is a link to the future of the human race; it would make no sense for her to be stupid and make no big leaps. What Ayla is doing is no different than the leaps that the great thinkers of our time have made; no one calls Albert Einstein or Steven Hawking a Gary Stu, for example. I could see how Ayla could have been an extremely unlikable, unrelatable protagonist, but I felt the author did a great job of skirting that possibility altogether through the sensible way that everything fits together and culminates. I can think of three VERY annoying protagonists off the top of my head right now who are much better examples of Mary Sue types.I was kind of surprised about how spiritual it was. I am not sure if that was invented for the purposes of Ayla's story, or if there is evidence that early humans really believed in spirits and totems and if they were the center of their life like they were in this book. Like I said, I have limited knowledge in this area.I kept being thrown off guard by how young the characters were. Iza was considered old, but she was only 26 when she died (12 years younger than me!). Creb, Iza's oldest brother and the spiritual leader of their clan, was maybe 30 when he died and considered seriously ancient. Brun (the middle child and the only one still alive) is I'm going to guess 28 or so, but is no longer the clan leader because he's ""too old"" for the job. Even trying to allow for the fact that they were younger than expected while I was reading, I kept thinking Creb was like late 40s/early 50s, Brun was in his early 40s, and that Iza was maybe mid- to late-30s. Nope. They were at least 10 years younger even than that. Children were mating and having babies at eight-years-old and basically acting like adults who nowadays would be in their late 20s/early 30s. Their entire lives were lived in approximately 20 years and, if you made it past that, you were considered old. Really hard concept to grasp and understand, but I found it fascinating.My biggest criticism is that there were two major bits of endless waffling: one surrounding Ayla deciding whether to be a hunter and the other surrounding Brun deciding whether Broud should be a leader, especially since it was patently obvious that even though both of those things were really bad ideas, they had to happen so the story could go where it needed to go.After finishing the first book, there was no closure and it was obviously left as a (really good) cliffhanger. But, rather than feeling annoyed, I am left with wanting to know what happens to Ayla next, as well as Durc (her son), Broud (I keep hoping he will be killed off in a satisfying way), Brun (who I really grew to like a lot), and the clan itself. So, I plan to read the next two in the series, but I'll likely stop after that, given what I've read in reviews about the final three books."
1296,2697024951,liked it,"This is a great book. I have read numerous online reviews obsessed with questions of anthropology, of evolutionary biology vs. creationism: Did the author get it right about the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons? Is this thing just a racist tome, where the blonde-haired girl represents the brilliant conquerors of the future, and the darker Neanderthals are dying out? And what about the occasional non-fiction-style exposition wherein the author explains bits of science or anthropology—how dare she write with the dispassionate tone of a scholar! You can’t put that stuff in a story!But why write a nasty review for a book that is so easy to enjoy? Novelists traffic in words and voices. The ones spending so much time reading scholarly works are naturally going to employ the voice of a scholar from time to time. Can't a novelist expect a literate reader to be accustomed to such a voice, particularly when used sparingly? Why put so many rules on literature’s most free-wheeling genre, the novel? Last time I checked, writers could do pretty much anything in a novel, provided the story works and the readers are willing to accept it.I disagree with elements of this book on a most fundamental level. I can’t even explain how faulty I find the bedrock principles of so-called “evolutionary biology” and anthropology (though the quotation marks are a clue). But taken for what it is, I enjoyed this book. When I got to the end, I began reading the opening chapters of book two of the saga (included by the publisher to entice readers to buy the next book). I was engaged: What will happen to Ayla? It’s a good story. And not a bad illustration of an evolutionary point of view that, agree with it or not, is practically a religious origin story for many, many people. I was happy to find this window into another way of looking at the world.This book is entertaining from beginning to end. I cared about the characters. There were moments of humor and sadness, triumph and defeat, pride and joy. There were touching moments of love and tenderness, moments of hurt, and periods of despair. There is anger, hate, betrayal, and cold-blooded vengeance. There are heroes, villains, and moments of suspense that often made the book hard to put down. That’s a significant accomplishment for a book set in a bleak ice age, based on core beliefs I do not share, and with a dawning sense (the further I read) that the ending might not be satisfying—because it would leave me in suspense. (Though it contains a neat little ending, the final page is something like the hated phrase from television: to be continued. Even with these negatives, I had a blast reading this book--at home, at lunch, on treadmills at the gym, at the car repair shop...I can’t figure out what’s wrong with some of these reviewers. If you never read non-fiction, not to mention an occasional scholarly article, do you really have the fluent comprehension of written English required to write a reliable book review?I have to add that the author's research is astounding. Her grasp of plants used for medicinal purposes is extraordinary, not to mention the details, recipes practically, explaining how these herbal remedies, poultices, teas, and more are prepared and administered. Clearly she sought out experts on such things. Thus, the book becomes filled with the sights, sounds, tastes, and smells of all the plants of an ice-age world. Such detail adds a great deal of vivid imagery to the novel--this is a place you can see, taste, touch, and smell. But of course, these details also make the book a legitimate resource of its own. I would not exactly choose the book as a survival guide, were I to be lost during the summer in a valley in the Alps. But it is an amazing read if you have any interest in understanding the medicinal practices of aboriginal people the world over.Is this an accurate reporting of the medicinal practices of the Neanderthals? No. These are suppositions. For that matter, did the Neanderthals really have generational memories encoded in their brains? No. That's a theory based on extrapolations derived from skull fragments--maybe their brains were bigger in the memory area, and therefore.... Were Neanderthals unable to cry as portrayed? Were they unable to laugh or use a spoken language? Did Neanderthals even exist? Or are scientists still so desperately trying to find that missing link? It is my belief that anthropologists make far too much of far too little evidence.But so what? It's a great book, taken for what it is. Finally, I can't believe how many people I have run across on the internet (YouTube, mostly) writing comments about naming their child Ayla, or about the fact that their parents named them Ayla, and it meant so much once they read the book. Named after a fictional character? You do not hear THAT every day."
1296,2559297456,liked it,"An entertaining tale with some irksome things.World: I will say that the world buidling for this book is pretty stunning and the best thing about this book. I don’t know how scientifically accurate it is but it’s entertaining. The depth and the well thought out nature of the book is really well done and it is internally logically consistent which I enjoyed. I did not like however that the writer would constantly somewhat break the forth wall and explain to the reader the comparisons of what our modern idea and what the characters in the book would be feeling, those moments, which are often, would take me out of the book and also point out to me some character and story issues I would have (but more of that below). Mostly absolutely amazing, but not so great when the writer talks to us.Story: The story is fun, it’s a tale familar if you read enough pulp adventure and books set in this era, set in the old west, just any era where different cultures clashed and you had a character that was thrown into a different culture, this is that tale. It immediatly reminded me of Tarzan of the Apes by Burroughs and also Dances with Wolves the film so this is what you are getting but set in the pre-historic with Cro-Magnon and Neanderthals. It’s an interesting tale and the story plays out like the books above it where the main character goes through learning the ways of the tribe, is challenged for her oddness and also is seen to excell because of that oddness, it’s all there. There is a level of Mary Sue to Ayla the character when she’s surrounded by Neanderthals and Auel constantly talks to us to remind us that Ayla is surperior and talks of the modern times even of how eventually the Neaderthals will die out, it’s in these moments that I find myself losing my love for the book when it jarringly yanks be away from the story and into the writers exposition. As I said Ayla is a Mary Sue and much like this archetype of character it can’t be helped (more below). Overall the story is interesting, it’s fun and expected but the writing is sure and steady and leads readers by a firm strong hand. The book plays out much like the first half of Tarzan of the Apes where little Tarzan is found by a mother, raised and even finds a rival and then leaves the tribe, this is that story here. It’s good, but it’s a tale as old as time.Characters: Ayla is an interesting character and much like most fish out of water and the odd man out stories she lives and dies by how she’s written. Her situation is interesting so that will always serve her well and this is the case in this book. Her learning the ways of the clan and how she and the clan interact with her is the main part of the story and a main part of her character. Her finding her place and identity is a main part of her arc and it’s a slow and steady one. Yes this book was feminist for it’s time and honestly is a bit heavy handed, but it’s like that because she’s a Mary Sue. Just like Tarzan and John Carter and Mowgli these characters are raised by savages and animals and it’s the human side of them that wins out and always makes them superior and nearly always wins because of who they are. It’s fun, but this level of always winning eventually does get old. The struggles that Ayla faces here compared to the things she wins at is skewed and that’s just the way these characters are. The rest of the cast is interesting and falls well into the archetypes of these types of books with the mother the father, the proud and wise leader, the young angry rival, the clan that is wary of Alya and eventually stands by her, it’s all here and serves it’s purpose. It’s solid and expected stuff.I enjoyed the book, it’s not perfect but the world building was good and the world the book takes place in is interesting to me so I think I’ll keep reading.Onward to the next book!"
1296,2638953434,really liked it,"Way back in Junior High or perhaps early High School, I remember going on a family trip down to Myrtle Beach. Dad (the driver) had grabbed the audio cassettes of this book from the library for the trip and I fell in love with it. Upon returning, I grabbed a copy of this one to read for myself, and then the next book in the series, and then the next one... This was the first series I purchased with my own money and was the beginning of my collection that would one day eclipse 1000 books (now sadly gone)Coming back to the series to read again decades later, I had doubts if this would be as good for me now as it was in my teen years. Well, those doubts can be put to rest. This book is sooooooo good. Jean Auel is excellent at helping you step into the world she is building. Some might say that her descriptive narrative is a little too much information as she describes each and every flower or plant along with their medicinal uses or as she explains how the hunters will stalk and catch their prey but for me it gives a touch of reality. I don't think anyone is as well researched for this type of book as she is. The book is not just a description of prehistoric neanderthal life. The plot itself is very gripping and well paced. It begins with a five year old girl who loses her family in an earthquake and after near starvation is found and adopted by a clan of ""flatheads"". It then follows her life over the next 6 or seven years as she learns and grows and has adventures unique to a human child being raised by a group who live and think and act in completely alien ways. The only reason I have not given this five stars is because I could not get past the fact that this girl at the oldest is only twelve. I understand that in this time and age life was lived quicker. People matured earlier and the old folks in this book are late twenties up to an ""ancient"" mid thirties. Even still some absolutely horrible things happen to this girl and while it fits into the story I could not get past the fact that she was ten years old, or later eleven years old when they happen. It is not OK for anyone at any age to suffer some of what she suffered but for a ten year old child... It just reminds me that not all cultures are created equal. Good and evil are absolutes and not necessarily culturally determined.Anyways, this is an excellent book. I understand that there was once a movie made from it. I never saw that movie but I would strongly recommend reading the book instead. I cannot imagine even the greatest producer with an unlimited budget and perfect actors being able to come close to touching the things that make this such an excellent masterpiece."
1296,1544290041,liked it,"I sort of understand the hype around this series. And by hype I mean the intermittent popularity of the series with customers at work. Colleagues have said they only continued to the third book in the series and after completing this one, I don't think I'm in any rush to read any of the others. The book got repetitive for me. There were a few instances where a character would explain something in one situation and then explain it again in another situation. There were even instances where the narrator explained lengthy things more than once. I know the following is an irrational reason to dislike this book in particular but I can't help it. I just couldn't deal with the de-elevation and treatment of women in this book. There is supplication, rape, abuse etc. I realise its set in the stone age and these were normal behaviours for cave men and early Neanderthal, so yeah. Irrational dislike. I also struggled with the amount of wilful killing, both of animals and babies in this book. They'd kill things ""for the spirits"" or if it came too close to the cave or the fire or the skins they were drying. Then they'd kill babies if they were twins or triplets. Or if they had a slight deviation in appearance or were as they called them ""deformed babies"" Ayla had a baby that looked like her (an early human similar in appearance to modern man) and they wanted to kill it. Just annoyed me a lot, but is also probably a result of them missing parts of what we know as the modern brain. And a good explanation for why they died out. The writing was decent enough, but I struggled with the execution of the concept itself. In general, not really a series for me."
1296,316490098,liked it,"3.5 stars.I find the study of early humankind fascinating. In this novel, Auel weaves a story of a homo sapien child who is adopted by a clan of Neanderthals. After a major earthquake, Ayla (a toddler), was seriously wounded and almost dead when the Neanderthal clan stumbled upon her while looking for a new cave to settle into. Ayla is taken in by the medicine woman and becomes part of their clan. Ayla follows in her adoptive mother's footsteps and also becomes a medicine woman. She identifies with her adoptive clan more than she identifies with ""The Others"" (homosapiens) although her physical characteristics are distinctly different. She cries tears, laughs, and has advanced language skills which are lacking among the Neanderthals. After she is brutally raped by a Clansman (a common occurence in clan society), she gives birth to a son (Durk). The Clan believes he is deformed because he is a mix of Neanderthal and homosapien, but Ayla is allowed to keep him.Although the writing was a bit simplistic and redundant at times, the storyline kept me enthralled, and I may move on to the next one in the Earth's Children series."
1296,1617022637,really liked it,"When this book was released in 1981, it seemed like everyone I knew read it - except me.  Even as the years went by and I found myself loving historical fiction, I still didn't bother to pick it up.  Somehow, I couldn't imagine a story of cave-dwellers would interest me.  Luckily, I succumbed to reading The Clan of the Cave Bear this month when a book challenge required the word ""cave"" in the title.  I figured so many rave reviews couldn't be wrong.  And they weren't.Approximately 25,000 years ago, the ancestors of our own human race lived at the same time as the Neanderthal race, which eventually became extinct.  Author Jean Auel ponders the mingling of the two races in this text.  After an earthquake kills off all the member of her clan, young Ayla is left to fend for herself.  After a narrow escape with a mountain lion, she stumbles upon a clan of Neanderthals and is eventually adopted into the clan.  Auel manages to create a timeless human story.  Fitting in, growing up, love and loss are themes the author weaves throughout this excellent novel.  I'm so glad I finally read this one!"
1296,2683907785,did not like it,"DNF'd 10% I just don't think this one is for me. I just feel that either you make a historically accurate book or you make a fantasy book. Either you do the first and yeah, it makes sense that its a horribly misogynistic society where women are oppressed and not allowed to do anything. Or its the second and there should be no reason to have it that way, right? I just felt very annoyed while reading this. I also hated how the woman literally couldn't hunt because that's just how their brains work. Give me a freaking break. Also the description of young boys just hitting puberty having sex with girls who haven't even started their periods yet is so disturbing to me on so many levels. Just no. And even if that is whats happening, must you describe it? 🤢"
1296,2540966218,really liked it,"I enjoyed this book much more than I anticipated. I thought cave men would be a boring read, but hell, I was sucked right in. Jean M. Auel did an insanely impressive job immersing the reader into a highly complex and intricate world in which survival is not guaranteed. Ayla may not have been born into the clan tribe (she clearly looks different, she's lean, tall, and has blond hair), but she begrudgingly gets their acceptance after she is taken in as a child by the clan's medicine women. Ayla learns to communicate with them using movement, not sounds, and learns the clan hierarchy and tools for survival. It's a coming of age story set in the ice age and it is way more engrossing then I ever thought. I'm honestly tempted to continue on with the series! The ending was a bit of a shock!"
1296,2558171951,it was ok,"This book just goes on and on and on We get it! Ayla is not clan. Bloody hell I think this is the most repetitive book I’ve ever read. That fact is probably mentioned in every single page and this book is 502 pages long. It’s just the same old rubbish all the way through. I thought at one point Ayla was going to die and I honestly was so excited. The love from Iza is nice, I find Brun a good leader. Broud is portrayed well and is a good ol’ mean character that everyone loves to hate. It was just so repetitive and it was tendinous to read. This was recommended by a co-worker as her favourite book...... I won’t be listening to her again "
1296,2432497405,really liked it,"A really good read undercut by a pretty weak ending. It was a little cliffhanger-ish (and predictable) after 450-odd pages.Parts of it reminded me of Quest for Fire, the 1981 movie about interactions between a Cro-Magnon tribe and various outsiders. The tip-off that this was written by a woman and Quest filmed by a man:Among Ayla's inventions: The world's first sports bra.Among Ika's (the character played by Rae Dawn Chong in the movie): The world's first blow job."
1296,1779094124,,"I can tell already that I'm not in the mood for this book. My grandmother on my mom's side recommended me these a long time ago a said ""read these when you're older, you'll like them"", and I think she's right, but right now I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to books so I'm going to wait until I get that patience back to read this.

1296,1226596912,it was amazing,"My mom loved this book in the 80's. I've been intrigued by it ever since, but recently I finally decided to read it in her memory on the anniversary of her death. See my blog post for more on that and on the first half of the book: http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/20...I may not be entirely objective given my reasons for reading this, but I can honestly say that I loved this book. It's a surprisingly deep and emotionally poignant imagining of women and men not that different from ourselves who lived about 30,000 years ago.Although this book was well researched for the time (circa 1980), in my blog post (http://examinedworlds.blogspot.com/20...) I also wrote about the aspects of Auel's story that have turned out to be inaccurate.But, as much as I love the paleoanthropological aspects of the book, this is a novel, not a textbook. And as a novel, it works. I love the style, the characters, the plot, and the bigger ideas.The style isn't everyone's cup of tea. If you're one of those readers who complains about authors who violate some sacred ""show don't tell"" rule, then Auel's detailed descriptions of flora, fauna, inner thoughts, omniscient narration, etc. is going to bother you. I think that sort of thing is essential world building, which I appreciate as a science fiction fan. Auel isn't just telling a story, she's transporting the reader deep into a forgotten world of the past. I also find Auel's style to be occasionally beautiful, especially her descriptions of the landscape and passing of the seasons.The characters are fleshed out people not entirely different from characters you meet in the 21st century. That most of them are Neanderthals makes little difference. Part of what's so amazing about this is just the thought that there were living, breathing women and men who lived, loved, and thought just like people today. As a Cro-Magnon adoptee into a Neanderthal clan, Ayla is a permanent outsider, but she forms deep and complex connections with members of the clan, especially her adoptive parents, medicine woman Iza and Creb, who is the clan's shaman or Mog-ur. Both are fascinating characters in their own right. Ayla's main nemesis, Broud, is a misogynistic bully who would be as at home on some 21st century MRA/Gamergater/Rabid Puppy blog as he is on a pleistocene mammoth hunt. The ways in which Ayla challenges and navigates her patriarchal society is, I imagine, one of the things my mom identified with most, especially as a single mother pursuing a business career in the 80's and 90's.The plot is engrossing, even during the several stretches when it seems like not much is going on (there's always *something* going on, even if it's more to contribute to the world building than the plot per se). The conclusion is, while not entirely surprising, entirely heartbreaking.Besides all this, the novel raises a lot of questions about gender, culture, differences, and what it means to be human, whether of the modern or Neanderthal variety. Ayla and Creb have some deep thoughts (and a few hallucinations) about what to make of the differences and relations between the Clan and the Others. Can they get along? Must one die for the other to live? Can there be future for both in some sense?As much as I love most things about the book, I admit that I'm a little disturbed by the hint that a blonde-haired blue-eyed person is part of a superior race. You could say that this is merely a trope to highlight Ayla's permanent outsider status, but now that we know that blonde hair and blue eyes are much more recently developed traits, this is factually inaccurate in addition to its touch of subtle racism. There is also frequent violence against women, but it's not usually too graphic and does add to the intentionally(?) troubling aspects of the plot. For a series that people often describe as soft core cave man porn, sex is usually only mentioned in this book. There are a few brutal rape scenes, which are disturbing but not terribly graphic, but that can't be what people are talking about. I guess the fun sexy times must happen in the later books.Speaking of the later books, the near-universal consensus seems to be that they take a huge nose dive in quality after the first book. I'll probably pick up the second one just to see what happens next, but I'll keep my expectations low.In the meantime, I am in awe of Auel. The research may be outdated and there are some problems, but over all The Clan of the Cave Bear is an engaging, well-written novel that somehow makes bestseller material out of paleoanthropological speculation. Auel must be a Mog-ur to have made this magic happen."

1296,1196631787,really liked it,"Este libro lleva tantísimo en mis estanterías pero es que siempre lo miraba y me decía a mi misma dos cosas: 1) me gustara? 2) es tan tremendamente gordo que me pillara mucho tiempo!. Este libro llego a mis estanterías gracias a una compañera de trabajo que siempre me decía que estaba leyendo este libro y que le encantaba la niña de esta historia, que estaba totalmente enamorada. Ahora la entiendo. Hará unos 6 años de esa primera conversación y un dia fui al fnac y me traje los tres primeros, luego fui trayéndomelos todos poco a poco pero muy poco a poco ya que la gente manosea mucho los libros en esta tienda y estaban tan mal cuidados. Al final me traje todos menos el ultimo. Este año he decidido no hacer ningún reto, fuera del reto got que acabo el mes que viene. Y he decidido leer tochos , ya que siempre los voy apartando y leo pequeños o no superiores a 500.Bueno he leido algunos pero siempre por el reto got. Bueno el caso es que este también lo agarre porque necesitaba un libro que tuviera un oso en la portada y no tenia en casa ninguno excepto este así que decidí que era el momento adecuado. Y no he podido enamorarme mas, es de estos libros que tras vas ir leyendo la historia, ves como la autora describe, y como hace que sean los personajes te vas enamorando poco a poco y no puedes dejar de leer. De echo este libro lo empece creo que por ahi por diciembre y lo deje simplemente porque según los retos que tenia que cumplir solo me dejaba al dia la posibilidad de leer 13 paginas diarias y no lo estaba saboreando lo suficiente, siempre era un ""ya?tengo que parar ya? pero si yo quiero seguir leyendo"". Refiriendome a la historia a sido muy bonito ver como esta niña Ayla va creciendo poco a poco y se va introduciendo en un clan que no es el suyo. Esta claro que la autora quiere enseñarnos un poco como eran las vista de los neardentales antes de que apareciera el homosapien. Es cierto que parece que esta niña esta un poco maldita porque todo va de mal en peor, y cuando ve un poco de luz al poco otra vez todo vuelve a ir mal. Durante la historia no para de perder gente a su alrededor, algunos me rompieron el corazoncito. La historia tiene personajes de todos los estilos, dulces, crueles, tristes, etc. Te puedes sentir identificado con multiples. Quiero destacar altunos Iza, una madre que aunque no es su verdadera madre trata a Ayla como si lo fuera, estando para ella en todo momento. Crug no es su padre pero es tan agradable ver que hay posibilidad de que un hombre tan duro pueda ablandarse tanto al tener un beber cerca. Brun un gran jefe que llevare en mi corazón siempre, me ha parecido tan increíble como era duro, blando, amable, siempre cambiando cuando se necesitaba. Y por ultimo señalar a uno de los personajes mas crueles que he visto en mi vida Broud que pena no poder sacar a un personaje del libro y poder quemarlo vivo!. Voy a empezar a contar las cosas que no me ha gustado tanto y que han hecho que en vez de ponerle un 5 redondo le haya bajado un poco la nota: Resulta que esta autora pues a veces repite una misma idea varias veces, es capaz de hacer que Ayla se de cuenta de una cosa y la repita varias veces, y eso a veces pues no es que se ponga pesado pero si dices ¿otra vez?. Otra de las cosas que he visto que me ha chirreado un poco es que ha alargado el libro, al repetir cosas y poner cosas poco interesante que podía haber dejado tal vez en 300 paginas. Por estos pocos motivos le he quitado un punto aun con la esperanza de que el siguiente sea tan tementramente que supere al primero."
1296,934640718,really liked it,"This book is set in pre-history and is about a clan of Neanderthals who adopt a young girl from a different species – Homo Sapiens. The story is an interesting one of survival, tradition, male – female relationships and how a tight knit small community hangs together for survival. Life in the Neanderthal clan is fascinating. Their rigid code of conduct, their survival techniques and their reliance on faith is prevalent on every action each member of the clan makes. The most interesting part of the book was the reliance of the clan on spiritual guidance. It gives an insight of life before organised religion and to an extent, also why religions were so readily accepted. The clan is extremely patriarchal, which in itself could have been realistic, but its depiction left me unconvinced. The main attraction for me was the question on how and when patriarchy became so deeply entrenched in human psyche. In the book, it was already codified into human behaviour around 35000 years ago. I’m not convinced it happened so early but it’s an interesting question the book raises. Most of the characters are brilliant and it was a pleasure to read about them. Each of them have a different function to fulfil in the clan, and the fulfilment of those functions also makes them who they are. It is brilliantly depicted at every turn how different they are to each other and the interpersonal relationships are also very interesting in such a hierarchal setting. However, when it comes to Ayla’s character, the author missed the boat. Ayla is a mixture of Emmeline Pankhurst, Alexander Fleming, Hippocrates, James Bond, Jim Corbett, Charles Darwin, Socrates, Marilyn Monroe, Leontina Albina, Michael Phelps and the average housewife. Then she becomes God and is today known under the names of Buddha, Jesus, Allah, Krishna, Yahweh ... well, not really, but almost! She is an ace swimmer, ace hunter, ace cook, ace doctor, ace everything! Ayla can survive anything at all and she is oh, so strong, that no amount of abuse can break her. Even being serial raped leaves her disinterested and bored as if she were just brushing off flies. She rescues two babies (TWO!) – one might happen to anyone, but TWO babies. She can survive all alone in a cave by herself – in WINTER – twice! She also discovers how the reproductive system works and single-handedly sets the course of evolution. Okay, I’ll stop now and talk about the cave lions and cave bears and woolly mammoths who roam this world. The author has beautifully brought forth the appeal and character of these amazing creatures which are now extinct. I never thought I would enjoy a story that has so much hunting in it, but I really loved the hunting scenes. The way the animals and plants were used with absolutely no wastage was intriguing. The relationship between early humans and nature is beautifully depicted. The respect shown to these animals by their hunters is now only a distant memory in our history. The author has really drawn a way of life that has been practically done away with today. In spite of the Mary Sue main character, it is an interesting book which deals with some very interesting questions about life, leadership, survival and relationships. I do highly recommend it as it was an enjoyable read. Even the main character is toned down a little once we reach the last part of the book, which leaves you with a sense of believability. "
1296,2249370404,liked it,"I really wanted to like this book, especially after all the good things I'd heard. However, unfortunately, this was just not for me. Way too long, too much description, not enough dialogue/action... Won't be reading the other parts of the series. Simply not the read for me."
1296,862543251,really liked it,"The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M Auel, is an enthralling tale set at dawn humanity, that will captivate within it's first few chapters. The story follow the life and trials of Ayla, a young, Cro-Magnon girl, as she develops into a young woman, following an earthquake that separates her from family, leading the girl to find refuge within a Neanderthal clan.The book sets a slow pace from the very beginning and continues much the same throughout the remainder of this 502 page novel. Though written well for the most part, it does occasionally stumble. Details are frequently reiterated, which quickly becomes tedious; and let's not forget those large excerpts of heavy info-dumping where Auel will Linger on fauna or the surrounding landscape, resulting from the Author's renowned in-depth research of this time period. This, although noticeable and often irksome, surprisingly doesn't detract from the overall narrative and despite the intermittent periods of lag, there is plenty along the way to keep you turning the pages.As a reader you'll quickly find yourself drawn into the intricacies of Clan life and it's memorable characters who dwell within the Cave. You will grow attached to Ayla's adoptive mother, Iza and her brother, the menacing Mog-ur (Creb); come to respect Brun's wise and stoic leadership; and detest the cruel actions of his successor, Boud. Though, with names like Zoug, Vorn, Oga, Norg and Ebra, it can sometimes prove difficult to remember who belongs to which hearth when it comes to some of the background characters.This novel really shines bright when it comes to the dialogue, or lack-there-of, between characters. The followers of Ursus communicate via hand gestures and this proves to be one of the many cultural barrier between the two species, as the young Ayla struggles to suppress her instinctive nature and adopt Clan behavior. You'll find yourself relating to her struggles as she battles between what comes to her naturally and what is expected of her.My only grip: There isn't a semblance of plot to be found, seemingly. This book never sets a clear direction for it's main character and leaves you feeling as though you're just there existing with the Neanderthals, taking each day (or chapter in this case) as it comes. Though there is no shortage in terms of world-building, with plenty to delve into, you may find yourself left wondering where this series is going and if it can sustain itself.I pray that Auel's sequel, second in a series of six, 'The Valley of Horses', can build upon the foundations that she has so expertly built in her debut, The Clan of the Cave Bear. This series shows a lot of promise and is worth a read simply due to it's uniqueness and setting in a relatively unexplored time-period."
1296,1257897736,liked it,"Allora. Io già conosceva Ayla e già avevo una vaga idea di cosa la aspettava e cosa doveva succederle, quindi non ho avuto una grande sorpresa sul finale. In ogni caso.Questo libro ha dei punti forti: ha una bella trama, con colpi di scena sparsi, uno stile piuttosto piacevole e scorrevole, e dei comprimari molto ben costruiti e molto affascinanti. IN pratica, il libro merita anche solo per la divina triade Iza, Creb e Brun, tre fratelli porcellini che si vogliono tanto bene e che hanno tutti e tre la stessa aura di rispetto e saggezza. E, diciamocelo, per le descrizioni dei vari espedienti di sopravvivenza e delle usanze del Clan. Se si trattasse solo di questo, direi WOW.No. Non dico WOW. Dico porcami dioca mavaffa grazie agli Dei ho finito. Sostanzialmente per due motivi. Il primo, purtroppo piuttosto rilevante, è che la Auel, che benedetta donna si è fatta i suoi bravi studi ma ormai purtroppo sono superati, si dilunga troppo nelle descrizioni dei paesaggi, dell'ambiente naturale e tutto il resto, che sembra un catalogo della vita dell'Homo Neanderthaliensis. E' un elenco di nomi di piante. Ora, Jean, ho capito che hai studiato, non c'è proprio bisogno che mi ripeti ogni due pagine del boschetto di nocciole o dell'infuso per curare il mal di denti. Per carità, tutte cose utili, ma è un romanzo, non archeologia sperimentale. Salvatemi dalla caparbietà dei nani dal catalogo di preistoria, c'ho già dato de esami e mi è bastato.Il secondo sono Ayla e Brud. Questo romanzo ha uno sviluppo sorprendente: all'inizio ami Ayla e odi Brud dal più profondo del cuore. Alla fine Brud ti fa quasi pena e Ayla ti sta sul cazzo: a parte il fatto che lui ti deve stare antipatico, è costruito apposta, e la cosa mi fa girare, ma poi lei sembra scamparla sempre. E' il ritratto sputato della Mary Sue: dicasi Mary Sue il personaggio femminile perfetto che la scampa sempre e sa sempre tutto più degli altri, è più speciale di tutti gli altri e tutti la amano tranne lo stronzo di turno. Che in questo caso, letteralmente, non è cattivo, è che lo disegnano così: Brud è uno stronzo costruito ad arte per fare risaltare lei ancora di più. Ed è una cosa insopportabile.Alla fine dò un voto piuttosto alto perchè comunque come romanzo non è male, se riesci a farti piacere Ayla e salti i cataloghi da villaggio del Neolitico. Preferisco comunque La Valle dei Cavalli, lì almeno ci sono membri a ogni piè sospinto."
1296,1685395019,did not like it,"How do I end up reading creative books by terrible Oregonian authors? I finished this book only because it was obvious the research was well done and the author had a good creative vision for it. But the writing was painful. Even more painful than 'dies the fire' because at least the action in that series was great. Dies the fire was written by an amateur writer who focused all his energy on creativity and action and despite his mistakes it was a fun read. In this all the energy of research and well developed characters was thrown out the door with narration and obvious statements. I regret reading Clan of the cave bear. The author is not an amateur writer and she chose to lecture on Neolithic culture and she chose to bounce constantly between views and voices. Only for the respect of the well developed characters did I finish the book. There was also a weird dimension where the narrator would describe the root cause or fullest line of info, for example the narrator voice spent time describing brain sizes and flower types of the ancient past, as well as tuberculosis and telepathy. There is no way the the characters benefited from this. Also, as a language the whole clan used sign language and one syllable words, yet they communicated words and emotions they didn't have words for. It was a consistent plot hole for me.  Maybe it was an editor that messed this book up. because I could tell the structure was good and the author did excellent research and character back stories, but instead of introducing a character through the eyes of a main character she would jump first person into a random character that will never matter again. And after a scene she would consistently summarize the whole scene with a single sentence which disrespected the reader and made the whole paragraph pointless. So either she is just a terrible writer or an editor asked for odd summaries frequently and it ruined it. Either way there are better books out there to read."
1296,203550355,liked it,"This is one of those books I'd heard of growing up and felt compelled to read because of its unique setting. I don't know many other books whose main characters are cave people. Before reading this, I read up a little on the author and her research and was impressed with the amount of time she put into this endeavor, as well as her commitment to stick closely to the truth or at least what was believed to be the truth back then. I read all 500 pages of this tale sort of waiting for something to happen. Weird enough since stuff happens to Ayla, the tall, thin, big boobed, blond girl heroine, all the time, but yet, nothing made me feel anything. Yes, the book is vividly alive with descriptions of scenery, shrubbery, fauna, flora, scents, weather, and of course, the author's dedication to honing a ""real"" story is evident and applauded by this writer here, but damn, I still feel the bruise on the back of my head where Auel beat the tale into me. How many times can one read the same passages over and over again placed in different parts of the book and felt by different characters? The struggle for Ayla to be accepted became so redundant, I wanted her to pack her shit up and go look for the Others about halfway through the book. I don't know if at the time Auel wrote this, she was trying to write an affirmative book about a female heroine, but if she was, here's my 2014 opinion on it: FAIL. Oh anyway, I don't feel like ranting about this. Not worth it. But, if you are looking to be transported to another time and place and maybe learn a thing or two about plants, making tools, and skinning animals, and if you are vaguely interested about our ancient ancestors, this is a ""classic"" I suppose.However, I still feel I had a much better time with Quest for fire."
1296,135057492,it was amazing,"It's been a long time since I've sat down and completely devoured a book. You know how it goes. You crack open the book, and from the first few words, you're hooked. You can't stop. You stay up until 2 a.m. even though you have a work appointment bright and early the next morning. You keep the book in your purse so you can sneak in a few paragraphs at an especially long red light.That's what this book was for me.It was an absolute treat. From the first sentence to the last, I enjoyed every single word Jean Auel wrote. In fact, I'm thinking about adding her to my Christmas card list. I love her that much.The plot was fantastic. (A young girl left to fend for her own is assimilated into a family group, resulting in all sorts of conflict.) The setting was insane. (This book is written in pre-historic times. Like, mammoth hunts, cave dwellings, the whole shebang.) The characters are brilliant. (They have personalities that practically jump off the page.) The climax blows your mind. (Not going to tell you, because that would ruin it, and I don't want to do that to you.)The best part of all, though, in my opinion, was that Ms. Auel created a world that was essentially a biology lesson. Seriously, I wish my science teacher had described neanderthals and cro-magons like this when I was in school. I might've passed the class.In conclusion, let me say this. When I die, I hope God sits me at the table with Ms. Auel, Ms. Diana Gabaldon and Ms. Margaret Mitchell. I think that would be pure heaven."
1296,69415152,liked it,"Clan of the Cave Bear is the story of Ayla, a 5 year old Homo Sapien who is stranded in the wild after an earthquake killed her family. She is adopted by the Clan (i assume, considering the time period, that this is Homo Erectus. i don't believe it's mentioned in the book) who take her in and teach her their ways.i was a bit put off when first opening this book. Ms Auel uses very clinical language in her narratorial descriptions, which i found distracting. once i realized that this was on purpose however, i got used to the language and actually found it extremely interesting.Auel goes into incredible depth regarding everything from landscape & character descriptions to the flora & fauna characteristic of the time period. some of the most interesting tidbits i thought were her explanations of the Clan-folk themselves; her reasoning behind the extended occipital lobes, memory and extrapolation, the differences between the minds of H. Sapiens and H. Erectus. as (not even) a layman of human evolution, i found it very compelling.the story itself is a bit dry at times, riveting at others; i found myself struggling in the middle of chapters, waiting for a good place to break and go to bed, only to be sucked back in by the end and continuing right on into the next. while i'm not sure i would rave about it, Clan of the Cave Bear is quite good, and i look forward to continuing the series."
1296,809963331,liked it,"I bought this book along with the rest of the series (bar one) on a whim. It looked interesting as the series was almost complete. My wife took the lead and read the first book. I was soon confronted with empty supper tables and an empty space next to me in bed at night. This was a sure sign that she was caught in the ban of the Earth’s Children. When she was again communicative to the outside world, she said: “You’ve just got to read them; they are just what you would love.” If anyone knows my hates, likes and loves, it is she. This said I opened the book and started to read. The first hundred pages went slowly and I was constantly looking for the moment I would get caught up in the tale. It was along time in coming…. I don’t know if the strange and confusing names were the cause or maybe I just wasn’t inspired by the repetitive and boring life of the hunter/gatherer. Interactions between Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnons were almost certainly a common occurrence but the plight of the young girl Ayla didn’t initially inspire me. Child mistreatment and slavery isn’t a very inspiring base of existence but thankfully the circumstances changed as the story progressed. Probably not having a mental picture of the heroine slowed the process. When I substituted the image of Eila Adams (one of the regular anchors from Naked News) onto the main character, my imagination took off. "
1296,1480768464,it was amazing,"This, when I received it as a gift was not my sort of book at all, it took me forever to pick it up. However once I did I was glad I had, I flew through it and rushed out to get the sequels, of which 4 more were available at the time. I enjoyed each book, though I did find some points a little tiresome by book 5. Really? Is there anything Ayla doesn't know more about that=n anybody else, can nobody else invent some life changing method/tool? Also I felt Ayla didn't develop very much in the last book it felt a bit forced and could have been smaller. The sixth book that I waited a good few years for I hated, pre-ordering the book and rushing to get it as soon as the shop opened. Disappointed didn't cover it, it took me months to finish it, I just wasn't interested. I am now re-reading the whole series to see if it is any better the second time round. I felt the author had obviously put a lot of time into researching to be able to accurately describe parts of the book and I enjoyed how much detail she had put in. As somebody who is very ignorant in that part of history, it was probably easier for me to enjoy than somebody who is more educated in the area. Overall I really enjoyed this first book and the characters within it as a fiction book with a storyline that interested me and main characters that kept me reading."
1296,82348058,really liked it,"I am starting my umpteenth re-read of CotCB. This book is engrossing, and I believe that many people write it off prematurely due to the subject matter. I assure you, I was skeptical the first time I read this book. Cavemen. Ok. The way that the lives and experiences of the characters, Ayla (main character) especially, are described in this book is just amazing. One of my teachers gave me this book to read shortly after it was removed from the high school reading list (I believe) and let me know that it was removed because the subsequent books in the series were too racy to be high school reading. Well, I was reading VC Andrews and my mom's romance novels at the time, so let's revise that to say typical high school reading. As I have read the entire series, I will go ahead and agree with her. The rest of the books in this series are half smut to say the least! This book though...if I can just make a plea with you, reader of my review. If this book has ever crossed your path....if you have ever seen it and thought ""blech"" or thought ""meh"" - just give it a try! I am a firm believer in not wasting your time on a horrible book, so, you can always DNF! Ayla deserves a chance. Also, I am in no way speaking out against smut - just might not be what you are thinking when you think ""cavemen"". I'm going to repeat my plea here. Give Ayla a chance. She's an amazing woman!! "
1296,104939713,it was amazing,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it so many times that I have the first paragraph committed to memory. I can remember the first time I read it, I was maybe 12 or so, and I could not put it down. I remember feeling shock, awe, fear, sadness, and warmth throughout the book, and I was inconsolable at the end. Ever since, I have wanted to name my daughter (assuming that I have one) Ayla, after the main character. I just really love the premise of this book, the meeting of Neanderthals and modern humans, and I fell in love with the characters (I even had a one-eyed cat that I named Creb). I did not, unfortunately, love the sequels. I read them, of course, b/c I care so much about Ayla and what happens to her, but I did not care for the turn that the sequels took. They got a little smutty, almost a romance novel, each one worse than the preceding one, and I didn't like the way that she made Ayla so perfect. Ayla was a compelling character before, Auel had no need to make her so...well, I said it- perfect. Like, it turns out that she's the first one to tame horses, and lions, she invented the sewing needle, and the spear thrower, and she's the most beautiful human on Earth, etc...it just got to be too much, and it aggravated me. Which is sad, b/c I love Ayla so. Well, Valley of the Horses wasn't bad, I liked it OK. "
1296,205003850,liked it,"I've read this book twice before, as far as I recall. The first time was probably eighth grade? The second time was probably high school? I don't remember exactly when. I was surprised at how much of the story was completely familiar to me. I was even more surprised I read it when I was young and wasn't completely disgusted by the sex talk (""his pulsing organ""). Oh yeah, and that one section of the book where she was continually raped for like a year.Yeah...There's a lot of repetition and explaining. Almost the entire book is blocks of paragraphs. The story manages to make a ton of bad things happen to Ayla, but her inner monologue made me cringe every time it came up, so I did not find her easy to sympathize with. I realize now that I remember the EVENTS of the story, but the characters were completely forgettable. There were entire story arcs that I remembered but had no clue it involved other people. Every character had the same voice, and they never really grew. Broud was introduced as a jerk and stayed a jerk. Brun was introduced as a thoughtful leader who took his time, and stayed that way. No one evolved."
1296,618879351,really liked it,"Este libro me encanto más que nada por la época que retrata. Creo que es el primer libro en mi vida que habla del Neanderthal y del cromagnon así. Retrata todo a detalle, realmente me vi en esa época, realmente olí la humedad de la cueva y sentí el frío de los inviernos.Lo mejor de todo es que además los personajes cautivan, todos. Brun, Broud, Ovra, Creb, Ayla, Iza, todos cautivan, tienen bien definida su personalidad y cada uno a su forma se lleva una parte de mi o yo me quedo con una parte de ellos.Me gustaron varias cosas, una, la época, dos los totems, tres el problema social que representó Ayla para el clan y el tiempo que les tomo aceptarla no se aleja mucho de lo que HOY nos toma aceptar las cosas nuevas, digan lo que digan, nos parecemos mucho a esos hombres de las cuevas. Es probable que más de lo que creemos.Me gustó todo, no le doy todas las estrellas porque no es el único libro de la serie, y quiero ver si el que sigue es igual de intenso que el clan del oso cavernario.Se lo recomendaría a cualquier persona que se este iniciando en la aventura de la lectura."
1296,202504048,it was amazing,"The Clan of the Cave Bear remains one of my all-time favorite books. The story is rather simplistic, but it's elemental to anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. When I discovered it in my teenage years, I was just coming to accept that I was gay. Living in Idaho in a society that viewed me as a pariah, I immediately connected with Ayla and her struggles to conform to a culture that was as alien to her as she was to it. This is not a quick and easy read by any stretch. It's rich with lavish detail, often lapsing into long, descriptive passages about the flora and fauna, or the invented culture of the Clan. I personally never balked at this, but it may not be to some readers' tastes. Ultimately, though, the message--that one can rise above a lifetime of ostracism and emerge with a sense of self-worth founded on familial love--guided me through my formative years and still serves me today.Later books in the series resonated less with me, but this one... this one will always hold a special place in my heart."
1296,2503422976,really liked it,"I recently bought a house so I've had a lot less time to write book reviews. Well, I've also read a string of crumby books which almost choked me of my passion to read. That is until now. This is the best book I've read in months.Firstly, it's about ancient man and neanderthals. It's a lot like THE WORLD'S OLDEST VAMPIRE TELLS ALL except without the orgies... and it had a good story. But the best thing is that this book stars an excellent strong female character. The biggest problem with the modern strong female character is that it is written, for the most part, by third wave feminists. This means that string female characters are written as men. This is not only dumb but it's boring. Women are not men. They're not worse or better than men. They are their very own wonderful thing and though the MC in this book did best a man or two at traditionally male activities she is still written as a female. Not a strong chick that acts like a dude but a genuinely strong and interesting WOMAN... Well, cave-woman...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1296,327290523,it was amazing,"It took me a little while to get into this book, but I think that's because I was reading it on and off in my lunch breaks at work and could only read a couple of chapters a couple of times a week. By the time I was about 150 pages in, though, I was hooked.I loved Ayla's character and the way she evolves during the story. It is a journey the reader really does take with her and I was full immersed in her tale. I'm not surprised this book was turned into a film as it really lends itself to the screen with interesting characters and plenty of dramatic action. I'm keen to try to check out the film version in the future and see what it's like - even though it was a box office flop.But back to the book - great story-telling, believable and well-rounded characters and a big finale make this a series I look forward to continuing with. This is highly recommended and I shall be adding the rest of the series to my wish list."
1296,301481833,really liked it,"So this has been on my list of stuff to read for an incredibly long time - I even borrowed it from work a few times, intending to read it, but was caught up in other stuff or simply put off by the length (anything over 350-400 pages is 'long' in my book) - finally forced myself to sit down with it for a few hours and get stuck in, and I was engrossed almost immediately.Still took me a week to finish, but when I did read it I couldn't put it down and had many a night with less sleep than I ought to have because I had been up til 3am reading. More like a prehistorical drama than a fantasy novel, the amount of research and effort that has been put into it beggars belief. As a self-professed dinosaur/anything prehistorical nerd, I learned some stuff, and that's impressive. There is a bit of a fantasy slant to it, with a bit of magic and mindready stuff going on, but yeah read more like a caveman Neighbours. Not that that's a bad thing at all."
1296,183977537,it was amazing,"I value the honesty of portions of this novel very highly. My mother was brutally held hostage and repeatedly raped when she was 18-19. Reading about Ayla gave me a place to understand some small portion of what my mother went through. My mother also was able to move beyond her rape and rapist to lead a full and satisfying life, though the effects will always be with her, like with Ayla. Speaking of the ""unspeakable"" helps both those who've experienced such harm and those who haven't to have a shared ""vocabulary"" if you will and being able to relate to a relatable fictional character who went through something very realistic to ease the difficulty of the conversation helped us many times over.The visceral way in which these characters live and breath has been with me for over 22 years... and I am grateful for them and to Ms Auel for sharing them with us! This is probably my all time favorite ""what if this is what happened"" ancient times series ever. "
1296,1564742851,it was ok,"This book gave me huge highs and lows. I loved the setting, and the way I felt I knew the characters, even the secondary characters. Jean M. Auel's description of life in prehistoric Europe is engaging, both full of awe and danger. The mystical side of the beliefs of the Clan is interesting and adds an additional layer to the characters. What robbed the book for me was that it suffers from 'Chosen One' syndrome. While the main character, Ayla, is a really sympathetic and interesting character. She does suffer from loss and setbacks, but it felt that every other chapter was her bucking the system and sticking it to the man. While it was inspiring and made me root for her, after a while it became expected. I love stories of people changing their society by challenging norms, but I'm surprised this prehistoric character didn't invent writing, gunpowder, and architecture. I don't plan on reading the rest of the series. "
1296,59190218,did not like it,"The story is basically about a people in prehistoric time; the first in a series of six books. This is where the main character at only 5 is orphaned due to a huge earthquake. The author goes into a lot of detail into the prehistoric animals and plants and the ways of prehistoric peoples. The story is good and interesting to read. But they think and talk like 21st century people in a prehistoric settle. I don't think that is very realistic. But that is not why I gave it only one star. I cannot recommend a book that is porno in nature. The author is very into graphic sex (even for the animals)and it is a total turn off to me. And bringing 21st issues of ""the pill"" into the story only they use a plant brewed into tea. I guess you can skip the graphic sex and it is then a good read but I would not knowingly pay for a book with this sort of crude in it. To me the author has prostituted herself in order to sell her book. I have put her on my ""Do not read this author"" list."
1296,2143295,really liked it,"Ayla is an outsider among the clan. Found and adopted by the medicine woman of the clan during their migration, Ayla finds herself the target of an ambitious man hoping to become leader, training to be a medicine woman in her own right in hopes of earning some status within the caste, and challenging the set gender roles of her adopted culture.I was impressed by Auel's research on flora and fauna. The first time I read this I was in seventh grade and stuck home convalescing from an injury. I had read everything I owned and found this in my mother's room. The home-study program that I was forced into because of a lack of wheelchair accessibility facilities at my middle school was impressed that I had not only read it but could speak on a variety of themes I found in it. They moved me to the senior English class."
1296,1328218993,really liked it,"This book is easily 4.5 *'s.First thing's first, I FINISHED THIS BOOK! I'm so proud. Ok, moving on... I really really enjoyed the story of Ayla as she grows up and learns to live with, and within the rules of, the Clan of the Cave Bear. I loved most of the members of the clan, especially Isa & Kreb, but even the interactions with the antagonist (I have no idea how to spell his name, you know who I mean) helped to round out all the characters and elucidate the nuances of the Clan's structure/heirarchy. All the differences/similarities between Clan and the Others as observed by Ayla vs Clan people made the overall story especially interesting. My main complaint here is about the audio version. I really disliked the way that each chapter/section ran into each other. A breath by the narrator or a few seconds silence in the recording would have helped a LOT, IMHO."
1296,1187791523,really liked it,"I heard someone recommend this book because of the descriptive food scenes in it. The story is set in prehistoric times, so all the food is hunted and gathered which does make for very tantalizing food scenes. As a historical novel, this book does a really good job of describing life in prehistoric times as well as drawing you in through the story. She gives you a good description of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon humans that was very interesting.Ayla, the protagonist, is a kick butt female role model to any girls or women reading the series. At times the actions of the antagonist got a little repetitive and annoying but I understand why Auel did this. Overall, I really enjoyed reading The Clan of the Cave Bear. This book has also really made me want to learn about foraging and herbal medicine, just a heads up. "
1296,773573847,liked it,"I read it because someone I know told me it was her favorite book from her youth. Although I enjoyed reading it, I couldn't help feeling its' undertones of white supremacy. Ayla is considered to be Big&Ugly, but she is actually beautiful with long straight legs. She is much, much smarter than Short&Dark Clan people. I know Auel wanted to display the difference between Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, but does Ayla have to be tall, Golden hair, and blue eyed? About 45,000 years ago, when they co-existed, as far as I know it was not common for Cro-Magnon to have light colored eyes. It started as mutation. To portray as tall white human as superior to short stocky brown eyed sub-human seems to me quite insulting because it gives American young readers that impression. I was uncomfortable in the beginning, but when I started to read #2 of Earth's Children, it became disturbing. "
1296,545179980,it was amazing,"Hooked from page one, I enjoyed the entire exotic, exciting, and unpredictable ride with The Clan. Few books have stayed with me in vivid detail like this one. Auel's painstaking re-creation of this inter-evolutionary time, with an unlikely female heroine at its heart, was visionary for its time, and holds its magic even today - perhaps more so, the further we travel into the digital age. While the magic diminishes with each sequel, they all warrant a read if you must know what happens next - at least read Plains of Passage. However, I must admit that after two attempts, I am unable to get through the final book of the series, released two years ago. Even so, this has not dampened my enthusiasm for The Clan of the Cave Bear. Immensely satisfying, this remains one of the few books I recommend to everyone! "
1296,61449844,did not like it,"It's been many years since I've read this book but I remember it as being rather lame. It was like any other romance novel only it happen to be set in pre-historic times. The characters are purely good or completely bad, with a stereotypical heroine, like most stories of this genre. I realize many women like books like this as I think they like to fantasize that they are the incredibly beautiful but deeply misunderstood heroine. I also think the book is somewhat racist as the intelligent heroine is light skinned and blonde while the ""bad"" people are dark and stupid. No offense meant to those who liked it. Romance, or ""fluff"" books as I call them, have never been books that I enjoyed and this one in particular I really thought was a bunch of rubbish. "
1296,822946958,it was amazing,"Primero que nada. Leí este libro porque fue un regalo, realmente no se si de haberlo visto lo hubiera comprado, lo hubiera leído pero... ¡menos mal llego a mi! que historia mas hermosa, profunda, interesante. EL solo hecho de ser contada desde un tiempo mucho mas antiguo de lo que alguna vez pude recordar, es increíble. Te abre la mente a una realidad de como fue el mundo antes, cuando eramos apenas una especie que surgía.Los lazos de amistad y amor, y familia, al igual que el odio son descritos en este libro de una manera única, no creo que exista mejor libro para empezar este año. ¡excelente!Ilya, gracias, muchas gracias por este hermoso regalo mi amor. ¡ahora quiero el segundo eh!"
1296,1659522375,liked it,"hmm,What to say about this one.Well first off I did like it and please don't get confused by the title as it is not great.The story is good and I enjoyed the read very much.I usually don't explain the story in my reviews but maybe I will have to in this case.The main female characters coming of age and survival in the hard world that she lives.It has some very interesting situations and interactions between two human species living on the planet at the same time.I did not like everything and that is why only the 3 stars but 3.5 is not out of the question as the 2nd and third books are equal as interesting Sadly the last two are not so good :("
1296,375820421,it was amazing,"Historical fiction is a genre I try to avoid as much as I can. It's just not my cup of tea. This book was different. I wanted to read it and see whether I'd like it or not. It took three pages, then I knew I was gonna love this book. Even though this is a pretty long book, it was a pleasure reading it. I'm so glad I decided to pick it up. I had to get used to the writing, because it did have some very long and describing parts, but when I got through them, it was all good. There were a lot of characters and I had a bit of a hard time keeping track of all of them. Uba, Iza and Broud - I liked all of them. I know you're supposed to dislike Broud, but for whatever reason, I didn't. "
1296,339682328,liked it,"Read this in my freshman year of high school and found it to be fun and captivating. Despite knowing, even at the time, that it was far from perfect, and that Ayla is something of a 'Mary Sue', she is hardly the real character of the story. It's the world, its overall cast of people, mythos, and practices, that occupies the foreground here. It is palpable and vivid, highly energetic. The rest of the books are not as good, but that doesn't matter. This is a standalone. Of course I saw the 1986 move with Daryl Hannah before reading it though, ha."
1296,871815278,really liked it,"I read some reviews that said some negative things about this book. I, however, really liked it. The only part that bugged me was the five or so pages about stone tool making. I just could not convince myself to care.The major characters go through good amounts of character growth, the story-line flows very well, and it brought me to tears at the end, a feat not many books can accomplish. It's not perfect, and I don't know that I want to read more from the series, but I am happy to have read this one."
1296,1757802639,it was amazing,"Extraordinarily sensual, perspective and perceptual storytelling. The young Cro-Magnon Ayla, faces hardships, trials and tribulations, being reminiscent of destiny's determination to plummet her, into depressive defeat. I found myself quickly indulged in the meticulously described environment, making fictional attachments to certain clan-members (Creb and Iza, #neverforget) and being sympathetically swayed, by the easily lovable characteristics of Ayla, and watching her develop throughout hindrances, as well as celebrations. "
1296,131816344,it was amazing,"The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. AuelThe clash of civilizations, one ancient and a new and upcoming race of men is embodied in a deceptively simple tale. The story of a young child rescued by a troop of Clan members driven from their home by the same earthquake that stripped the girl child of her home and hearth. Simple charity driven by love and a nurturing soul bring the girl of the Others into the Clan's home. A Mother's love, striving for acceptance, jealousy and hate come together to weave this gripping tale of survival. Recommended."
1296,360107964,really liked it,"This is a wonderful storytelling, giving us an educated glimpse of what early Homo sapiens and Neanderthal could have been liked. Of the six books in this series this one and the next, are the strongest of the series. There is so much great research that has gone into these books, that that in itself is a wonderful. Not just research of early humans but how the earth was like in that age of time. "
1296,162979105,liked it,"For some reason I couldn’t define, the recent election made me want to revisit this book, which I first read about twenty years ago. Now that I’ve finished it, I think I understand why I felt pulled to read it again. I think something in my subconscious knew that I really needed a story about a brave, resilient, resourceful, brilliant woman who triumphs over a venal little man ruled by his fragile ego. "
1296,2451743585,liked it,I have no idea how to rate this book...I just read a 500+ word books in a sitting (an afternoon in fact) and it was so unlike anything I've read recently...Stars could change!
1296,2526151178,it was ok,"Not even going to write a review for this piece of unadulterated twaddle that was superhyped into a runaway bestseller. It's all been said by another reviewer here on Goodreads, so this is all I need to say:Click this...[blows sound of ripe raspberry in Ms. Auel's general direction, and goes out for tea...]"
1296,1805817156,really liked it,"I first read this book as a young teenager and I remember liking it, but then I didn't fully appreciate the research and attention to detail the author put into this. While we will never know details of early human day-to-day life, Auel does a good job of describing what it could have been like, based on what we know from anthropological and archeological research. She also wraps her pre-historical world in an interesting tale of personal interactions and experiences."
1296,25343846,really liked it,"Okay, seriously. What the hell was I thinking, reading these books at an impressionable age? Like The Godfather, this is a book I didn't know I didn't want to read until I was several sequels in. I still regard this book with an inexplicable fondness (note the four stars!), despite having learned the concepts of ""Mary Sue"" and ""what a pointless and poorly-done sex scene"" in the intervening years."
1296,13114451,did not like it,"This book was recommended to me as a good resource for learning primative skills. I'd have to strongly disagree with that. There were a few medicinal plants mentioned but you have to slog through hundreds of pages of lame story-telling to find them. The book gave a very idealized veiw of the lives of cavemen. Everything was milk and honey and wonderful rather than brutish, ugly and short. "
1296,1366179011,really liked it,Ohhh-M-Geeee!!! This book was so good! The tensions between Ayla and Broud geesh. I just can't even explain in words how much I loved this book. I'm going to buy the rest of the series ASAP!!! Thank you for recommending this book...it's the second book recommended to me by my coworker that has been awesome! And to think this came out 1980 and I never heard of it until this year! Insane!!! 
1296,680385314,really liked it,"Despite some odd pacing, especially towards the end, this was a deeply entertaining and meticulously researched novel. Ayla is the very definition of a Mary Sue - although she gets way worse in future novels - but she is certainly a character you can follow and appreciate. "
1296,22228749,did not like it,Terrible book! I have no idea how it became so popular. The writing style is awful and the storyline is weak. I only read it (and am reading the next in the series) so that I can give it away with a clear conscience. 
1296,171397027,it was amazing,Recommended to me by my high school English teacher. Read it and loved it. Was and still is one of my favorite books. I think it's time for a reread!
1296,61733764,really liked it,Must read again after visiting Lascaux.
1296,1551335934,liked it,"A very good book, with interesting characters and a fantastic plot. It's a great book to read if you love historical fiction novels. "
1296,542151435,really liked it,"Some parts were just boring, all the descriptions of forests and so - so the beginning really wasn't amazing. But for the rest of the book, the main character completely changed my mind: I loved her!"
1296,375603983,it was amazing, A great adult read but the movie sucked. Not realy my cup of tea now days but I loved it when it was first writen and read it about 5 times.

1296,692946480,it was amazing,Interesting. 4.5 stars. 
1296,2018122526,it was amazing,"My fascination with this book is somewhat random. Growing up, this was a popular enough book that I'd see it for sale at numerous used book stores, and always kept it in the back of my mind that I would read it someday. No particular reason why besides a title that implied there'd be some people that had some involvement with bears. I never bought it as a kid though, who knows why when I picked up so many other books that have sat on my shelves for years and either been read or are still waiting for the long payoff. When my wife was looking for a book about a primitive culture I looked this one up (really never even knowing what it was about for sure until then) and got a copy for both of us. While she's reading the excellent Crime and Punishment I thought I'd zip through this one before she got to it. That's a long buildup before ever discussing this book, but I'm wanting to be honest in discussing my thoughts as I read this.First, I'm giving this book five stars. I give a lot of books I enjoy five stars, but they're generally books I enjoyed and lived up to what I was hoping for, or took a series that was good and made it better. This was one of those rare books that made me wish I'd be a bit pickier with my five star ratings as I enjoyed this book a lot more than many other books I've given five stars to. I'd say it's on par with Nick Hornby's Ten Years in the Tub for the best book I've read in the past few years.However, I could see how this book would not be for everyone. Auel has a writing style here that I LOVED. It was very simple to follow, heavily based on advancing the narrative. However, Auel also has a habit for interjecting a modern reader's sensibility into the story, discussing things like advanced medical science, or biology of the neanderthal brain. I could see how some readers will be taken out of the story by this, but I appreciated the interjections as a good narrator explaining the inner goings of the characters and the society they inhabit. The group of neanderthal (Clan) people also have some abilities that are rooted in fantasy, but the book tries to stay as grounded as possible in reality. While that mixture of modern science with fantasy abilities all taking place in a historical fiction type of narrative is unlike anything I've read, Auel (for this book at least) managed to bring it all together in an exemplary manner.Clan of the Cave Bear  features a small cast of about 20 characters, of which five are significantly developed and about another five are treated as important but also fairly static (along with the other ten or so characters). Ayla is the protagonist, a Cro-Magnon girl who gets adopted by the neanderthal tribe. Iza is the medicine woman who adopts her, Creb is the shaman type character for the clan, Brun is the tribe leader and Broud is his son and in line to be the next leader. I found myself loving four of these characters and hating the fifth, which I expect will be the same reaction for most who read this book.I can see by the average Goodreads scores, that most people find the quality of this series to be of diminishing returns as it advances. I'm tempted to forego reading more of the series and just enjoying what a great book this is on its own. However, I already know I'll be tracking down at least the next book as this one ends on enough of an open ending that I'd like to see what happens to the characters that are still alive from the group above, as well as the offspring of those characters. "
1296,1998267054,liked it,"So my ACTUAL feelings about this book are ""it was okay I guess,"" but it was advertised to me as soothing explanations of nature things, and I am happy to report, all of this is true! That being said: Auel explains in her notes that she spent an immense amount of time doing research for this, and I'm sure that's true, but the repeated assertion that Neanderthals were intensely patriarchal just feels very uncreative to me. Like I don't know anything about the research she did, but I don't think the Neanderthals had any idea of gender--and it would be more interesting that they did.I also wasn't warned there were rape sequences in this book, so I want to make sure I say they exist. It felt very ""what the fuck why is this in this book"" (like what in her research made her go ""hm I guess rape exists in this universe""--although maybe she was like ""hm since they're Very Patriarchal that seems like a thing."") I guess what bothers me about these things is they don't come off as creative or interesting choices, and it posits humanity as this group that is like ""better"" because they're presumably less patriarchal and like not quite ma'am! BUT, as I said: the descriptions of herb-gathering and hide-preparation was all very soothing, so if you're down with that and can ignore the weird gender stuff going on in this book, it may be really interesting to you! "
1296,2159392606,really liked it,"I read The Valley of the Horses when I was about 15. I liked it and after finding The Clan of the Cave Bear at a used book sale, I decided to try and read the series.This book took me three months to read despite all my best efforts. I REALLY liked it but it was also very detailed and there were times when I just didn't want to read an in-depth description of the skinning of an animal or the various plants collected. I either skimmed or I took breaks and read a different book intermittently.The other thing I really struggled with is remembering the ages of the characters. It's VERY realistic and follows everything that anthropologists have discovered (as of the time of publishing). Therefore, the characters are WAY younger than the narration makes them seem. There were times when I was thinking about the age, thought someone was x number of years, and then read a few pages further to be told I was off by a decade or two.Over all, I really liked it. It's a true historical fiction that closely aligns with fact. "
1296,2412379491,liked it,"This was an interesting read. Interesting in a good way, not bad. The concept of a story surrounding the lives of cavemen right after the ice age (I think that was the timeline), is different and not one I thought I would find very interesting. I was pleasently surprised however by the ease of Auel's writing style and although it was long, I fell right into the story and wanted to see how it would end. The characters were easy to like, except Broud, I couldn't stand that guy but that might have been the point. My favorite by far was Ayla, she was strong willed and followed her own path (or at least tried to several times) because she was not like the Cave Bear Clan, she was one of the Others. The contrast between thier two worlds was refreshing and I absolutly loved the revelation Creb has in the end about the future of the two type of people. I will say that there were intense times throughout the book where I wasn't sure I wanted to be reading what was written, but these scenes didn't last too long. The ending was not my favorite and although I realize this is a series, I wish the author hadn't left things they way she did at the end of this story. I might pick up the next book because I'm curious to see how everything plays out. This isn't a book that I would normally pick up and read, but I'm glad I did!"
1296,1664209814,it was amazing,"This is my new favorite book! Jean Auel paints picture after detailed picture of her Ice Age setting using mostly prosaic language and all 1,000 words each picture is worth. I have never gotten so immersed in a book, or as attached to the characters, as this. It's a slow build to some very powerful moments and ideas that I know will stick with me for a long time.I haven't cried at a book since Where the Red Fern Grows or Wringer (Jerry Spinelli, 1996, 1 star, and mostly because someone (lookin' at you, Mom and Dad) forced me to speak aloud the name of the book I hated so much for the fact that it's about kids breaking pigeons' necks), but I came close a couple of times near the end.I can see the book not being for everyone. The writing style sometimes edges on clunky. One page in particular lists just about every species of mammal living in the vicinity of the protagonist's cave, listing ""red deer, known to some people as elk... and elk, called moose by those who know red deer as elk,"" culminating with a single sentence listing about 30 smaller species that were not given their own paragraphs. By the second half, though, I had a hard time putting the book down.I don't think I'll read the sequels, I'd rather not know what happens next.If you like prehistoric fiction, also read Jack London's Before Adam!"

1296,969723547,really liked it,"Een mooi geschreven verhaal over de avonturen van het meisje Ayla dat opgenomen wordt in een Neanderthaler stam. Auel beschrijft de leefwijze van de stam heel mooi. Hoe ze omgaan met alles wat de natuur te bieden heeft en de diepgewortelde angst voor de totemgeesten. Het blijft natuurlijk fictie, maar ik vind dat Auel een realistische mogelijke leefwijze van de Neanderthaler weet neer te zetten. Het hele verhaal van de herinneringen die gdnetisch worden doorgegeven slaat wetenschappelijk gezien natuurlijk nergens op, maar ik vond het niet storend. Wat me wel stoorde was de jomge leeftijd waarop de meisjes 'vrouw worden'. 7 jaar is gewoon te jong en het idee dat een 8 jarig kind al kinderen krijgt vind ik geen prettig lezen. Het feit dat Ayla pas 10 jaar is tijdens de beruchte scene met Ayla en Broud voelde erg ongemakkelijk. Ik hield altijd het beeld in mijn hoofd dat ze rond de 15/16 was en dat las een stuk fijner.Ik heb erg meegeleefd met Ayla, Iza, Creb en Brun tijdens het verhaal. Ik ga de vervolgen toch links liggen, want die zijn nog dikker dan dit boek. "
1296,1980036394,it was amazing,"I wasn't sure I would be able to read this seemingly immense first book of a series. A dear friend leant me her copies of I believe the first four (and the hardcovers occupied a formidable portion of a shelf). Once I got started it was comforting to know the next book was within sight and reach. The books were very different than anything I'm drawn to, but these stories absolutely hooked me in. The characters became real.Their experiences were so vividly described you felt as if you were sitting on their shoulders with each of them. Each step along the way to fight for survival, you read of strength, fear, confusion, adaptation, constant challenges, learning, love, companionship and adventure. An excellent first book and lead into subsequent volumes. I highly recommend the Jean Aurel books. I plan to re read them, which I seldom do."
1296,2020501671,it was ok,"While I read a lot of books on history, I’m not often a reader of historical fiction. So, reading pre-historic fiction was a new one for me. Modern humans meet Neanderthals in Jean Auel’s Clan of the Cave Bear. It follows young human Ayla as she is left orphaned by an earthquake and injured by a cave lion. The Neanderthal Clan of Cave Bear takes her in and raises her as one of their own, despite some hesitation and dissent within the group. Ayla’s connection with the clan’s powerful magician and medicine woman endures her status in the group even as her outsider origins and physical and mental differences continually cause friction with other members of the clan. Supposedly this novel is well researched, but there’s clearly a lot of literary license taken as so little is known about pre-historic life. Auel does a good job of making the characters relatable, but there is little depth to them and only Ayla has even a whiff of character development. Before picking this up, I was told it would also have some trashy Neanderthal romance components, but unfortunately those apparently only start up in the second book of the series. This is a multi-book series, but I won’t be continuing, cave romance or not."
1296,514470510,it was amazing,"Es uno de mis libros favoritos. Lo he leído al menos tres veces: la primera, cuando lo compré, la segunda cuando conseguí los pdf de los 4 que continuaban (antes de que saliera el sexto) y la tercera, este año cuando ingresé a un grupo de whatsapp donde se lee la saga a la que pertenece.Es una historia muy interesante y entretenida, aunque a algunos a los que se lo he recomendado lo encuentran demasiado descriptivo, y lo es. La historia de Ayla y de su proceso de adaptación al clan de neandertales es maravillosa. Se describen muchas costumbres y características asociadas a ellos que difieren de la niña (y de nosotros). Es un excelente texto para introducirnos en la vida prehistórica. Según la clasificación de novelas, éste sería una novela de ambientación histórica.De los que le siguen en la saga (""Los hijos de la Tierra""), los dos siguientes son muy buenos también (El valle de los caballos y Los cazadores de mamuts).Totalmente recomendado."
1296,2279556105,it was amazing,"Listened to the audio.I've read this book a couple of times, along with other books in the series. This is the strongest book of the series by far because of Auel's ability to create a realistic depiction of Neanderthals and the possible differences they had from modern humans. There is great character development of the main protagonist (Ayla) who despite the bonds of unchanging society about her, cannot deny her own heritage. But what was most interesting for me was the way in which she describes Neanderthals and how their brains work differently with the fullest expression of instinct as part of what they called memories.Highly recommended. Very nice speculative fiction."
1296,2441565557,really liked it,"I saw the film with my father when I was ten and read the book for the first time when I was 14 or 15. I think the film and the novel had fused together in my memory, and it was fun to go back and reread it more than 20 years later. I still enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as I did when I was a teenager. Parts of it read like YA fiction but the story was still entertaining. I haven't read the rest of the series but I'll certainly request book two from the library! I am curious to see how 11 year old Ayla fairs."
1296,2398084585,it was amazing,"Книга про девочку-кроманьонку, которую воспитывал клан неандертальцев. Невероятно интересный сюжет про времена, когда человеку приходилось выживать на грани своих возможностей, когда не было понятия ""семья"", но был ""клан"", когда любое врачевание воспринималось как магия, а беременности наступали, когда покровитель женщины проигрывал битву... Было это так или нет, мы не знаем. Но фантазии Джин Ауэл про события 30000-летней давности впечатляют. На сегодня мы единственные в своем роде на Земле, и очень тяжело представить, как жили бок о бок два разных вида человека в прежние времена. "
1296,2064107305,it was amazing,"I loved this book! However, I'm very happy that I waited 'til now to read it because of the rape scene. Though I could sense it was coming, for those who are closer to their attack it would probably be triggering. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the central characters and wanted to know what happened next so much that I checked out the next book in the series and consumed it in nothing flat! "
1296,2704306661,really liked it,"4.5 This is book 4 completed from the Great American Read list. All the feels! I really enjoyed it, but found the rape too much to bear. I loved that this coming of age story is of a young woman and walks alongside her through childhood, young adulthood and motherhood. Very interesting perspectives on the life and times of the first humans."
1296,2612950794,really liked it,"I don't need to know every mammal that used a foot path or every single tree species in a forest - some descriptions went on a bit too long for me. A thrilling, energetic read. When you think the pace for the characters/family is about to slow, there are unexpected rumblings on personal, Clan, and environmental levels."
1296,1076593622,really liked it,"The Clan of the Cave Bear is a non fiction book in disguise as historical fiction. Jean M. Auel gives you a multitude of details about the lives of the clan, everything from how they gathered food, made implements and took mates, to their spiritual beliefs, secret man ceremonies and how the medicine women worked.Auel spent many years researching the details in her Earth’s Children series to bring the most up to date and informative knowledge about how Neanderthal’s lived and survived. There were a few facts relating to their brain size, and past life memories which I’m skeptical on (Reminds me of Aang being able to talk to past Avatar’s in The Last Airbender – different concept though). But for the sake of storytelling it adds to the mystery and intrigue of this different species who are closely related to humans.There are three main characters in the novel; Ayla, Iza and Creb. All of which are featured in the blurb. *gasps* I haven’t written my usual blurb bash. Shocking right?! But for once they have hit the nail straight on the head. Possibly because my edition was published thirty years after the original publication date, and they had time to get it right. My mum might have an original or close to original copy of it. She’s got the one with Ayla on the front.The Clan of the Cave Bear cover 2Clicking on the cover will take you to Jean M. Auel’s site where you can read all about the entire Earth’s Children series. Clicking on the cover at the top next to my rating will take you to the Goodreads site where you can read reviews by other members.I don’t have any issues with the blurb on my edition. I like the way it says Iza and Creb’s titles before their names. Tip for any writers writing a blurb or something like it: if you have to mention lots of characters call them by their titles only. Policeman, Mother, Teacher, Boyfriend, Best friend. Names are great, but it’s hard to keep track of them and remember who they are and why we should remember them. Titles make it simpler until the reader delves into the story.Back to the review!The Clan of the Cave Bear follows Ayla’s life as she grows from a little girl into a young women. One of the things I loved about this book was by the end pages you actually feel as if Ayla has grown up. Her thoughts, actions, emotions, and words, have matured from five to…um…I think she’s fourteen maybe?When I said young women I didn’t mean teenager. By the end of the book Ayla is by no means a teenager anymore. Because Neanderthals only lived to around thirty (according to recent findings. I am definitely not a science wizard) fourteen is almost middle aged. She might even be younger, at the end of the novel she could be anywhere between ten and sixteen. In our species I’d think of Ayla as anywhere between eighteen and late twenties.Okay that is a weird end sentence. Ayla is our species. How about I say, in our day and age expediency she’d be between eighteen and late twenties. Again that is how I perceive it. Auel doesn’t actually state to you how old Ayla is. Occasionally during the front half of the novel she’d say an age to help you gauge, but by the end of it she just uses significant events in a female’s life to give the readers an idea of Ayla’s maturity.The book opened by eyes to many things like the age perceptions I wrote above. It also made me think differently about Neanderthals. I always pictured them as these large scary beings. When in actual fact they are shorter than humans. It was quite an eye opener when Ayla is described as taller than all the men. I’d probably fit in right at home with their size ;PAs you can tell by the rating I loved The Clan of the Cave Bear. I’ll definitely be reading The Valley of the Horses. I just read the blurb on Auel’s page and I’m super keen! I love horses :) But unfortunately I don’t know when that will be since my TBR pile is giant.Auel’s storytelling is engaging. There was rarely a time when I found my eyes slipping from the page. Although it took me longer to read this book than most it wasn’t by choice. I had other commitments. I guess that tells you it wasn’t an I-can’t-put-down-this-insane-amazing-book, but I did love reading it. It reminds me of the feeling I get with Mary Grant Bruce’s Billabong series. I could sink into it and feel peaceful. It was definitely a book that lived up to reading reducing my stress levels by 68%reducing stress levels You guys are all my friends, I recommend this book to you. No book is for everyone of course. Historical fiction fans should like it, and if it’s not your cup of tea it never hurts to read outside your comfort zone. So in other words read it :PIf I didn’t I wouldn’t have found another four star book!Talk to you guys on Sunday, if not sooner! I’m off to do some more Tafe and maybe start the second last Skulduggery, Last Stand of Dead Men. The end of one of my favourite series is in sight! I’m sad, but also very interested to see how Derek Landy ties this up.Which favourite series have you finished this year?

1296,2381476065,it was amazing,"Very engaging protagonist and characters. Great setting - the time when more than one type of human walked the earth. So interesting, every though research has moved on a little and we know much more.Still those annoying fantasy tropes though - rape and torture; at least not dwelt on with every detail and sensation described."
1296,2719812080,it was ok,"Кромањонска дјевојчица одгојена у племену неандерталаца и њено пробијање кроз живот. Увијек занимљива тема сусрета двије различите културе, расе, обичаја… Занимљива за опуштено читање, без нарочитог дубоког размишљања. Обилује антагонизмима, па ако је читач цјепидлака сигурно ће их све примијетити и неће му се свидјети. Ако сте за штиво које ће вас само забавити, онда је прилично добра."
1296,2440012449,liked it,"That's it??? After all that, this is how it ends? Ugh. While I really enjoyed the story, I had some major problems with this book. I don't know if I can continue the series because the writing was so frustrating, but I want to know what happens! I'm not even going to list all of my issues - there are just too many, but the last quarter of the book almost made me forget them because it got so much better. Too little, too late."
1296,2457667917,it was amazing,"An engrossing, phenomenal read! I fell in love with the characters immediately, and was completely captivated by Auel's descriptive and evocative storytelling. I read this book as part of the PBS 100 Great American Reads, but now can't wait to read more from the series!"
1296,2091900768,,DNF'd at page 122. I was reading it for class but it's not one of my compulsory readings and I just have way too much to read right now. I was enjoying the book though and I may pick it up again at some point.
1296,1997699323,it was amazing,"Read many years ago this book encouraged me in a lifetime interest in anthropology, pre-history, evolution and human origins. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it again in light of new discoveries since it's publication relating to Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal.."
1296,689762982,liked it,"First, I should mention that historical fiction is not a genre I typically seek out. Much like travelogue fantasy, it seeks to continually remind the reader that life in the yesterday and/or camping is hard and gross and generally inconvenient, which I am aware of and have no desire to read about. If, therefore, you are asking yourself why I would read this, it's because it has been in my TBR pile for several years as a result of an impulse buy at Barnes & Noble - as so many of my TBR pile is.The plot was compelling enough to keep me interested, although I liberally skimmed some sections where the author fell into exhaustive detail about medicinal plants, cleaning and dressing an animal carcass, etc. The pace is relentlessly slow, as the main action is frequently interrupted by long dissertations about plants and animals. It's obvious that the author did a lot of research and has a great depth of knowledge about this period, but half the book read like an anthropological textbook rather than a work of fiction. Since I don't care about those topics, it was only mild curiosity about the MC that kept me going.Five-year-old Ayla's family dies in an earthquake, and she's alone and wandering in the Ice Age wilderness until she is taken in by the Clan. The Clan is a more primitive species of mankind described as having large brains but no capacity to adapt or change. Ayla is ""Other,"" so her body is shaped differently, her eyes are blue, her brain processes abstract concepts at age 5 that her guardian Creb still struggles with in his sixties, and she's capable of crying, smiling and laughing which the clan doesn't/can't do. Because of various events, the Clan considers Ayla lucky, although most of those events were really just Ayla using the analytical parts of her brain that they lack. Jealous of the attention her luck and intelligence bring her, the Clan leader's son beats Ayla often, even raping her later in the novel, although it's not considered rape in this society.Ayla and her transformation during this book are the only reason I kept going. She's very young when they find her, and as she grows and develops, it's very apparent that she's different from her ""family."" She's taller, leaner, and infinitely more intelligent. She's also unwilling to be forced into the traditional role of women as meek, mild food preparers who aren't allowed to use weapons or resist the sexual advances of men. Auel sets up the reader to sympathize and relate to Ayla, telling us that she's a homo sapien and her brain is much like our own. It does, however, give the author an ""out."" Every time the character encounters trouble, her smarter brain finds a way out. She can kill any animal, find food, seek shelter, etc even though none of the Clan can, because of her smart brain. Maybe it's my exposure to five-year-olds in first world countries or just my cynicism, but Ayla reads like a teenager at age seven and an adult at age fourteen. Sure, I can appreciate that their life cycles are shorter in the Ice Age but I'm pretty sure your average seven-year-old can't fight off hyenas and live alone for a month in the wild.The author seemed torn between a strict historical fiction novel or one with a touch of fantasy. If the women get pregnant by inhaling the man's totem [spirit] through their mouths and then his totem overwhelms theirs, then that would suggest sex plays no part in impregnation. However, the clan leader makes the men and women sleep separately while they're looking for a new cave because he doesn't want any of the women to get pregnant while they're traveling. They still walk together and eat together and communicate so by their breathing-spirit theory, the women could still get pregnant. The Clan also claims that medicine women and their spiritual leader have access to the memories of their predecessors because of their large brains, which is magic and not an evolutionary trait. This GoodReads review had some particularly good criticism.The inconsistent use of language and advanced vocabulary was slightly irritating and took me out of the story a couple of times. They use words like ""human"" and ""nerve ending"" in their dialogue which are too scientific for the setting. Their culture's language is based primarily on hand gestures, so it's considered rude to stare while people are conversing. The author adjusts most of the dialogue because it would be intolerable to read an entire 500 page novel full of sentences like, ""Bad. Not stare. Not like. You bad."" Yet some conversations were conducted in that broken, two or three word structure, which was difficult to read. The author is not consistent with one or the other style, using both interchangeably, which frustrated me.The Clan of the Cave Bear was fine, but it's not a book I'm ever likely to revisit. It was enjoyable despite my problems with it, and anyone who likes historical fiction or has an interest in Ice Age plants or animals may enjoy this book.The review ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" appeared first on StarlightBookReviews.com."

1296,2138081484,it was ok,"I read this on the insistence of a friend. I really struggled to get into the book, and I almost put it down at several points. Although things got much better once I got past the first 1/3, the writing dragged for me throughout as I found this book to be overly descriptive. Having said that, the setting, characters, underlying themes, and story concept were great. Sadly, I think the true potential of the story was lost because of the unnecessary detail and lethargic writing. Though I greatly appreciate all the research that went into writing this book, it could have done without 50% of the detail and description it contained."

1296,2549000421,liked it,"Good Story, but......There was too much violence and sex in this story. I know there has to be an antagonist in the story, but there didn’t need to be the graphic rape scene in the story to make it good. "

1296,2586162613,liked it,"My interest was piqued when I saw that this was ranked #38 on the Great American Read top 100 list. I wouldn’t put it my top 100, but it was better than you might expect for a novel about Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals. I enjoyed it, but not enough to continue the series."
1296,284199589,liked it,"Ayla is found by a stream aged five, picked up by the great medicine woman Iza, and is accepted into the close-knit Clan. Her totem is none less that the great Cave Lion. As she grows up, she learns Clan ways, and becomes a Clan woman. Despite this, she can't shake the hatred of Broud, son of the leader's mate, who can't wait to get rid of her.It starts off slowly. The first five pages in which we only hear of ""the naked girl"" is incredibly tedious. Then when she is found, Iza's unwillingness to leave the child is completely uncharacteristic to every other time Iza speaks. Women cannot speak out against any man without punishment, there are rules with which a woman can speak to a man. Iza does not adhere to any of these.So, a bad start.I keep reading and I like the way in which Auel documents Ayla's growing up and slow acceptance into the clan. Her love for Creb, contrasted with the rest of the Clan's fear is a good way to show differences between Clan/Others. It's also a good way of showing Brun's acceptance along with Broud's hatred. Now I think back to it, I see why the slow-burning of Ayla's growing up was necessary. However while reading I found it dull.Then (view spoiler)[Ayla hunts. (hide spoiler)]It's quite easy to see the motivation behind it. It seems like it was inevitable to happen, and I half expected her to get too big for her boots and parade her talent around. It was nice to have to wait until the Mammoth Hunt. Also, the circumstances in which her talent is revealed is a good reflection of Iza's first meeting of Ayla.But then the next bit is a tad predictable. Half the Clan hates it! The other half are willing to sweep it under the carpet! It is up to the wise leader to decide!Considering five more books attach onto the one I was half-way through reading, it was basic common sense that told me she would come through the other end of it unscathed.Then,(view spoiler)[ Broud takes a sudden interest in her and begins having sex with her on a regular basis.Giving you this fact alone, it's pretty obvious what the next major plot point is.Then, the baby is born ""deformed"". Or mixed-race, as we call it.More predicatble plot points follow.Ayla wants to keep the baby! This goes against Clan tradition! The fearless Ayla runs away!This is cute, and probably the most interest Ayla ever takes in her kid.Surprise surprise, Brun lets her keep the baby, Broud is shocked and hates her even more. (hide spoiler)]So, after the incredibly obvious plot point, the Clan Gathering happens.Once our attention is brought away from ohsoprecious Ayla and her ohsoprecious life, we discover they're just about to go away on a Clan Gathering. You'd think, as it happens only once every seven years, there'd be more of a build-up?Nope, we get a few milliseconds of ""Iza is too ill"", and then they're off, marching away.More predictable plot points(view spoiler)[The other clans aren't willing to accept Ayla! Creb and Brun have to win her support! Ayla meets a woman with a Clan/Other child! It happens to be a girl! Ayla's child shall have a mate after all! Ayla finds out some things that is forbidden for a woman to know! She gets away with it! (hide spoiler)]Considering the Clan Gathering is a BIG DEAL, you'd expect some more background information? The spotlight taken off ohsoprecious Ayla?Nope.They go home to a few more predictable plot points.(view spoiler)[ Iza dies! Ayla neglects her son and gets a fever that makes her milk dry up! Broud becomes leader! He fucks shit up! (hide spoiler)]Of course we knew the final one would happen, but within three milliseconds of the plot point before it? Really?Then ohsoprecious Ayla defies Broud (The shock! The spontinaity! The horror!) and gets clouted around the head, to be defended by Brun.Then the final part is just a big mess (big spoiler alert guys)(view spoiler)[An earthquake happens as Broud is demanding Ayla be cursed. Creb dies. Broud's leadership is challenged. Ayla suddenly take a conviently large interest in her son again, after he spends a lot of his time just being a plot point, and tries to save him by running into the cave. She screams ""Motherr!"" as a throwback to her Others days. Ayla is cursed, and leaves the Clan and son behind (hide spoiler)]I had to trawl through hundreds of pages for two pages of THAT? I get that action scenes are meant to be fast-paced, but that much plot squeezed into so few words deserves some kind of medal. It gets to the point in which it's not fast-paced, but just a big jumble of mess. 3/5Auel can present good character development, but needs to work on plot spacing and side character development."
1296,2393179209,,Heard about this book from the Great American Read 100 booklist. Listened to it on audio. Didn't realize it was part of a series. I enjoyed it and hope to check out the others. 
1296,2514158482,really liked it,I enjoyed it more than I thought i would! sometimes my eyes glazed over with long descriptive passages though i will say that Jean Auel certainly has a talent for them. The book was impressively researched; it really stoked my curiosity for knowledge of prehistoric times and peoples. A page-turner!
1296,2231858644,did not like it,"Fronds, I found myself asking time after time, for the past several days, ""at what point do I just give up and not finish?"" I've only not-finished a book about 4 times. But then I read Guillermo Del Toro's highly inspirational quote on his favorite video games this morning: ""If it doesn't engage me, I leave it. I do not do homework with my life.""FOLKS. THIS. WAS. HOMEWORK.I remember seeing one of the sequels at a thrift store years ago and buying it because I thought it looked cool. Never read it. My manager mentioned Clan of the Cave Bear a few months ago when I mentioned I enjoyed reading fantasy, and I pretended like I'd read it. Then it went on sale in Audible's first-in-a-series sale, so I bought it.Yikes.This group of Neanderthals finds a lost little Cro Magnon girl in a storm and decide to raise her. They have an incredibly, horribly sexist society, explained as ""that's the way it's always been for millenia upon millenia."" First of all, that's fucked, because if there's one thing we know about cultures and history, it's that they adapt and change and evolve.Secondly, this book has a horrible problem with deciding how it wants to tell the story. It'll start talking in third-person with the characters, and then suddenly we're switching to omniscient encyclopedia voice as a faceless narrator monotonously describes the science behind, say, astor plants, or a spear. It can never decide if it wants to be a narrative or a scientific journal. And that is especially bad; I could FEEL almost every single professor I've ever had cringing when I was listening to this book. The science is SO BAD. And there's not even the excuse of it being published in the 1980s; the Hobbit was published in 1937, and it's a more informed and nuance scientific text on the cultural differences between difference hominid species. Dwarves and their earthen love vs. hobbits who love their meals and staying at home? Oh, and there's always exceptions to each race there, too. The couple of Tooks that were adventurous, Bilbo, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, even Sam, goddammit. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are a much more fascinating anthropological series of texts than this hot garbage.So, Clan is not only narratively bad, it's scientifically bad.Then we have the protagonist. Ayla, who is ""blonde and blue-eyed,"" as opposed to the Neanderthals who are all darker. Racist undertones, much? I lost count of how many times it was stated that she has a much larger and more advanced frontal lobe and that's why she has the potential for brain intelligence. Literally, that is what it says. It's so bad. I'm not going to say that Neanderthals were grunting at each other and saying ""fire, bad! Boar, yum!"" but they weren't saying shit like that. No one says shit like that except for Jean M. fucking Auel.She is magically so good at everything. Invents the atlatl, bras, flint and fire, you fucking name it. It's too bad she never met Steve Jobs. She's such a magical savior; she is the iconic Neolithic Mary Sue.I've never read Rhapsody, but my friends have told me to read it, because of how bad it was. Apparently, the main character is such a Mary Sue that her beauty causes a cart accident (the horse equivalent of a car wreck, natch). Well, Ayla rivals that for sure. One of the villains has to beat her and assert his manhood because she is beautiful and always defying him. Oh, did I mention that the females are always disparaged because they can never accomplish as much as the men? Fuck that. I worked for two years at a fairly physically demanding job, and my friend, coworker, and all-around lovely human being Kaori and I were the best there. Even told so by several dudes who admitted they thought we wouldn't be able to pull our weight. I don't need to constantly listen to this garbage even in a dryly ""isn't this interesting because we know this to be wrong today case"" nofuckthatshit. Plus, that leads to all sorts of false stereotypes about historical sexism which interferes with modern-day progress. ""It's always been this way!"" noitfuckinghasntshutyourlyingmouththeadultsaretalkingIt's so obvious that Ayla is being developed to invent Neolithic feminism, but folks, I'm not going to stick around to see it. I'm not doing homework with this horse shit."
1296,2548585509,liked it,"This is the first in a series of Earth’s Children books set 30,000 years ago. Ayla, a 5 year old girl, is separated from her people (the Others) by an earthquake. She is found alone & near death by Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan of Cave Bear, a Neanderthal group. Iza takes Ayla under her wing and eventually adopts her as her daughter. The Clan members share memories and knowledge with others in their group without actually telling them to each other, but Ayla (not born with that Clan ability) learns many skills through observation. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a story of survival, acceptance, love and courage. I liked the story but I had difficulty preventing myself from skimming over the long descriptive passages about the setting. I dislike skimming, but this is a long book with many repetitive descriptions of the vegetation Ayla encounters on her root & plant gathering expeditions. This was one of the 100 books on the Great American Read, and it was an interesting journey into a prehistoric world. 3.5 stars"
1296,805337701,liked it," I think Jean Auels Clan of the Cave bear is a solid 3.5 stars - maybe 4. A list of what I love and did not love is written below so please read on if you care to know my opinion.  I felt Jean writing was beautiful. It was engaging from the first paragraph. Her style is easy to read, yet intelligent and deep. She has written a beautiful story, describing a time period, a people and way of life so lost to us. She painted very descriptive pictures with her words and I had no trouble imaging whatever bit of the story she was describing at the time.  I was thoroughly invested in the relationship between Ayla, Iza and Creb. I was intrigued with their parent-daughter interaction and the way they tried to understand and assimilate to one another. It was obviously difficult to understand the different way of thinking between Ayla and the Clan born parents. So I loved reading about Iza and Crebs reasoning, trying to understand why Ayla acted certain ways and why she would cry -her eye sickness. I thoroughly hated Broud. He was ignorant and unintelligent. Instead of looking at his own actions and learning from his mistakes, he blamed Ayla for every lecture he ever received. Every reprimand was her fault somehow in his twisted mind. So instead of learning to become a better leader he simply brooded over her actions, always blaming her for everything. It was childish and annoying to read and it was clear that he was going to treat her horribly when he become leader.  I really enjoyed learning about their way of life to a certain extent. I had a difficult time getting super absorbed into their life though. I understand they are supposed to be a different branch of homo evolution than modern man, but I found myself simply getting frustrated at their thinking. I understand they had their theology of spirits and luck and omens, but when it surpassed logic and reasoning it frustrated me. Like when they thought Aylas baby was deformed and had no clue about reproductive ways.  I just also couldn't appreciate the deeply misogynistic society. The men literally hunted and that was it - the women butchered the meat, prepared the meals, made the clothes, made tools bowls and utensils, raised and fed all the children, made the medicine and provided healthcare. Everything. Yet they were lesser than men. Women could easily survive without men, but men would die without women. The feminist in me was completely turned off by this way of life. So bc of these ridiculously misogynists, I didn't really feel a connection to the clan. I was glad when Ayla finally left because I couldnt feel any appreciation or understanding towards their ways. Creb started to understand - the clan way was dying - and I was glad when Ayla was free of them.  Speaking of, I feel like there were times when the writing dragged. I was not surprised by the ending at all, but rather felt as though it was coming literally the whole book. It probably could have happened in about half the pages, ever since we first learned that Broud didn't like Ayla we knew he would torture her when he become leader. We also knew that he would be a terrible leader and make a horrible choices that would ruin the clan way of life. There was sooooo much foreshadowing that it was like ""about frigging time"" when the end came, ""took you long enough"". I know that there are more Children of Earth books, so it makes me feel like this whole book was simply a warm up for Aylas next adventures after the Clan and with the Others. Not sure if I'm going to add the next book to the list or not, we'll see. So in summation - beautiful writing that dragged a bit at times and became a little overly descriptive. Really interesting characters and way of life but the physical abuse, sexual abuse and subjugation of women was a little ridiculous and made me unattached to the Clan and their illogical religious ideas. The ending was incredibly predictable and took entirely too long to get there. "
1296,2524394629,really liked it,A very entertaining read. I recognized lots of survivalist techniques and herbs used. I would be interested in all of the research that went into the book. I felt this was a great feminist novel. Long book but an easy read.
1296,1405004948,liked it,"Efter en jordbävning som tar hela hennes familj ger sig en femårig liten cromagnonflicka iväg på egen hand, mest för att hon inte vet var hon ska ta vägen nu när alla hon känner är borta. Men hon råkar snart på rovdjur; efter att hon blir riven av ett grottlejon är hon alldeles för svag för att fortsätta sin resa genom skogen. Men det är inte bara hennes folk som har blivit påverkade av jordbävningen och snart kommer en neanderthalklan vandrande i hopp om att hitta en ny grotta att installera sin klan i och förbereda sig för vintern innan det är försent. Det är då klanens medicinkvinna får sin på den bleka, sjuka lilla flickan som är så nära döden. Trots att hon uppenbarligen inte är av samma folk som dem låter ledaren kvinnan ta hand om den lilla flickan. Snart är hon en del av deras stora familj; adopterad av medicinkvinnan som älskar henne över nästan allt annat redan bara efter några dagar.Trots Izas kärlek till hennes dotter är det många i klanen som har svårare att acceptera Aylas närvaro i klanen. Hon är inte bara annorlunda och ful till utseendet utan hon visar stora svårigheter för att förstå de sociala regler och tradition som klanen följer slaviskt. Speciellt ledarens son har svårt att ens kolla på henne utan att känna ilskan och hatet bränna inombords – han gör allt han kan för att göra hennes liv så stressigt som möjligt. Jag var irriterad under minst hälften av boken. För jag känner lite... det finns absolut inga bevis på att urmänniskan, så att säga, skulle ha samma patrikala och grovt sexistiska samhällen. Vi vet ingenting om hur deras sociala regler såg ut, eller om de ens hade några. Av den anledningen så är jag otroligt förvirrad över varför författaren inte valde att tackla detta ämne i någon tidsålder vi vet mer om – som medeltiden eller dylikt. För det känns lite konstigt att en karaktär som ska vara grunden till våra förfäder är den som är en sorts feministisk rebell och trotsar precis all sexism i neanderthalarnas samhälle. Just för att våra förfäder, vare sig det var tusen år sedan eller hundra år sedan, har en historia präglat av övergrepp på kvinnor på fysiskt och psykiskt på olika sätt. Jag vet inte. Jag kände mig rätt obekväm med det. Däremot om man ser bortom det så gillade jag ändå boken. Det var en intressant och spännande bok om samhällsregler och jorden för flera tusen år sedan – helt ärligt kändes det lite som en fantasybok då många av dem har en tendens att utspela sig i en tidsålder oftast inte är moderna än vår medeltid. Ayla var en intressant karaktär men det var bara i hennes första kapitel som jag ens kom ihåg att hon var ett barn; jag vet inte men det känns riktigt konstigt. Antingen var detta meningen med hur Ayla var skriven eller så kan författaren helt enkelt inte skriva från ett barns perspektiv utan att låta som hen är fyrtio istället för sju. Men okej.Jag kan verkligen förstå varför folk ser Ayla som en feministisk ikon inom litteratur för hon är en modig liten flicka som söker spänning och absolut inte kan förstå varför hennes kön skulle hindra henne från att göra vissa saker – även om hon senare lär sig att detta är normen och försöker anpassa sig efter det. Men det känns även som att detta matar myten om att urmänniskan var sexistisk på ett liknande sätt som vårt moderna samhälle och därför är det något som är mer eller mindre naturligt. Möjligtvis är det för att jag vet att flera skolor (bland annat min) har visat filmen för sina elever på historielektionerna på ett sätt som får eleverna att anta att detta är en realistisk och korrekt bild på våra förfäder och dess kusiner. Tack men nej tack, säger jag. "
1296,1075931880,did not like it,"In my opinion, the most overrated book of all time. Why?Well, for a start it is considered THE prehistoric classic of all classics, as if it is ""The Lord of the Rings"" of the prehistoric genre. It really, really isn't. In comparison:1) I will be the first to admit that LOTR is also too long winded and not one of my favourite books for that very reason, but Auel takes this level of boredom to a whole other level of yawn with unnecessary details that should be put in a science manual, not a fiction book. And way too many 'God's Eye View' details that seem to come from the POV of a modern Paleontologist, or a (shock horror) modern day author who has studied prehistory a lot and spent not one day learning how to keep their reader truly engaged. At least Tolkien's descriptions make sense from the POV of the character.2)I've read LOTR 4 times because of all of the other things that make it great(near perfect grammar being one of them, and also the fact that it actually deserves to be respected as a book).COTCB is the ONLY book that I have thrown in the bin 3 times because I did not want to torture some other hapless reader into reading it (I'm deadly serious) after trying to endure the first chapter. It has terribly written disjointed sentences that are often way too long. It is obvious that the author hasn't taken the art of writing fiction very seriously at all.The ONLY reason I finally forced my way through it was because it was needed for research.3) LOTR could have had a fair bit of it removed, you know, a chunk, like one slice out of a cheesecake and it wouldn't have any wasted reading time.COTCB needs to have over half of it removed, partly due to overly long sentences with not a scrap of grammatical art to them at all, but mainly due to the ridiculous amount of extra detail on things such as plant types and their uses that belong in a documentary, not a compelling work of fiction.4) LOTR feels like a work of brilliance despite its shortcomings; you really feel what the characters are going through and what's at stake.COTCB feels sometimes in the character, and sometimes like some kind of alien staring down at the Earth taking down science notes.I know I sound harsh here, but harshness where harshness is due. This book deserves harsh treatment, especially because it has been given such a high status.I could tell from the very first sentence that the author cannot write. The ONLY redeeming factor is that if this book was written by an author who had studied how to write properly got their hands on it, it would be an intriguing read; the story itself and what the characters go through is quite interesting. But these interesting parts are few and far between.I'm trying to work out whether the author refused to release COTCB if any editor changed the manuscript she sent in, or whether the editor looked at this mess before them and threw their hands up in disgust saying, ""OMG, how am I going to fix this."" I suspect the former. Just speculation.This is easily the worst (published) book I have read in my life.I would rather read ""The Eye of Argon."" At least you can get a laugh out of that one.If I could give this book a 'no star' or even better -1 star rating I would, but I can't. Oh, what the hell:-*If you want a much, much better read (quite brilliant really), check out ""Shaman"" by Kim Stanley Robertson - He's obviously done his research in the Prehistoric and writing field, and the POV is just about impeccable. That book is a 3-4 star read."
1296,434834331,liked it,"Set in the ancient world, The Clan of the Cave Bear tells the story of Ayla, who is orphaned after a giant earthquake and taken in by a group of cave dwellers who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. Tall, blonde and blue-eyed Ayla is one of the Others and is considered ugly by the short, bow-legged, dark colored, neanderthal Clan people. Over and over again in the story, Ayla (either by accident or design) comes up against the traditions of the Clan people, who are set in their ways and unable to change. I was kind of fascinated by the culture of the Clan, which believes in and worships animal spirits and has a strict hierarchy with men as entirely dominant over their docile and obedient women. The clearly sexist culture of the Clan seems to have been designed to show that this is the stone age and thus be ""realistic,"" while setting it up for Ayla to be more progressive as a woman capable of being equal to men. It's an oversimplification in order to easily play on the reader's sympathies, but for all of that (and for Broud being a single minded and one-dimensional villain), there are some lovely characters in the the clan, such as Creb, the deformed shaman, and Iza, the medicine woman who takes Ayla in. Both, but especially Creb, had some wonderful complexities of character that I rather enjoyed. Ayla her self was a little too perfect. She's good at just about everything she does, except for being docile and submissive. She screws up again and again in terms of Clan traditions, but these screw ups are positives from a modern mindset, so as readers we are clearly meant to take her side against the less evolved Clan. Also, the story got to be a bit repetitive as she screws up, is nearly rejected by the Clan, and then is fogiven..., several times. There were a few things that made me very uncomfortable while reading this book. One, was the concept of racial memory prevalent in the book and the idea that the Clan cannot change their ways, because their culture is genetically endowed in them, a rather disturbing concept, especially in regard to continuing discussions of race. Two, is that Ayla, as blonde and blue-eyed, is set up as the future of the human race, while the dark hair and eyed Clan people are doomed to death because they can't change. I don't care that they are meant to be less evolved and that this is the stone age, the author didn't have to set Ayla off by making her so starkly blonde. It could have been just as clear that she was more evolved by showing her height and body structure as by her coloring. Another thing that was far more minor, and something I'm note entirely sure of, is that I kept scratching my head in terms of the mixture of geography, plant life, and animal species. I mean, I associate the lynx with either Europe or North America and lions and rhinos with Africa, and I'm not entirely sure they ever mixed in natural settings. Maybe they did and I just don't know it, but I kept getting confused about how certain animals ever came in contact with each other. So..., this book is flawed in many big ways, but it was also compelling enough to keep me reading to the end, which left me wondering what the heck happens to Ayla next and willing to pick up the next book The Valley of the Horses to find out. So, I would say, the author has done her job in terms of keeping things entertaining and keeping me reading. "
1296,2402928348,did not like it,"Did not even bother to finish this book. Not sure why it was on the GAR list. Surely there are better sci-fi young adult books out there. And yes, I didn't like the movie (1986) either."
1296,145097248,it was amazing,"In preparation for the final book in the series coming out, I decided I would reread the books of the series again. I've read them many times and they continue to be one of my favorite collections of books that I've read. Of course its not the most perfect series ever written, but I find it so entertaining that I am able to forgive a lot of its problems.Ayla is a young girl who has been left alone in the world after a horrible earthquake steals her family for her. She sets off alone at the tender age of five and after being attacked by a cave lion and collapsing, she is found by a tribe of Neanderthals who are searching for a new cave after their previous one collapsed in the earthquake. At first they aim to leave her behind, but the clan's medicine woman Iza finds some tenderness for the child and begs to bring her with them. Brun the clan leader decides that she may but feels (and will continue later) like he doesn't know if he has made the right choice or not. Since Ayla is of the ""Others"" she doesn't have concept of the Clan's language (which is mostly done through sign) and with Creb's (the clan's Mog-ur spiritual leader) help, Iza teaches her not on the language but how to be a proper clan woman as well. Ayla grows quickly and learns at the same pace and Iza decides that she will be a medicine woman as well and begins to teach her the art. In secret though, Ayla begins learning another skill that could put her in danger with the clan. She learns to hunt with a sling. Such things are forbidden to woman and clan woman would never think to hunt, nor to disobey or do anything that isn't of a domestic art, but Ayla is different and cannot abide by such restrictions. Her secret skills are not the only danger to her however; Broud, the proud son of Brun hates Ayla with a passion and will stop at nothing to make her miserable because of his jealousy. Between him and several other trying instances while she lives with the Clan, Ayla has yet to discover if she is truly in her proper place in the world.The characters in this series are developed really well and every one is important to the story. They all evoke some emotion as well. For example, I can't stand Broud, respect Brun, have affection for Creb and feel that Iza is a motherly figure. Ayla, is a good mix of character and has actions and emotions that are both good and bad and keep her seeming real (this will change in other books of the series but for this one, is done well).The writing is very descriptive but doesn't slow the story down. There is some violence and rape scenes and if this bothers you, you should probably not read this book. I'm sure there are discrepancies with some historical, botanical, etc. facts within this book, but as I don't know much about any of those subjects, it didn't make a difference in the enjoyment of the book for me.Overall I highly recommend the series and even the worse of the books is still entertaining. This edition, Clan of the Cave Bear, especially is one of the better books of the series and a good read even if you don't plan on reading the rest.Clan of the Cave BearCopyright 1980468 pagesReview by M.

1296,404270708,really liked it,"‚Eine Geschichte über uns‘INHALT:Der erste Teil der „Earth’s Children“ Reihe, Ayla und der Clan des Bären von Jean M.Auel, handelt in der Zeit, in der die damals noch lebenden Neandertaler und die sich weiterentwickelten Homo Sapiens, unsere Gattung, aufeinander treffen. Am Anfang des Buches wird beschrieben, wie ein Erdbeben eine Höhle und damit den Lebensraum eines Clans der Neandertaler, den Clan des Bären, zerstört. Diese Gruppe muss sich dann auf den Weg machen, eine neue Höhle zu finden. Ähnlich erging es einen Stamm der Homo Sapiens, dem die nur wenige Jahre alte Ayla angehört. Sie wird durch diese Beben von ihrem kompletten Stamm getrennt, sodass sie tagelang ohne ihre Mutter und ohne Nahrung oder Wasser umher irren muss. Als sie dann auch noch auf einen Höhlenlöwen trifft, kann sie sich nur knapp und mit letzter Kraft vor ihm in Sicherheit bringen und wird trotzdem verletzt. Ihren Kräften am Ende, fällt sie vor Erschöpfung um und ist dem Tode nahe. Glücklicherweise kreuzt der Stamm der Neandertaler, auf ihrer Suche nach einer neuen Höhle, den Weg mit Ayla. Iza, die Medizinfrau des Clans bittet den Clanführer das Mädchen aufnehmen zu dürfen und gesund zu pflegen, obwohl sie nicht Ihresgleichen ist. Nachdem Iza das Kind gesund gepflegt hat, bringt sie es nicht über ihr Herz, die kleine Ayla wieder auszusetzen und bittet dem Clanführer, Ayla in den Clan aufzunehmen, obwohl sie zu den Anderen gehört. Aufgenommen in den Clan, lernt sie immer mehr sich so zu verhalten, wie es Brauch ist, doch ist und bleibt sie immer eine der anderen und handelt sich immer wieder Schwierigkeiten ein.MEINUNG:Ayla und der Clan des Bären ist ein absolutes TOP-Buch. Die Geschichte rund um ein Mädchen, das den Homo Sapiens geboren wurde und auf eine Neandertaler Gruppe trifft, mit ihnen lebt, ihre Sitten und Bräuche zu verstehen lernt und versucht nach Ihnen zu handeln ist grandios. Es macht Freude und weckt die Leselust, der kleinen Ayla zuzusehen, wie sie wächst und ihren Alltag bestreitet.Neben der Protagonisten selbst ist aber auch die unglaublich gut recherchierte und detailgetreue Darstellung des Lebens der frühzeitlichen Neandertaler packend. Es weckt das Interesse an das Verhalten und Leben und schafft es oft einen als Leser zu berühren.Die Charaktere sind von der Autorin echt, authentisch und lebendig gestalten worden. Eine Identifikation mit den verschiedenen Charakteren und dem Nachvollziehen der unterschiedlichen Denkweisen und Handlungen ist gut möglich, da die Neandertaler schließlich auch ein Teil von uns sind.Spannung und die Lust zum Lesen sind in großen Teilen des Buches vorhanden, doch gibt es auch immer wieder Stellen, an denen es schwer fällt sich zu konzentrieren und alles zu einhundert Prozent mitzubekommen. Am Anfang fällt es einem auch schwer in das Buch hineinzukommen, da der Schreibstil oft lange Sätze aufweist und er die Art und Weise der frühzeitlichen Lebewesen nochmals verdeutlicht.FAZIT:Die Autorin hat hier ein grandioses Werk und Abbild unser Selbst geschaffen. Man kann sich glücklich schätzen hier eine Reihe mit insgesamt sechs Bänden lesen zu können. Trotzdem sehe ich noch Potenzial, das Gelungene in den darauffolgenden Bänden zu steigern."

1296,1682047818,really liked it,"I've passed this novel on my hallway bookshelf everyday for around 30 years and always been intrigued by the name and the illustration on the front cover. As I got older and my interests in reading increased, so did my curiosity about this book. I decided to finally take a stand and end my 3 decade-long curiosity, and let me tell you, I'm so glad I did.This book is a real slow burner and doesn't move much from cover to cover, but don't let that put you off as it doesn't mean it's a bad book, quite the opposite, because during those chapters you learn so much and a lot of it, I am led to believe, is based on real research and discoveries.The story is set around 25,000 years ago when the earth was inhabited by both Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon humans, when their evolutionary lines ran parallel with one another and the earth was pure and untainted. The story follows, Ayla, a young cro-magnon girl who is separated from her parents following an intense earthquake that leaves her struggling to navigate the harsh wilderness alone. Ayla is located by a clan of Neanderthal humans who have also been affected by the recent earthquake and are also searching for a new home. The Clan of the Cave Bear, as they are known, struggle to accept Ayla at first, but throughout this book we see a gradual acceptance as Ayla and the Clan learn much of each others ways and personal qualities. BUT, will everyone accept Ayla? The book goes on to follow Ayla into adulthood and deals with some very series issues. I won't say what, as that would ruin parts of the book, but I wasn't expecting such things to happen as the book had been so pleasant to read throughout. It was a bit of smack in the face to start reading such scenes but felt it helped re-enforce that in this age the earth is a harsh and unforgiving land with primitive communities.Jeam M. Auel's writing is beautiful. Her sertences just flowed over me and made this such a pleasant read. She really painted a stunning picture of the earth during those early days, and I often found myself googling information I'd read, to see if it matched the historical aspects she had described. I really enjoyed learning about the clan and felt sad once the story ended, not to mention the way it ended. I felt like part of the clan myself. I will definitely be continuing with the series and can't wait to see what lies ahead.I've given this 4 stars because I felt that, despite it being a slow burner, some chapters had only a faint pulse and could have used a sub-plot running in the background to make it a bit more captivating. Nevertheless, it was still and interesting read and anyone who likes strong female leads will love this book.The book is easy to read and I would recommend it to anyone (including young adults) but be warned it contains scenes of a sexual nature.Peace out x"
1296,767217505,it was amazing," ""But when did you see her talk to me? When did you see her go into the cave? Why did you threaten to strike a spirit? You still don't understand, do you? You acknowledged her, Broud, she has beaten you. You did everything you could to her, you even cursed her. She's dead, and she still won. She has a women, and she had more courage than you, Broud, more determination, more self-control. She was more man that you are. Ayla should have been the son of my mate.""This book was amazing!! I can't believe that I've waited so long to read these books...and now I have five more to read. It's going to be a very busy next couple of months :)This is the first book in the Earth's Children series by Jean M. Auel. She wrote the book back in 1980 (eight years before I was born!) and the final book in the series didn't come out until a couple of years ago in 2011. The books are essentially the story of cavemen - the first people to walk the earth about 25,000 years ago. The first book in the series tells the story of a young Cro-Magnon girl who is orphaned when the rest of her people are killed by an earth quake. She is discovered by Iza, the medicine women of a clan of Neanderthals who call themselves the clan of the cave bear.Iza and her brother Creb, the clan's Mog-ur or magician, become Ayla's adoptive parents and Iza begins to train her as a medicine women. Ayla is excepted as one of the people by the leader, but no everyone agrees, particularly the leader's son Broud. As Ayla grows up, she struggles to conform to the ways of the clan. My favorite part of the book was not only the complex character interactions, but Auel's description of life thousands of years ago. Her writing of the difference between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals is insightful and draws on scientific evidence of evolution and the development of man kind. Intermingled in her story are numerous culture references to religion, family, sex, language, and survival techniques such as hunting and craftmanship. Auel brought up interesting concepts regarding the mind and physical characteristics of the clan how it resulted in little change of the people over hundreds of thousands of years. I'm not sure if other books are out there or not, but this is the first historical fiction novel that I have heard about of read focused on this time period - or anything similar to it.I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series and have already checked out all of the audio books so that I can listen to them on my way to work! From what I have seen so far, the series is very well researched and took over 30 years to complete. You can see some of Auel's sources that she used on her website.See the full review on my blog: http://onceuponatime-bookblog.blogspo..."
1296,808039095,it was amazing,"Before Katniss from the Hunger Games was the role model for strong girls, there was my beloved Ayla, the Women Who Hunts.This book, and the first four of the series, were formative books of my adolescence. I think I was 13 when I first read Clan of the Cave Bear and re-read them dozens of times in my teens. Now in my 30's, I'm re-reading the series to the end to see if they still hold the same value to me.Ayla is strong, stubborn and smart. Everything a teenage girl wishes to be- an adult in the body of a 12 year old. I still admire her and credit her with being a huge inspiration in my life.While other find Auel's love of detail excruciating, I have always relished the descriptions of the scenery and detail of the everyday aspects of life. This was where I first had an inkling that there was a way to live in harmony with the earth, and wanted to learn how to be sufficient like Ayla was. I still am not, but my desire runs deep - it's just not matched by my time or effort :)I adore the juxtaposition of the Clan and the Others. Ayla's struggle for recognition as a person of skill and value in the Clan resonates with women's ongoing struggles for equality with men, while the traditionalists want to pull us back into the patriarchal dark ages because they don't like the changing of the status quo tipping against them. The men of the Clan knew this too - they'd stolen the secrets of the spirits from the women and knew they had to keep them in the dark to keep them suppressed and doing all the cavework so they didn't have the ability to take back what was rightfully theirs. And like religious fundamentalists of today, the Clan women were complicit in their suppression and could not even comprehend why Ayla, this Other, could imagine things being different than they were. But despite my feminist slant on the novel which is nothing more than my reading and personal resonance of it, this book remains an engaging read and a story that brings tears to my eyes even though I know it almost word for word. This is not a book to suit everyone, and that is fine by me. It will always be my favourite and will relish rereading it again sometime. With so many new books clamouring for my attention, it is a rare book I will re-read as an adult. In my youth I could love my favourite books over and over, because time and lack of funds were on my side. Now time poor and book rich, dedicating time to revisit my favourite characters is a luxury I'll always take for my Ayla.With every reading I hope for a happy ending, and my heart lurches and she makes the brave breakaway, choosing the painful future that she believes is best for her son and beloved Clan. Walk with Ursus, strong lady. I'll see you again soon in your valley."
1296,1929026358,it was amazing,A good read 
1296,1743488274,liked it,"The Earth's Children series has been on my to read list for quite a while, and I'm very happy to have finally finished the first book. I read somewhere that the novels are historical and somewhat accurate when referring to geological and humanitarian traits. I am a bit disturbed by that to put it mildly. I honestly know nothing about this prehistoric period, so I wouldn't be abel to identify weather the novel is accurate or not. I simply can't imagine having lived in a time where women couldn't even speak to a man without permission and where a male leader of a clan can decide weather your babies can live after childbirth and condemn you to death for not killing your newborn child after being instructed to do so. Not to mention how they can casually rape you anytime they feel like it. I think the scary part is that it all seamed to become so natural after a while of reading a book, almost to the point where the reader starts sympathizing with some of the male members of the clan, and then when you really think about it, they are all quite barbarian and demeaning. Ayla is a great main character. She is surprisingly bright and has a crazy good memory. The reader really feels for her. Her narrative voice is very honest and engaging and while I found that the plot moved way too slow, her voice made the passtime of repetition of clan ways much more interesting. I kept hoping that Ayla would finally get enough of her poor treatment and leave the clan, but the power of her love for Creb and Iza kept her there. I almost couldn't bear the scene where Broud severely beat and raped Ayla the first time, but it also stirred an anger inside me that just really wanted her to take revenge on him and kept me reading. I had honestly considered putting the book down for good at that point, but I wanted to know his ultimate punishment, so I kept reading. I would like to say that I was satisfied, but that would be a lie. I was disappointed by the ending. I love the power and self-respect that Ayla obtains in the end, but I can't say that I had hoped for something else. I would have so liked to see Broud broken. He is sure to have obtained a place on a list for most horrible book characters of all time. The book is well written in my opinion, why I gave it 3 stars. I wanted to give it higher in the beginning, but I felt that the second half of the book was not quite as intersting as the first story wise. I am hoping for a strong and independent Ayla that won't let men treat her like she is property in the second book. I want to keep reading and find out what happens to Ayla, but I am still undecided if I want to finish the series or not. We will see after the second book. I have never been so grateful for living in the twenty first century!"
1296,598537381,liked it,"I read this in high school and enjoyed it a lot, even though at the time I was unaware that Ayla, the protagonist, is a giant Sue. I found her compelling without really thinking about the implications. You know, because literature really needs another super-special savior-type character who's smarter than everyone and braver than everyone and better than everyone . . . who just so happens to be a light-skinned, blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty. Which may sound odd coming from a white blue-eyed blonde girl reviewer. But I digress.Ayla was pretty cool as a character. I liked that she depended on the kindness of strangers as a lost child after an earthquake, and I liked that the Clan of the Cave Bear took her in and eventually accepted her for the most part. I thought she was an interestingly complex character who figured out that she could suffer silently in her situations or learn to master them--most notably when she was faced with sexual abuse from a very dominant male in her clan and she realized what he got off on was forcing her to be subservient. (She dealt with this by pretending she wanted his attention, and he was unable to get excited about her after that. She figured out his game.) I also liked the complexity of the culture Auel figured out, especially since I've heard she at least did a lot of research. (I don't know how accurate it is. I've never studied such things. But since she did frequently dive into textbook-style recitation, I imagine a lot of it was straight out of whatever she studied. Not the best writing style, but I learned from it.) The mixture of vocal and gesture-based language, the idea of animal totems and matriarchs who heal and have authority, the relationships the characters had with each other . . . it was engaging. Not sure what to think about the Neanderthals' ""racial memories,"" though. I couldn't tell if that was supported by science or what . . . it seemed weird.However, even though I liked her and cared what happened to her, I did get a little tired of how special she was all the time. Look how cool Ayla is! She can hunt and she invented the bra during the Ice Age! So smart and pretty and daring! 'Kay. But I found it acceptable enough in the first book because she was, after all, exceptional, and got treated the same way most exceptional people are treated by their xenophobic societies. It was good enough to make me want to read the rest of the series.People always talk about how much detailed sex there was in these books, which I literally don't remember. I think I skipped over what other people thought were ""the good parts,"" because to me that was ""the boring parts."""
1296,27824216,did not like it,"When I read this book, in January 1981, I was a part-time columnist for a community newspaper. Book reviews were not my thing in those days, but I was so disappointed and irritated by The Clan of the Cave Bear that I made an exception and turned in the following reaction to my editor (I have not touched the book since, but recall the movie as being infinitely better, and quick peeks into Auel's sequels were sufficient to know I would never waste further time on them):For the past four months our county's library has been in possession of a remarkable new novel, one which is now soaring on the best-seller list.The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M. Auel, is based on a probable meeting between two prehistoric branches of the family of man. The Clan is a tribe of Neanderthals, and the strange girl Ayla reared by them is one of the Others -- perhaps a Cro-Magnon.The Clan stands at the end of long centuries of development. It is set in its ways and doomed to extinction in a changing world. The conflict resulting from Ayla's insistence on new (and better) ways typifies problems faced by so many innovators down through the ages.Could this be a feminist novel? It certainly lends itself to that interpretation, if only because the newcomer who challenges her hide-bound elders happens to be female.But alas, in spite of the provocative story line, the novel is flawed by mediocre writing. Auel's prose is sometimes cumbersome as she labors to explain things, and sometimes it is extravagant to the point of being ludicrous:""With a silent prayer to their totems as the frightened, trumpeting, gigantic animal stampeded toward them, the brave young men raced into the face of the charging mammoth, waving smoking torches in front of them. They had the difficult and dangerous job of turning the petrified animal into the canyon.""That passage goes on with combinations like ""panic-stricken pachyderm"" and ""bellowing behemoth,"" but that is enough for our purposes. Clearly, any writer claiming credit for those lines is simply trying too hard.The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book in Auel's Earth's Children series. In some respects it represents a good start. The underlying story is interesting, even moving. Surely there are many aspiring writers who would envy her success thus far.But this kind of success bodes ill for the language. We can only hope that she will improve on her writing by learning a few inglorious mechanics of good usage."
1296,304230729,did not like it,"I really wanted to like this book, and I gave it my best effort, but it just never clicked for me. I think the concept is unique and there is great potential here but Auel spends much of the book focusing on longwinded descriptions of anything and everything Neanderthal that the story gets lost for me. Every time I would start to get into the plot, Auel would insert a tedious description of the scenery or animals or the creation of their tools. It was interesting at first, but the flow of the plot was constantly interrupted.There was so much repetition. Ayla is different, Ayla is smart, and she can grasp new concepts better than the clan. Ayla and Broud hate each other. I kept waiting for something to happen, for it to come to a boil but all I gained was another detailed account of how much Ayla and Broud despised each other for most of the book. When something finally happens and I already had it figured out because it was foreshadowed for four hundred pages.I did find parts of it very interesting such as the Neanderthal’s capacity for memory. Their brains were much larger than humans and much of their learning was inherited through genetic memory and the assertion is it prevented them from storing new memories and thus adapting to the ever changing world, leading to their extinction.The medicine woman was very intriguing and for me this was one part that made me appreciate the wonders of the human race. The ability to survive and to learn the healing arts through the use of plants and other herbals is just incredible. That we have endured for hundreds of thousands of years through our adaptability and our basic instinct for survival is astounding when you look at it from the point of a Neanderthal.There are parts of the book that practically scream sequel to me. It could also be that I’m reading it over twenty years after it was first published, but maybe not. Ayla constantly defies the clan by teaching herself to hunt and make weapons and I know Auel is demonstrating Ayla’s differentness and her lack of conformity, but I also feel like she is preparing her for life on her own, and giving her the survival skills to make it for another book.I feel like this could have been a really great book, but Auel’s research weighs the story down and it falls short for me. I think the author does a great job on the research and it shows she knows what she is talking about but its fiction, not a history text. Granted, it’s historical fiction, but I’m not a caveman, don’t beat me over the head with the research."
1296,2269679008,it was amazing,"What a tremendous novel! I have been meaning to read these for a long time, but have just now embarked on the journey. (There are 6 books in the series.) This book works in so many positive ways. It is a story that is full of heart. I love the character development and the way prehistoric life is portrayed. The book does indeed have a lot of details, but I do not mind that in a novel. It intrigues me. What a powerful story! "
1296,1311039293,did not like it,"I don't really ever write reviews of books. Not for the books I love, not for the books I dislike. But I just had to make an exception. Because this needed to be said. This book isn't even worth the one star I am giving it. It's worth 0 stars. It managed to very successfully alienate me on the first few pages, when the author tried to assure me that Neanderthals possess some sort of telepathic ability to communicate, and a supernatural racial memory, that enabled them to relieve events that happened to their ancestors. Which, if you’ve ever heard of Assassins Creed, that’s pretty much what it is. You can tell an author has little skill in her craft when she needs to resort to a deus ex in the first few pages of his book.But I powered through it, because I had heard the book was good, and the reading was just barely captivating enough for me to be slightly interested. But then it turned out that the book is basically 500 pages of beating on this poor girl. Small spoilers ahead: she gets beaten near to death by a gorilla sized monkey person several times, she gets left to die, detested by the people she loves above all else, works as a slave for men, is abused in every way you can think of, physically and mentally… I mean, basically think of any bad chauvinistic thing you can, and you can bet it happened to her. And all she ever did was being absolutely useful, and helpful and saved several lives. But fine, I said to myself, I guess the author is just trying to convey the old patriarchal societies. But then I came to about midpoint in the book---Before now I have never stopped reading a book because it was too disgusting. And I have read some disturbing things in fiction books. But this book easily took the what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-you cake. This 10 year old girl gets raped by a retarded gorilla monkey human 3 to 4 times a day. And he beats her face to a pulp doing it. It’s sickening. Face cringing. I literally had to stop reading for a while. And then she gets pregnant with his mutant monkey baby. And then I had to stop reading for good. And it’s literally been haunting me since. I do not ever want to see into the sick twisted mind of the perverse author who wrote this. This is not fiction, this is just disgusting sadism. I wish I had never read this book, because the author made me care for the protagonist with the cheesy writing, and then brutally beating her down in every imaginable way. It’s depressing, messed up, and should be rated R."
1296,1203252398,liked it,"I was in need of an audiobook, so I turned to a coworker and asked which book I should listen to next. She turned a little red and told me about this series that has, like, a million books and she's read all of them and loved every single one. She then went on to explain that the books take place in caveman days and things that happen explain why things are they way they are today. It sounded pretty cool, so I checked it out.The voice acting was mediocre. The voice used for Kreb (sorry about the spelling - I'm not 100% on them) was ridiculous, and not in a good way. His voice made me laugh a couple times. It was like a ... creature voice. It's hard to explain. Maybe if a troll and a gremlin had a voice baby, this is what it would sound like.The names were confusing to me. They were all really similar (again, I apologize for the spelling) Kreb, Ayla, Issa, Goov, Brun, Broud, Vorn, Vorg. These last four were really hard for me to keep straight. Wait, who said that? Wait, who did that?The story was so slow. The tempo was way too slow for me to be excited about anything. I wasn't surprised by anything that happened, even by the surprising parts and I attribute this to the slowness. The action was action-y, but there was too much time in between - I was bored.Ok. We get it. She's not built like the rest of the Clan and everyone thinks she's insanely ugly. We get it. She won't have a mate because she's ugly. We get it. Her totem is very strong. The repetition in this book only added to the slow tempo and to my antsy-ness. I only need to be told once, maybe twice - but this was too much. At every turn Auel seemed to find a way to squeeze in that Ayla is ugly. Stop.Overall, this book was pretty meh for me. I could have lived my life happily without having read it. I thought it was going to blow me away because it came highly recommended and has a pretty high average rating on goodreads. I can see the appeal, but I wanted speed. I wanted something that was going to keep my attention a little better.My rating and why: I gave this book 2.5/3 stars. It was pretty meh for me. I wasn't excited to get into the car. I wasn't invested in any of the characters or story lines. I didn't really care what happened to any of them. I did finish the book, though I'm not sure why. I will not be continuing with this series."
1296,791828084,it was ok,"It's amazing. I read this book when I was 13 or 14 and I loved it. I couldn't put it down. After a rereading, I'm mystified that I loved it so much.This is a hard review to write because what I feel about this book is more 'feels' than words and paragraphs so forgive me if I totally fail to get what I'm trying to get across.The overarching problems with this book is two fold: all the characters are one dimensional and she states one thing than does another. Yes. All the character are one dimensional and, as a result, it's rather boring. Ayla is the 'Madonna' of this book. She's perfect. She's better at everyone than anyone else. The rest ... well, I ascribe this to laziness on the authors part. She says all the clan members have 'memories' so she doesn't actually have any of them learn anything. Indeed, she states in numerous places that they can't learn near things and then she goes on how they refuse to learn new things. I felt this was BS.As a result, all the characters remain the same throughout. In fact, I got the feeling that this was one of the reasons why the author believed they 'died out'. But putting that aside, the moment you meet the characters, just know that that's how they are throughout the whole of the book. The second part is a plot thing. She continuously states laws in this world and then proceeds to break them one after another. Pretty much everything she said she later broke in some part of the book. Or what she says makes no sense with reality. But, more than that, I thought her views on the daily life of the clan were ridiculously stupid. Over the top stupid. They were hunter gatherers. That's actually a misnomer. It should really be a gatherer hunters (but men made up that title so naturally they changed it.) It takes a family a four an acre, maybe more, to feed them. They wouldn't be hanging around the entrance and, as a result, the women would've know how to protect themselves.I think the biggest area I have with this book is the views on women. I don't think women were at the top but they certainly didn't drop and spreed whenever a man wanted it. You have that sort of society, yet the author says that unless the woman is mated, that baby is unlucky? What? Those two ideas DO NOT fit together. Sorry. I should stop before I start really ranting ..."
1296,53271973,liked it,"Well, this book gave me a lot to think. Not to much about the theme, really -the setting of the story was pretty much all I needed to be interested in it, and I did enjoy it- but as to the nature of narrative and the creative process. This is a coming of age story, the story Ayla, a CroMagnon girl who is adopted by a Neanderthal clan and educated as a Neanderthal. Their differences are almost too big to bridge, but they manage it. Sort of.And that's the real issue. They do sort of manage to bridge their differences, and there are some positive messages in the book -how love conquers all, for example, I suppose- but I did read the reviews here in Goodreads before reading the story and I was primed to see some of the problems that might not have bothered me so much had I discovered them for myself. For one, Ayla is a total Mary Sue. She can do anything, learn anything, she's beautiful -except not in context, because she's different, but she's A Tall Blond Woman- and her total Whiteness Majesty teaching the dark Neanderthals their limitations is iffy at best. She can defeat any test, beat all adversities. And in some ways that's good, you know, I don't really want to read a book where the female lead is totally useless, but there's a small line between capable and Mary Sue, and Ayla crosses it. Then there are the actual narrative vices, like the fetish for listing things. I know the author did a LOT of research for this book, and hey, I'm happy to read a book that's well researched, but I don't really need to read page after page of lists (trees, herbs, what each herb is for, what kind of rocks are good for tools). There is, again, the small line. A good, well researched story gives enough information to make the story grounded, but this book does tend to get bogged down with it. Still, it does have some inspired moments, some of the characters are really likable -I'm very fond of Creb and Iza and Brun and Uba- and there are some really beautiful sparks of writing every now and then. It's not terribly purple either! just.. sometimes! So, I don't know. I did enjoy the story and I am considering getting the next book because this one ends so openly, but then again... Mary Sue and lists and research fetishes! don't I see enough of that in fic? A question for the ages..."
1296,1158725386,really liked it,"I've been eyeballing this book for years; it fits the usual profile of the SF-survivalist-utopian popular fiction that tends to rouse my interest, but I was always turned off by a foul whiff I got (probably from a movie trailer somewhere) of Daryl Hannah grunting her way through a feature-length film, this sense of the narrative bringing on an unbearable promise of tedium.When a thoughtful (but anonymous) student put the paperback in my mailbox at the end of the spring term, though, the active recommendation and the easy availability of the text overcame my semi-conscious resistance and I quickly became immersed in what is, in fact, a remarkably engaging book. Though unapologetically ""popular"" (dare we say ""lowbrow""), the book strikes a nice balance between plot and description. There's a strong feeling of suspense over the fate of Ayla, the main character, (presumably homo sapiens), a female living with a non-homo-sapiens hominid group, as she develops from crisis to crisis, almost a Jane-Eyreian quality to the text, which might legitimately might be read as bildungsroman. At the same time, there's quite a bit of survivalist description à la Robinson Crusoe (1719) or evoking a post-apocalyptic novel like George R. Stewart's Earth Abides (1949), and Auel does well with the description, providing enough detail to hint at authenticity but not too much to overwhelm the solid plotting.I was especially intrigued by the disability angle of the book. The protagonist, Ayla, fundamentally different from the other hominids of the Clan, is regarded as ugly and her son, sired by one of the men of the Clan, is thought to be deformed and is initially slated for death. So, too, the powerful spiritual leader of the clan, Creb, is born with a disability and is further disabled by an animal attack in youth; while the Clan generally rejects physical disability, though, it recognizes in Creb a powerful spiritual and intellectual force and even his anomalous physicality is ultimately respected and understood in terms of power, rather than merely tolerated or seen in terms of compensatory balance.A thoroughly enjoyable read and one that kept me thinking without offering too much of a challenge.

1296,1413038077,it was amazing,"L’auteur a réussi d’une main de maître son entreprise qui est de nous présenter, sous la forme d’un roman, la société préhistorique à l’ère de l’homme de Néandertal principalement à travers le regard d’Ayla, une jeune enfant de chez les Autres (les Homo Sapiens). Recueillie par une tribu appartenant au clan de l’ours des cavernes, l’enfant esseulée qui a échappé de justesse à un tremblement de terre qui a décimé les siens, va tenter, tant bien que mal, d’adopter les coutumes du clan hôte bien que tiraillée par la nature de sa constitution génétique et physique différente qui l’entraîne parfois à déroger aux règles ancestrales qui régissent le fonctionnement de la société à laquelle appartient sa nouvelle famille.L’écriture est riche et fluide. Le récit est alerte. L’intrigue est bien menée et est ponctuée d’un rebondissement final inattendu qui donne envie de se jeter sur le deuxième opus de cette saga dans l’instant. Il y a un immense travail de documentation en amont de cet ouvrage qui est, en outre, à souligner et à saluer. En effet, la rencontre entre les hommes de Néandertal et les homos sapiens, loin d’être fictive, est une vérité confirmée par des archéologues et paléontologues. Cette œuvre est donc extrêmement bien documentée. Amateurs de préhistoire, je vous recommande chaudement ce premier tome de la saga Les Enfants de la Terre si vous voulez initier un voyage à travers le temps et revenir aux origines de l’humanité ; en espérant que vous l’appréciez tout autant que moi.Je vous invite enfin à ne pas perdre de vue, si vous n’êtes pas habitués à ce genre de littérature, que le contexte de cette histoire prend racine il y a 35 000 ans. Cela vous évitera d’apposer certains jugements critiques, d’un anachronisme grossier, aux prises de position de l’un ou l’autre personnage quant à certains sujets susceptibles de faire échos, dans l’esprit de certains, à des débats sociaux contemporains ou s’en rapprochant. Soyez enfin avertis que certains scènes de rude violence ou d’abus sexuels explicitement décrites, quoi que dans des mots savamment choisis, pourront choquer les âmes les plus sensibles."
1296,911309977,it was ok,"Ugh. Parts are great. Others.... Not so much. The general idea is great. And when we're not being overloaded with info dumps, the writing can be good. But its overshadowed by:1. everything being repeated a million times like we can't remember what we read two chapters ago. The readers are being treated like they're stupid.2. A creepy society that glorifies rape, domestic violence, and child abuse. Seriously. It's very ew.3. Shitty parents who don't protect their kid from sadistic assholes. Seriously. Crew & iza hide behind costumes of loving, proud parents trying to raise her to be a ""good clan women"" but really are just allow their kid to be tormented, abused, and raped. If there had been a CPS worker in cave man times they would have arrested these two for child endangerment. & the fact that they made her suppress all her emotionas. Even if they never hit her, they still Emotionally abused her. 4. Way to much radical feminist rage that puts a freaky amount focus on making the main character a victim but never really having her overcome it, or help the oppressed Clan women, or even get vengeance on Her abuser. It would have made sense if it had all gone somewhere, just seems like a lot of pointless violence.5. Copy and paste type info dumps straight from the encyclopedia. We get it! You did research! Stop stopping the story to tell us about medical plants or evolution. No1 cares.6. Mary Sue alert! 'Nough said.7. Not so subtle racism. White blond blue eyed chick is smarter than the whole of the clan of dark skinned Clan. -_-I read this and book 2 & 3 when I was a senior in high school. & I can't remember why I liked it. :/ I just did. Maybe I liked that when I started reading it, it inspired my Spanish teacher to read it to & I had some to talk to about a series I was enjoying. (No one I know really enjoys reading like I do.).Now... I wanna love it, but I hate it. :( I might read them all just for the reviews, like I do with the ""house of night"" series. Probably is, that's a fun guilty pleasure series. This is just tediously bad! "
1296,1908188274,really liked it,"Interesting read about evolution and love, a bit over descriptive at times where plants are concerned but the Medicine woman parts were fascinating! As we're the various ceremonies and descriptions of ""clan memory "", Overall a great read!"
1296,1221514304,did not like it,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I liked the premiss, I liked the idea of a lost human child, I liked the prehistoric context. I was set up to like it all. But then out came the text book descriptions. As much as I like non-fiction (and I really do like non-fiction, I'm an academic philosopher) this particular instance of info-dumping proved more than I could swallow. A good fiction writer, unlike a non-fiction writer, should be able to use the story to drop information on the reader without this being so painfully obvious. They should be able to employ conversation and events to suggest the information they want to get through to the reader. If they can't do this, if (as is the case with this book) they write a treatise, I simply cannot consider them a good fiction writer. What's worse  The Clan of the Cave Bear isn't even consistent in the information it dishes out. Early on in the book, for example, while Ayla is still living with the Clan it is mentioned that the clan people do not have language for ""thank you"". However, a couple of hundred pages later, a clan member says (surprise surprise) ""thank you"". I mean, honestly! If you're going to go encyclopaedia on your readers, you could at least keep it consistent. Jean M. Auel also portrays an 8 year old human unlike any 8 year old human I have ever encountered. Ayla, whom from the offset you know will survive everything (boring), thinks profoundly about everything - which is not a problem except that she's 8! 8 year olds do not think like that, not with that clarity and continuity. I mean, please, if you're going to go encyclopaedia, at least keep it realistic.To be honest, you don't even have to read the whole book to know Ayla is going to live through everything, become the best hunter on earth, become the only genius alive etc. which is primarily the reason why I put the book down. I know she's going to be fine, that nothing that happens to her is going to phase her so... what's the point? I can read about Neanderthal life from far more accurate non-fiction books on the subject."
1296,2563036014,liked it,"I remember this book from seeing it on my aunt's shelf when I was a kid, and from the Daryl Hannah movie. I never had much interest in it, until a friend on social media told me not to read it, for various reasons. Well, I immediately downloaded a copy of the audiobook, because I'm really ten years old at heart, and if you tell me not to do something, I'm going to do it. I'm a contrarian asshole, that way.Anyway, I'll start by saying, this is not a bad book. It's not high literature, by any means, but it is entertaining, and it has an interesting premise: Ayla, a Cro-Magnon girl, is orphaned when her parents are killed in an earthquake, and is adopted by a group of Neanderthals, the Clan of the Cave Bear. Even though Ayla tries to adapt to the Clan's way of life, she often finds herself at odds thanks to being Cro-Magnon, and therefore, more intelligent than her adopted Neanderthal family members. Over the years, Broud, the son of the Clan's leader, develops an intense hatred for Ayla and starts to rape her, repeatedly. A pregnancy results from the rape, and Ayla gives birth to a son. At the very end of the novel, Broud becomes the leader of the Clan and puts a ""death curse"" on Ayla, banishing her and forcing her to leave her son behind and to wander the earth, alone. Now that the obligatory plot synopsis is out of the way, I will get into the good, the bad, and the ugly about this book... THE GOOD 1. The world Auel created is rich in detail, and I felt like I had been transported to prehistoric Europe. I know some reviewers were frustrated with the long passages describing plants, animals, and terrain, but I listened to the audio version, and those were some of my favorite parts of the book. A good historical fiction novel will make you feel like you are there, alongside the characters, and Auel certainly accomplished that. Also, the details about the Clan way of life felt very real, for better or worse. I never doubted that I was reading about a real culture, even though there were a few wonky details that made me cringe. So, A+ for Auel doing all that research, and putting her all into the world-building aspect of the novel.2. Ayla is a heroine you can root for. Yes, she is a bit of a Mary Sue, but to me, she was refreshingly proactive and  not  obsessed with romance, the way a lot of modern literary heroines tend to be. Instead of mooning over a vampire boyfriend or getting spanked by a creepy rich dude, Ayla does things like hunt, learn to make tools, and heal the sick and injured. Even if she  is  naturally good at everything she tries, I have to give Ayla a little credit for living her own life, and doing what she wanted to do, patriarchy be damned. She's also a genuinely good person who thinks of other people before she thinks of herself, even when those people aren't being very nice, to her. Eyeroll-y, sure, but still admirable.3. The ending ripped my heart out, especially the very last lines. Okay, enough about that, moving on... THE BAD 1. The book meanders in the middle, and it gets repetitive. For about 80% of the book, the story goes like this: Ayla does something that goes against the way of the Clan, the Clan tells her she must be punished, most often with a death curse, the Clan has a meeting to discuss what's to be done with Ayla, someone (usually Creb) defends Ayla, the Clan is persuaded to change their minds, and Ayla is allowed to keep doing the thing she isn't supposed to be doing. Lather, rinse, repeat. After the second or third time this happens, you begin to wonder if you somehow started re-reading a previous chapter, but nope, you are, in fact, moving forward. I think a good 200 pages could have been cut from this story, without losing anything. The editor kind of dropped the ball on this one, TBH.2. Broud has no reason to hate Ayla so much, and Brun, the leader of the Clan, is a colossal idiot. Broud apparently hates Ayla because he feels that her accomplishments overshadow his, but the amount of hate he carries for her over the course of a decade doesn't make much sense. Ayla even saves Broud's son from drowning, and he still wants her to die. I think this part of Broud's character could have been fleshed out more, instead of making him a one-dimensional villain.Oh, and Brun, the leader of the Clan, is a huge moron. All throughout the book, whenever we see things through Brun's POV, we learn that Brun thinks Broud will be a bad leader; Broud is selfish, has a temper, and acts impulsively. These are characteristics that do not make a good leader, and Brun knows this, but he decides to make Broud leader at the end of the book anyway, and...he is SURPRISED to see that Broud becomes a tyrannical, asshole leader. Say, what? All Brun ever talked about were his doubts over Broud being in charge, and then he is puzzled when Broud starts swinging his dick around, and making the worst decisions, possible? Okay. Brun, buddy, you're not too bright, not even for a Neanderthal. Buy a clue.3. Caveman Olympics. Yes, you read that right, this book has Caveman Olympics. Trust me, it sounds a lot more exciting than it really is. THE UGLY 1. Broud's rape of Ayla is horrific, and brutal. I've heard people say their parents banned them from reading this book because of the ""sexy parts"", but I really want to know if they read the same book I did, because there are no ""sexy parts"", in this story. There is no  sex , it's written as an act of violence and dominance, towards a child (Ayla is ten when the rape begins, which is considered an adult age in this world, but...ICK). If you are triggered by this sort of thing, forget about reading this book, entirely. Not only is the heroine repeatedly raped, but most women in this world have no sexual agency, and must ""assume the position"" if a man wants to use them in that way. It's very gross and unsettling to contemporary readers, and I can understand why some people have problems with it.2. There is subtle racism, in this book. Ayla is blonde and blue-eyed, while the members of the Clan are darker skinned, and dark-eyed. Since Ayla is basically the perfect human specimen, there is an unsettling implication, there. Now, I'm not going to accuse Auel of racism or anything, but this is another detail that modern readers will find hard to swallow, especially since modern science has discovered that Neanderthals could, in fact, be fair-haired. But, whatever, it is what it is.Conclusion: reading this book is a lot like watching a movie from the 80's that has a date rape/sexual assault scene, in it. You hate that scene, you know it's outdated and wrong, but there is still plenty of other things in that movie you like, so you watch it, anyway. Maybe you skip the offensive scene, maybe you don't, but you take all the good things from it, and you still enjoy it. That's the experience I had with ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"". This book was written in 1980, so of course it's going to be problematic, but I enjoyed reading about Ayla's journey, and it kept me entertained enough to download the sequel, so consider me a fan. Now, onto book two of the ""Earth's Children"" series, ""The Adventures of Jondalar's Amazing Horse Cock"". I believe that was the working title, before they changed it."
1296,61986850,it was amazing,"Inexplicably perhaps, but I have always loved this series by Jean M. Auel. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first volume in her, to-date, five-volume Earth's Children series. Although the first novel was written and published in the 1980s, Ms. Auel, in my opinion, has done a wonderful job of incorporating the latest anthropological theories, research, and findings into her fictional account of the life of a young Cro-Magnon woman (Ayla) and her years of living with a small group (clan) of Neandertal humans in what is now the Crimean Peninsula during an ice-age some 30,000 years ago.The writing, while probably not great literature, is certainly solid enough; at times quite lyrical and descriptive. To me, it is fascinating to think about what life may have been like for our early human ancestors; both anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) and Neandertal man (Homo neandertalensis). Ms. Auel does an admirable job of describing the similarities and differences between the two human species, and the disadvantages that ultimately led to Neandertal extinction approximately 20,000-25,000 years before present, and advantages that led to the great explosion of modern humans across the planet. Additionally, Ms. Auel presents an incredibly fascinating portrait of the ecology and environment that these peoples occupied, foraged in, and depended upon in the region that is now known as the Black Sea and Crimean Peninsula.I have read a lot of rather dry, yet very interesting, anthropological and archaeological texts and technical papers about Neandertals, and early modern humans; and it has been great fun to read an engaging and relatively historically accurate fictional narrative, that incorporates much of this data, about the small groups of peoples that populated the planet during some very harsh times so very long ago. If you have an interest in early human cultures, anthropology, and ice-age-environmental ecology then Ms. Auel's Earth's Children series is right up your alley."
1296,412027488,did not like it,"I did not finish this book because it hit a point for me when I was just so done. I made it a third of the way and realized that even if the book picked up an the author turned an amazing new leaf of good literacy that I would still think this book to be pretty bad. Seems kind of disappointing after I've heard so many good reviews of the series. I might come back to read the rest but only if I can't find anything better to read. I'm going to take a sentence from page 105 to explain exactly what horrific literacy I'm talking about: [The women started leaving not long afterward, to begin preparing evening meals. Uka stayed with Iza, though Ebra and Oga kept glancing over inconspicuously while they cooked. Ebra served Creb as well as Brun, then brought food for Uka, Iza, and Ayla. Ovra cooked for her mother's mate, but she and Oga returned quickly when Grod went over to Brun's hearth to join the leader and Creb. They didn't want to miss anything and sat down beside Ayla who hadn't stirred from her place. ]So far the story is beyond bland. All the characters have really done is eat and do lame cave people stuff. I appreciate all the research done in the writing of this book to make it as realistic as possible. It seems that there is a bit of a sci-fi aspect with the rituals the clan are preforming. I think some of it could have been written much differently to add more spice to the story. Like adding more of a sci-fi aspect. Otherwise the concentration of the writing is mostly explaining how the characters basically picked flowers and struggled to communicate. I understand how difficult an approach the author is taking to bring a realism to the story, but even still I think the writing itself could have been much better. I know it's hard to have strong characterization for characters who mostly communicate in grunts, but the lack of excitement and characterization made this story seem so bad to me."
1296,1143623106,did not like it,"First of all, if you want an excellent speculative deep-history story set in the ice age, go read Shaman by Kim Stanley Robinson. Like all of his work, it is meticulously researched and beautifully crafted.The characters in Clan of The Cave Bear are well-thought out and develop throughout the story. The author's thought and effort are evident. Unfortunately, I disagree with many of her decisions and ultimately found the book to be upsetting on a number of levels. By the time I put it down, I felt I had lost hours of my life and happiness on it.The introduction makes it clear that the author did a LOT of research before writing the book. Unfortunately, the text also makes this clear, as there are sections that read like a natural history textbook. I am a nature lover and science teacher, but even I don't see added value in listing the precise species that live in a particular field.SPOILERS AHEAD!I could accept the author's premise that Neanderthal culture was deeply misogynistic, although I am really not sure why she felt that needed to be the case. I could not, however, accept the detailed account of the brutal rape and beating of a 12 year old girl. I do not understand how the author, editor, and publisher felt that this was an acceptable decision. It was deeply upsetting to me that this was followed by descriptions of her physical and emotional agony through repeated episodes of public rape over the course of months. However, the resolution of the situation really makes me wonder how the author herself sees the world and human relations. The rape victim, upon discovering that she is pregnant, is so overjoyed by the life growing within her that she no longer minds being raped. Her persistent attacker, deprived of his power-driven sexual prowess, is unable to perform and therefore stops raping her. Who thought it was okay to publish this hateful misogynistic narrative?"
5194,1954341115,it was amazing,"What About the Children?The Reader is a profound exposition of the 'second generation' issues concerning moral guilt for the Holocaust. But it is, I think, also relevant more generally to the way in which human beings get ensnared incrementally into the evils of their society. We are all inevitably involved in this larger problem. And, like the SS guards at a Nazi death camp, we are unaware of the moral peril of our situation, and unwilling to remove ourselves from that situation even when its harmful effects are obvious.To be more personal and concrete: At the moment I have three acquaintances, each of whom has had a reasonably successful corporate career - one as an investment manager in the City, the second as a senior executive of an international sporting organisation, and the third as a partner of a global accounting firm. All three are, however, deeply dissatisfied with their lives. Their marriages, they all feel, are on the edge of breakdown. One has had a psychological breakdown and is now institutionalised. Another has been made redundant and, despite a large payout, sees nothing but existential gloom for the rest of his days. The last is disgusted with the complete indifference of both his colleagues and clients to the visible harm their firms are inflicting on the world. All of them, it shouldn't be necessary to emphasise, 'volunteered' for the careers and styles of living they now suffer from.A central question posed to The Reader's defendant in her trial for causing the death of Jewish prisoners trapped in a burning church is, ""Why didn't you unlock the door?"" I posed essentially the same question to my three acquaintances: ""The situation you now find yourself in did not occur overnight."" I gently suggested, ""Therefore as you perceived what was happening to your mind, to your family, to the quality of your life, to national culture, why didn't you stop?"" In principle, stopping is even less difficult than unlocking a door. The reasons given for not stopping were almost identical in all three cases: ""I can't afford to."" The financial denotation of 'afford', however, wasn't the main point. Guilt in not providing what their families needed was important. Financial compensation had become just that - compensation for the companionship of marriage and family that had been denied. This was associated with a fear of the disappointment or disapproval by their friends and family. Success is naturally a social matter defined for us by those we know well. But upon pushing a bit harder, it was also clear that the common strand among them was that each believed he had somehow let himself down by not realising the full potential he believed he had in him. This psychic driver of ""being the best you can"" struck loud bells in my own experience. It also reminded me of the remarkable book by Karen Ho, a social researcher from Princeton. Her ethnographic study of the life and culture of Wall Street, Liquidated, is as insightful as it is troublesome to anyone who asks themselves why indeed they have not simply unlocked the door to an alternative life. As she discovered in her employment in an investment bank, the culture of professional firms like Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Company is grounded in a simple, direct message: ""You are here (or want to be here in the case of applicants) because you are the best and want to be among the best."" Call it the Culture of Presumptive Excellence (CPE) for short.CPE is what stimulates people to work consistently impossible hours, in places distant from home, with no respite. It also justifies the treatment of subordinates as corporate fodder, hiring and firing with panache, and insisting on single-minded loyalty as one moves up the ranks. Standards of excellence, after all, do not maintain themselves. In my experience, CPE, not compensation, or excitement, or 'perks', is the motive force of not just Wall Street but of the entire global corporate world. Escaping that world is no easier than escaping the totalitarian society of Nazi Germany. The identity and the obligations of 'being the best' is a very powerful lock indeed, without any obvious key.Of course CPE is not merely a corporate problem; it is a societal problem. It is a problem of the perceived order. Schlink's war-trial defendant, Hanna, did not unlock the doors of the church to let the prisoners out, not because she is evil or because she was following orders. She was afraid, she says, of the disorder that would have ensued: prisoners running amok without the proper supervision to get them back in marching line. It is this same disorder that my three acquaintances seem to fear most. The problem with being 'the best' is that the criterion for being best has to be set by someone with authority. The self-identity of the best depends on this. To reject this classification and the criteria that define it, one also must reject the authority that sanctioned it. This authority is so diffuse throughout society, that to reject it means to reject the entire society. The loss of both identity and context for establishing a new identity is the ultimate disorder, chaos.Jean Korelitz, for example, herself a former admissions officer for Princeton, shows how pervasive the CPE is in the steps before entering the corporate world in her novel, Admission. Princeton's 'pitch' to applicants is exactly the same as that of the Wall Street firms to its applicants: ""As the best, you will want to stay among the best, so apply to Princeton."" The stage before this, entry into prep school, is also fictionalised from experience, in turn, by Louis Auchincloss, particularly in his novel, The Rector of Justin. The message doesn't vary: ""We are the best and will help you stay among the best.""The destruction of personalities, families, and culture by CPE is systematic. And it is systematically defended even by those whom it excludes. The effects of CPE extend beyond those who are certifiably, as it were, the best to those who aspire to become part of the elite. Deficiencies are masked by the aspiration itself, which is merely the acceptance of the defining authority. In The Reader, Hanna is able to hide her secret shame by joining the SS, an elite corps. I can say with a moral certainty that all three of my acquaintances have what are, to them, equivalent to Hanna's secret deficiencies. Fear of exposure is therefore a powerful motivation to keep the system going, to promote its stable orderliness even when it is so evidently destructive.Schlink's narrator, Michael Berg, knows that Hanna could not have committed the crimes she is accused of because of the secret she is unwilling to reveal. She may be guilty but not as guilty as she appears, or of what she is charged with. What duty does he have to unlock the door with which she has imprisoned herself? To speak up, either to her or the court, would expose her to profound shame, greater shame even than that of being found guilty of war crimes perhaps. And if he does decide to speak up, how should he do it - to her? To her lawyer? To the judge? I feel the same dilemmas in advising my acquaintances, knowing that any mis-step could provoke yet more consternation as well as a pointed lack of gratitude for my solicited but still impertinent advice.Berg's father, a philosopher, advises a simple ethical rule: don't try to second guess the criterion of the good that an individual has established for himself. This is useless advice. It simply anoints conformity as the ethical norm. Conformity is the opposite of resistance, a capacity for which is essential to avoid personal co-optation, to either totalitarianism or corporatism. Resistance which can take many forms. All of them dangerous because they challenge order and the power behind order. And all demand apparently un-virtuous behaviour. How can one advise such a course to anyone one cares about? Ultimately Berg fails to act at all. I find myself in Berg's position. I feel any advice I can give is vapid. To suggest resistance against a corporate culture that is so pervasive and so domineering is madness. I can only ask the question ""Best is the superlative for what?"" But I can't answer the question. I am as trapped as anyone else. Will the children of my acquaintances, or my own, look at the lives of their parents with the same dismay as the so-called second generation of German children perceived their parents after 1945?Schlink's story ends in tragic sadness and unresolved guilt. Perhaps no other ending is possible."
5194,632657,it was ok,"booring. is that a review?? this was just very flat to me. i wasn't offended by the subject matter - i could care less about the ""scandalous"" elements. but the writing was so clinical and thin. at one point, i blamed the translation, but c'mon - its not that hard to translate german to english (i can't do it, of course, but it's supposed to be one of the easiest translations) i have nothing helpful to say about this except i was bored bored bored. the characters were unappealing, the ""twists"" were ho-hum, and i thought it very dry .i don't know what oprah was thinking...come to my blog!"
5194,36808908,really liked it,"I have the feeling there's more than one way of looking at this book. On one hand it can be viewed as a bildungsroman, it follows Michael Berg since the age of 15 till full maturity. On the other hand, it's the post-war German generation coming to terms with their past, the Nazi crimes and their parents' guilt. Guilt, actually, is a recurring theme in the novel: Hanna is guilty of war crimes, Michael is guilty for betrayal (plus he feels guilty for having loved Hanna and asks himself if that makes him a criminal as well), Michael's father for not being enough of a father. The question you get stuck with, after reading, is Hanna's question addressed to the judge: ""What would you have done?""The question I am stuck with is: What would have happened if the truth had been told? On a bohemian level, the novel is about love for books and reading, so that's a plus for bookworms :)"
5194,395499912,it was ok,"I'm not really sure why this book is considered one of the best books of all time and managed to make into the big 1001 list. Most of the time, even if I don't like a book, I tend to understand why someone else picked it. In this case, I'm rather clueless. Is it, perhaps, that people see in it some message about humanity when Hanna won't purchase her freedom with the secret she has kept hidden for years? Is it the vivid sexual tale of a teenage boy with an older woman? Are we supposed to be shocked by it?The novel starts with a romance when fifteen year old Michael finds himself ill on the way home from school and is taken in by a woman twice his age. They begin an affair which is described by numerous critics as ""erotic"". This was the first hurdle my enjoyment came up against. When I was fifteen with raging hormones and an extremely good-looking history teacher, I would probably have been able to appreciate the eroticism of such an opportunity - to have an illicit affair with someone much older and experienced. But that's just a bunch of teenage fantasies that would never have become realities. Now, it creeps me out. I couldn't see it as a love story, I saw it as being about an adult who takes advantage of a child (all very ironic when I think about my first interpretation of Lolita, but I guess I grew up somewhat).It has been suggested that we are expected to draw parallels between Hanna's secret and the behaviour of most German people during the second world war, that is why Schlink deliberately set the novel in this fragile post-war period. But I'm really not a fan of stories that are one big metaphor for something else... or no, maybe it isn't so much that I don't like that, but more that it has to be done in a manner which I find appealing and it has to be obvious. I refuse to believe in metaphors that have been proposed by some random critic and then jumped on by everyone else. I'm trying not to give away Hanna's secret in case there are people who haven't worked it out straight away, but I wasn't buying into this metaphor.This combined with the author's sparse tone quickly distanced me from the novel. I just prefer interesting and complex characters, an engaging plot, relationships I care about... I prefer all this over metaphor. In the end, metaphor is subjective and if I can't see it myself without someone else suggesting it to me then I believe either the author failed to make their metaphorical point clearly enough or the metaphor itself doesn't exist."
5194,1515025559,really liked it,"This is the deep character development and type of writing that i've been craving. A book that made me think and ask so many questions. Sometimes I felt like I was struggling through really heavy writing, but the actual story itself and the moral questions that arise from its telling were really, really interesting and I surprised myself with how much I found myself contemplating this novel. Someone told me there's a movie with Kate Winslet and she is my actual wife so i'm gonna go track that down bye"

5194,39404654,it was amazing,"There are some books you know will stay with you forever, and Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is definitely one of them. It has been highly critically acclaimed, winning the Boston Book Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, and it deserves all the praise it has received. The Holocaust is a difficult, though much covered, subject matter, and this novel has a sure touch and an appealing lack of judgment with it. The story begins in the world of almost-childhood of fifteen-year-old Michael Berg, recovering from a summer of hepatitis, begins a relationship with Hanna, a much older woman he meets by chance. The first part of the novel, untouched by the shadow of the recent war or Germany's disturbed and dangerous past, deals with Michael and Hanna's burgeoning relationship, and the little fears and worries that can make up one big problem. Eventually, as we know it must, their relationship ends and Hanna moves away.When the book moves on to the second part, the tone has changed considerably. Michael, now a law student, attends the trial of female Nazi war criminals. To his shock, one of them is Hanna, who had been a camp guard at Auschwitz. I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for you, but the Holocaust is seriously considered in the light of philosophy and moral responsibility. There is an attitude that one becomes numb to the horror of it all if too exposed to it, and this book does not go into ghastly detail, but rather examines even more painful details: who was to blame, how do we live with the suffering, how can one atone, and most of all, what is the next generation to do?It also looks at what it means to love someone, how much we can accept of them and how blind we can be to those we love. Love, guilt and betrayal feature prominently in this novel.In many ways Hanna was innocent, and yet it becomes apparent that she lived every day with terrible guilt; Michael was a victim of her actions, and yet he too is guilty by association. The reader of the title is Michael, who read to Hanna during the early part of the relationship; the reader is Hanna, alone in prison occupying herself by learning about the experiences of camp inmates. The reader is selected individuals in the camps who read aloud to Hanna, and may have died because of it. But most of all, the reader is ourselves; the title points the finger at us, because now we have the knowledge, what should we do with it? If all it takes for evil to prevail is for the good to remain silent, then how innocent are any of us? And how can we deal with the subsequent guilt? There are so many layers to this subtly complex novel that having just finished it, I have to start it again. The transforming power of words is negated by their ultimate futility, and actions in this novel speak deafeningly loud.If we have a responsibility towards the past, to learn from it, and I believe we do, then this book will help us to go some way towards fulfilling it."
5194,753268507,really liked it,"Der Vorleser = The reader, Bernhard SchlinkThe Reader (Der Vorleser) is a novel by German law professor and judge Bernhard Schlink, published in Germany in 1995 and in the United States in 1997. The story is told in three parts by the main character, Michael Berg. Each part takes place in a different time period in the past. Part I begins in a West German city in 1958. After 15-year-old Michael becomes ill on his way home, 36-year-old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz notices him, cleans him up, and sees him safely home. He spends the next three months absent from school battling hepatitis. ...Part 2, Six years later, while attending law school, Michael is part of a group of students observing a war crimes trial. A group of middle-aged women who had served as SS guards at a satellite of Auschwitz in occupied Poland are being tried for allowing 300 Jewish women under their ostensible ""protection"" to die in a fire locked in a church that had been bombed during the evacuation of the camp. The incident was chronicled in a book written by one of the few survivors, who emigrated to the United States after the war; she is the main prosecution witness at the trial. ...Part 3, Years have passed, Michael is divorced and has a daughter from his brief marriage. He is trying to come to terms with his feelings for Hanna, and begins taping readings of books and sending them to her without any correspondence while she is in prison. Hanna begins to teach herself to read, and then write in a childlike way, by borrowing the books from the prison library and following the tapes along in the text. She writes to Michael, but he cannot bring himself to reply. After 18 years, Hanna is about to be released, so he agrees (after hesitation) to find her a place to stay and employment, visiting her in prison. On the day of her release in 1983, she commits suicide and Michael is heartbroken. Michael learns from the warden that she had been reading books by many prominent Holocaust survivors, such as Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, Tadeusz Borowski, and histories of the camps. The warden, in her anger towards Michael for communicating with Hanna only by audio tapes, expresses Hanna's disappointment. Hanna left him an assignment: give all her money to the survivor of the church fire.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: نوزدهم ماه فوریه سال 2004 میلادیعنوان: برايم كتاب بخوان ؛ نویسنده: برنهارد شلینک؛ مترجم: بهمندخت اویسی؛ تهران، نشر فرزان، 1381؛ در سیزده و 239 ص؛ شابک: 9643211703؛ چاپ دیگر با عنوان: کتابخوان؛ تهران، نشر تاریخ ایران، 1388، در 204 ص؛ شابک: 9789646082755؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان آلمانی - سده 20 مداستان در سال 1958 میلادی در آلمان آغاز می‌شود. میشائیل، نوجوان پانزده ساله، بطور اتفاقی، با زنی به نام هانا، آشنا و به او علاقمند می‌شود. هانا هر بار که میشائیل نزد او می‌رود، او را وادار می‌کند، تا برایش با صدای بلند کتاب بخواند. میشائیل روزی متوجه می‌شود، که هانا بدون آنکه نشانی از خود برجای بگذارد، شهر را ترک کرده است. سال‌ها می‌گذرد، و میشائیل بزرگ می‌شود. او در رشته ‌ی حقوق تحصیل می‌کند، و روزی، در یکی از دادگاه‌ هایی که برای مجازات جنایتکاران جنگ جهانی دوم برپا ‌شده، هانا را می‌یابد. هانا در جایگاه متهمان قرار گرفته، و شواهد بر این دلالت دارند که او در زمان جنگ، نگهبان زندانیانی بوده است، که به شکل وحشیانه ‌ای قتل‌عام شده ‌اند … با اقتباس از این داستان فیلمی نیز به همین نام ساخته شده است. ا. شربیانی"
5194,2529744553,liked it,"The biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that it made me feel...nothing. I didn't feel connected to the characters or to any part of the plot. This is quite a bummer, as it deals with a pretty heavy topic. I feel like the author intended to write the story this way though, because the writing style in general has a certain type of ""coldness"" to it, and the true feelings of a character are never really explored. Some people might not be bothered by this, but I personally simply prefer feeling close and connected to the characters of a story. This doesn't make the entire book bad though. It certainly was interesting, and Bernhard Schlink is skillful with how he uses words. He describes mundane activities in a wonderful and fascinating way, and this makes me understand 100% why so many schools choose this novel as part of their required reading material.I also appreciated how he always got straight to the point, instead of writing unnecessary details to prolong the plot points we all already know are coming. I also couldn't help but feel disgusted at the things taking place in the first part of the book, and I wish the problematic aspects were explored further, instead of just brushing upon the issue later on.Overall, this was a good book to read inbetween, but nothing life changing or special."
5194,977167460,it was amazing,"This novel breaks so many taboos, it is hard to know where to start reflecting on it. And yet, its plot is not unrealistic or uncommon.It is about a sexual relationship between a young man and an older woman.It is about illiteracy and shame.It is about crimes against humanity, committed out of helplessness and an egocentric wish to hide one's own weakness.It is about the Holocaust weighing on the shoulders of post-1945 Germany's population.It is about the past being reshaped in memory when further knowledge about a person adds a new layer to a relationship.It is about the coexistence of complete indifference towards the lives of many human beings and compassion for one specific individual.It is surprisingly not much about hatred, despite the topic.It is about overcoming a disability.It is about facing justice - or not.It is painful to read. And yet hope hides in a corner.If you can't read it yourself, find someone who is willing to read it to you. Or record it on tape. Literacy is a massive achievement and immensely important for human communication.Read it!"

She did not know what she should or could have done differently, and therefore wanted to hear from the judge, who seemed to know everything, what he would have done. "" This same question is posed in other situations throughout this book. Should Michael, being the only other person to know Hanna's secret, have exposed this secret in order to help her during the trial? Should Michael have been more understanding toward Hanna, after the trial?Should the average German citizen feel shame for not doing more to avert the Holocaust? How should today's German citizen feel towards their ancestors that had to endure World War II? As 'that guard', what should Hanna have done? You be the judge..........."
5194,106345787,did not like it,"It's too simple to say I read any single book because I want to read it. There are dozens of reasons I'll pick up a particular title: I like the author; I like the subject matter; the book is an award winner; the book comes with many trusted recommendations; I was supposed to read the book in high school and I feel guilty because I played Goldeneye on my N64 instead. I will freely admit that I read War and Peace simply to say I read War and Peace. I'd take it to the cafeteria every day and let people see me with it. I was trying to project a certain image; unfortunately, the image I projected was a creepy loner way too interested in Russian melodrama. I read The Reader because it had Nazis. And because it prominently featured a deviant sexual affair. Sold and sold. I dared think that Bernhard Schlink's novel might be that rarest of things, these days: truly transgressive. I mean, sex and Nazis and a literary pedigree to boot. Where do I sign up? This slim novel tells the story of an affair between 15 year-old Michael and the far-older Hanna, with whom he has an affair in West Germany in 1958. Hanna, a tram conductor, comes to Michael's aid when Michael falls ills. Later, Michael's mother forces Michael to go thank Hanna; after a laughably stupid seduction (the literary equivalent of that old porn standby, the copy repairman), the two are having an affair. I guess this is shocking? Taboo busting? I don't know. I can't really muster much moral outrage at statutory rape when it is set against the recent background of the Holocaust. Moreover, the scenes between the two ""lovers"" (how I despise that phrase!) are written in such a mundane, clinical fashion, that I could only speculate that Schlink (or his translator) was a technical writer, taking time off from telling me the side effects of Ditropan. (In reality, Schlink is a judge, and I suppose the detached, just-the-facts-ness of The Reader could be compared to a legal brief). The affair goes on for awhile. It doesn't generate much heat, since both the main characters are constructed out of cardboard, with macaroni faces and yarn for hair. The title is also explained - partially - because Michael must read aloud to Hanna before they Biblically unite. That sound you hear is my eyes rolling. Eventually, Hanna disappears. Seven years later, Michael is a law student, and he attends a war crimes trial where - SHOCK! - Hanna is on trial. Turns out she was a concentration camp guard: think Mary Kay Letourneau crossed with Heinrich Himmler. It's hard to screw up a novel about a Nazi pedophile, but it happens here. There is always going to be tension when a fictional work of art (using that term loosely) is set against the backdrop of a recent tragedy. Until the last person who survived said tragedy is dead, any author daring to touch the subject is going to get dinged a little. We can all argue about the morality of such fictionalizations, but the point is moot. It's going to happen. Schlink obviously knew the dangers going in, and tried to avoid them. In doing so, he wrote a book that is simply flat. There are two directions to take a story like this. First, there is over-the-top, Inglorious Basterds-style pulp. Just accept that your book is basically fan-fiction from the SS Experiment Camp line of movies, and wait for Cinemax to call with an offer. The second direction is to make a serious, searching novel about an ordinary person who survived the Holocaust, but as a cog in the machinery of death, rather than a survivor. Explore how that person lives each day wtih the things he or she has done. This kind of book would take a lot of psychological digging, and there aren't a lot of authors up to this task. The Reader tries to do a little of both, and ends up a big, dull, intellecutally-insulting dud. As already noted, the love affair generates slightly less heat than the pairing of Liza Minnelli and David Gest. The decision to include a statutorily illegal relationship was obviously meant to garner attention, but it fails to shock, titilate, or even vaguely incite any interest. The transition to the courtroom, and beyond, is even worse. Here, the author makes a half-hearted attempt to avoid moral relativism, and then falls right into that trap. In an epic bit of reductionism, Schlink manages to equate the tragedy of the Holocaust with - spoiler alert, I guess - adult illiteracy. If only that was a joke. Schlink's idea of depth is to fill a couple of pages with facile hypothetical questions that he helpfully leaves unanswered. All the better; I doubt I would care about what answers he discovered. While Part I of The Reader is a tepid affair between two paper dolls, and Part II reduces the Holocaust to one SS Guard's illiterate shame, Part III manages, stunningly, to get worse. The epilogue, which must be read to be believed, is so stilted, awkward, and glib that I almost felt bad for the characters/ciphers forced to utter the tortured dialogue. I suppose I got what I deserved. It's like when you click on a hyperlink for naked celebrity photos and get a computer virus instead. (Or so I've been told...) I picked up this book thinking it might be trashy, and it turned out it was, but just not the kind of trash I enjoy. "
5194,2493864325,liked it,"There have been many ways over the years in which literature has found a path to deal with the Holocaust and its consequences, but a book about the inability to be able to read might not seem the most obvious. Yet in terms of attracting a mass audience, something that Schlink has clearly done, this German novel with illiteracy at its heart published back in the mid-90's, has been a phenomenon amongst readers. Bernhard Schlink's forth and easily most popular novel opens in post-war Germany when a teenage boy, Michael Berg (who also narrates), embarks on a love affair with a thirty-something woman, Hanna, who disappears, then years later turns up in the dock as a former concentration camp guard accused of the mass murder of Jewish women locked in a burning church. Michael, by now a law student observing the trial, realises that Hanna is a secret illiterate, a fact that has profoundly affected her actions in the past as well as fatally undermining her defence in court. Schlink says that writing about illiteracy ""was there when I started to think about the book. I did a great deal of research into it, but I never had an objective beyond telling that story. I'm sure the things I think about and worry about in other contexts play into the stories I write. But I do not know how they do that, and I'm really uninterested in the epistemology of my writing."" The theme certainly chimes, in terms of dramatically echoing the Third Reich's moral illiteracy, but the way the book has been enthusiastically taken up and used almost as documentary points to an impact that has far exceeded Schlink's immediate narrative ambitions.The hapless Hanna, conscientiously unscrupulous in the performance of her labor-camp duties, committed crimes against humanity, obviously. But what of the young law student who denies her his word, his aid? The paralyzing shame, the psychic numbing, the moral failures of the lucky late-born are the novel's central focus. Nazi holdovers in postwar Germany are denounced only at the margins of the story, so to speak. But this oblique approach has its own power. In one quietly disturbing scene, Michael visits the nearest concentration camp, Struthof, in Alsace that had a sign on it indicating that it had been a gas chamber. But Schlink spares his readers the sickening details. Literature is not only a bridge between the generations, sometimes it may get closer to the truth of recent history than benumbed eyewitness accounts. But this redemptive magic has its limits. Substituting great books for human contact is a cowardly dodge. At the novel's somber conclusion, Michael betrays Hanna yet again. On Hanna though, if one would call this more holocaust literaturethan a legal thriller with sex in it, then criticism of the book, from people who treat it as Holocaust literature, are right to say that Schlink doesn't come to a proper judgment of Hanna. Schlink acknowledges that he has been criticised for not unambiguously condemning Hanna. Is this fair? I think his novel can be open to so many interpretations. Guess that's part of it's appeal. All this aside, I just found the novel top to bottom rather bland. It brings up many questions, yes, and for the most part it at least held my curiosity. But seeing that it sold in huge numbers I expected much more. Maybe it's shortish length didn't help, it felt like not enough pages are actually given to alluding as to the true horrors of Hanna's crimes and the rest of it is simply the diatribe and musings of a teenage boy. Maybe I am missing the point? As books about the legacy of the holocaust go, there are much better ones out there than this. I will also say I much preferred the film over the book. With Kate Winslet giving a tour-de-force performance as Hanna."

Además, ¿no es más interesante abrir un libro sin saber lo que te vas a encontrar en su interior? ¿Dejarte llevar hacia donde él quiera conducirte? Pues bien, he de decir que esta lectura me ha gustado y sorprendido a partes iguales: he disfrutado con el amor de Michael por Hanna, y cuestionado el pasado de ella. Y al final, supongo, los he perdonado y entendido a los dos."

5194,355071530,really liked it,"There are certain books which have an impact on one, without one being able to put one's finger exactly on the reason why. 'The Reader' by Bernhard Schlink is such a book.The experience of reading this book was like taking a train ride through a pleasant landscape: you mosey along comfortably, enjoying the view and the climate, settled and relaxed. The journey is comfortable enough without being anything out of the ordinary. Then suddenly, the train enters a section of the countryside which is breathtaking in its beauty, and you are jolted out of your somnolence. You sit up and watch, your nose glued to the window, watching with rapt attention. You are unaware of the journey's passing, of temporal time, so engrossed are you in the present experience.The tale of 15-year-old Michael Berg (the first-person narrator) and thirty-something Hanna Schmidt, a tram conductor in post WW-2 Germany is pretty sordid in the beginning; having collapsed from hepatitis in front of her house, he is taken care of and helped home by her. Michael's thank-you visit to Hanna after convalescing, however, becomes a voyeuristic session and it's not long before they are lovers. It is an adolescent's fantasy come true, a bit like Lolita in reverse.The tale takes on a different twist once Michael starts reading to Hanna. Apparently, she can't get enough of his stories. So their sexual escapades are now connected to prolonged reading sessions which each one of them enjoys. But Hanna still remains an enigma to Michael with her erratic behaviour, an enigma which becomes all the more inexplicable when she disappears on the threshold of her promotion as tram driver.The next time he sees her, she is in the dock. Hanna is charged as a Nazi war criminal, a guard of a small concentration camp near Cracow, a satellite camp for Auschwitz. She is accused, along with others, of causing the death of a group of camp inmates by locking them up in a burning church. As a law student, Michael is covering her trial. Hanna's strange, self-destructive behaviour in the courtroom as well as her unusual acts as the camp guard (providing vulnerable young inmates with special status in the camp, to read books to her, until they were sent to Auschwitz to their death) intrigue him. One day, linking it to their sex-cum-reading sessions, he makes a startling discovery about his one-time lover...Later on, Michael is a disillusioned middle-aged man, with a failed marriage and a colourless life. He finds that he cannot exorcise Hanna from his psyche. At the end of his tether, he hits upon a unique solution: Michael finds solace for himself, as well as redemption for Hanna, through his old medium - that of reading.***Ultimately, what is this book about? Is it about paedophilia, or an adolescent fantasy? Is it about Nazism, and man's cruelty towards man? Is it the tale of a Germany coming to terms with its Nazi past, disguised as a coming-of-age story?I, personally, would like to see it as an allegory on the redemptive power of storytelling. In all cultures, bards enjoyed a special, revered status - in India, it approaches the divine (think of Vyasa and Valmiki). Here, Hanna's sins - both the carnal as well as the homicidal - are linked with getting stories read to her; so, unusually, is her redemption in the last part of the book.Hanna Schmidt is a masterly creation. In the short span of 200+ pages, the author has brought to life an engrossing character who remains a puzzle until the very end. This is one holocaust story which does not take the trodden path."
5194,17749640,did not like it,"This book just fell short with me, on oh so many levels. One thing that did intrigue me and that I have not yet seen much of is the perspective of Germans after the Holocaust and their views on the Third Reich and Hitler's agenda, especially of the younger generation of that time. That was really the only thing that struck me about this book. The rest was just not enough. For one, the affair between MIchael and Hanna was deplorable. Is it supposed to not be as bothersome because it is an older woman with a teenage boy, rather than an older man with a teenage girl? Either way, in my opinion, it's just not palatable and I felt neither sympathy for either of the characters nor did I feel that it was relatable on many levels at all whatsoever. The writing fell flat for me and was rather dry. Not in the beautiful sparse language trends of Hemingway, but in an annoying succinct manner that just left each situation as it occurred ""as is"" with nothing left to ponder. I noticed that this novel has won awards and while it means absolutely nothing to me because her choices are not always great or even good in the least, but it was on Oprah's Book Club list a number of years back. Neither are good enough reasons for anyone to read this book, in my opinion. Spare yourselves and read a nice historical account of Germany after the Holocaust, if you are inclined. I am sure it would be much richer reading in any case than this novel. "
5194,677288018,liked it,"An Intensely powerful story and I'm still thinking ""What do I do with this one??"" 15 year old Michael Berg becomes sick and suddenly meets Hanna Schmitz, a much older woman who lives in his neighborhood. She helps him and they begin a relationship. He reads to her, and the intimacy is so strong that I'm not even sure how I should feel about it. It feels real and raw, and dripping in lust, while at the same time, it feels wrong, and I'm left feeling something hollow and wondering if the moral question is bigger than the reality.Fast forward and Michael Berg finds himself on a panel listening to a court case against SS soldiers during WWII, and who should happen to walk onto the stand-- but Hanna Schmitz. Their relationship is complex and detailed. So many emotions and thoughts cross my mind, and at the end of the book, I'm still not sure how I should feel."
5194,2118546093,liked it,"I thought this was an interesting (if not somewhat disturbing) story, but not one that particularly blew me away. The questions of morality and complicity are intriguing as well; probably my favorite parts of the story where Michael's recollections of his experiences and trying to make sense of which were good, how he should feel about them in hindsight, etc. Glad I finally read this because it is so famous but not one that I'm in love with."

«Quería tener sitio en mi interior para ambas cosas: la comprensión y la condena. Pero las dos cosas al mismo tiempo no podían ser.»
Es muy interesante este libro. Está ambientado en Alemania, pocos años después del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y tiene un ritmo que va variando durante las tres partes en las que está dividido. Si bien al principio puede no parecer más que una historia juvenil de descubrimiento sexual, al ir transcurriendo el tiempo dentro de la vida del protagonista y narrador, va ganando una profundidad y complejidad filosófica/psicológica que lo vuelve, como ya dije, muy interesante.Una gran porción de 
El lector
 está dedicada a la relación (creo que unilateralmente) amorosa de Michael con Hanna. La peculiaridad es que él es un chico de 15 años y ella una mujer de 36 de la que se enamorará, y con la que pronto iniciará una relación donde se complementará lo físico con horas de lectura en voz alta.No se puede decir que esta primer parte del libro sea erótica, creo que sería mas apropiado definirla como sensual. No hay descripciones gráficas salvo algún que otro comentario aislado, y la mayor parte de sus encuentros son sencillos y casi mundanos. A pesar de ser el recuerdo de los ojos maravillados de un chico de 15 años, el narrador ya es adulto y quizás sea por eso que los describe como un «ritual de lectura, ducha, amor y reposo».No puedo decir que me haya gustado esta relación. No es sólo por la diferencia de edades y maduración, sino por la manera en que ella lo trata. Hanna es dada a la manipulación psicológica, a la humillación y a los rechazos, teniéndolo constantemente temeroso de perderla si la contraría.Pero ésto no es lo más importante de la historia.La verdad es que ahora que lo terminé siento que toda esa parte de la adolescencia de Michael no fue otra cosa sino una larga introducción para lo que viene después. Años más tarde va a reencontrarse accidentalmente con Hanna y descubrirá algo horrible de su pasado que lo cambia todo. Está en la sinopsis así que por desgracia no me sorprendió, pero no por eso deja de ser un muy buen giro.A partir de este punto el libro cambia por completo. Se vuelve muchísimo más profundo y la narración toma una voz más madura y filosófica, demostrando lo bien que puede escribir el autor. Aborda además el dilema que aqueja a la sociedad alemana al tener que ver con ojos realistas y condenatorios los crímenes que cometieron personas que aman, cuenta con detalle sobre la vida en algunos campos de concentración y exterminio, y se introduce de a ratos en un análisis entre filosófico y sociológico que personalmente me resultó muy interesante.Ya cerca del final del libro fue el único momento en que sentí pena y simpatía por Hanna. Ella tiene un secreto (que salta a la vista leyendo un poquito entre líneas al principio) que la avergüenza y que la lleva a tomar decisiones muy erradas. El sentimiento de vergüenza está muy presente en toda la historia en diferentes contextos, y es muchas veces lo que motiva los cambios.Ésta es una historia dramática que va tomando más y más peso a medida que avanzan los breves capítulos, y que llevará a un final esperable pero inesperado. Es una muy buena opción para leer algo corto y rápido pero cargado de contenido, tanto literario como humano.Reseña de Fantasía Mágica"
5194,64943893,it was amazing,"This is not a book that I wanted to read. So many times while reading books about the Holocaust, I feel a disconnectedness from the events. It's a mixture of two things. The first is that the sheer scope of events is just too large, too horrific, for one person's words to do justice to it. The second, and this could partly be due to the first problem, is that I detest being manipulated by my books. With a lot of Holocaust literature the villains are stock characters; the malevolent Colonel with no humanity, staring cold-eyed at the prisoners before sending them off to their deaths. I find this to be a drastic over-simplification of the tragedy and one with a great potential for allowing such a dehumanizing event to occur again. It's simple to hate Count Dracula or Emperor Palpatine. They have no identity aside from their thirst for power and willingness to inflict any cruelty for any whim. They are a delightfully uncomplicated type, divorced from standard concepts of morality- purely evil. Nazis, quite understandably, get tarred in this same way. We see the pictures of bodies stacked hundreds of feet high at Bergen-Belsen, the haunted eyes staring out past barbed wire, the jackboots marching in lockstep, The Triumph of the Will- these are all images etched into the collective memory. No civilized person could do such a thing, the mind recoils. These are not people but demons brought to Earth. This is a phenomenal disservice to those who suffered so horrifically at their hands. How can we properly work to prevent such a travesty from ever occurring again when we choose to reject these people from the human community? We need to understand what can move someone to such a place that pushing the button to fill a shower with Zyklon B is just another day at the office. We need to see how easy it is to give in to what Hannah Arendt dubbed the ""banality of evil."" To recognize those aspects within ourselves and then to strive to work against them constantly. Allowing Nazis to become human in our mind does not excuse any of the crimes they committed. Rather it opens us up to the understanding that the same potential exists in all of us. When we understand this, that we all have the capability of becoming something monstrous simply through acquiescing to the dominant trends in society, by going with the flow, only then can we truly make strides in guaranteeing the truth of the mantra ""Never Again."" And it is easy, this acquiescence. It is as easy as taking a new job to avoid having a shameful secret found out at an old one. The next thing you know you're guarding prisoners at a work camp. From there, it's just another small step to selecting who gets shipped back to Auschwitz and who stays. The option for rebellion doesn't even raise its head; either you do the task or someone else will, raise a fuss and you may just find yourself on the train with them. Next step you find yourself standing outside a flaming church, hundreds of women locked inside and, though you have a key, you do nothing simply because nobody told you to and to release the women would mean to set them free (which was definitely verboten). That's all it takes. A simple abdication of responsibility and 300 women cook within the stone walls. Please believe, understanding does not equal forgiveness. It does not mean you have to like that person one iota, but an effort should be made to see how such things are possible- how each decision moved them further and further down the road to the Nuremberg Tribunal. Yet, as Schlink's main character, Hanna Schmitz, asks in especially gripping moment, ""What would you have done?"" How do you get off that merry-go-round when its already spinning? Delightfully, the author does not hand the reader a satisfactory answer, for what possible answer could there be?The book was not all death, doom and gloom. That's just the bit that struck me the hardest, because the author built such an affinity between myself and Hanna. Seduction via literature has to be my favorite thing ever and the early scenes where this takes place were some of the most tightly coiled eroticism I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Later, when the scope of what Hanna has done becomes clear, the reader, much like the young narrator, must reconcile his affection for her with these revelations. It's a struggle, to be sure, but one that helps make The Reader one of the most impacting books I've yet read."
5194,784624658,it was amazing,"If Hanna’s illiteracy was used by the author as a metaphor to portray the ignorance that allowed an entire generation to perpetrate, or, at least, to comply with the crimes of WWII? I’m not so sure about it. After all, the germans were not more ignorant than other people at the time. Far from it. My hypothesis is that Hanna’s illiteracy represents the inability of reading behind daily events and interpreting their possible consequences, which may sometimes be catastrophic. For Hanna, there was nothing wrong on being a SS guard in a concentration camp. It was part of her job, as it was for thousands of others. Allegedly, they were just following the law of the time and did not dare to reflect if it was right or wrong. As people hardly ever do, at all times. The illiteracy means the absence of the power to question and to confront, a sort of numbness we feel as we follow a tedious daily routine.Hanna learned to read with Michael’s tapes. Michael read Hanna romances, but also books on ethics and moral. Therefore, she also learned with him to interpret her own life and found out her own responsibility in what happened to prisoners sent to Auschwitz. She learned further about it reading books about concentration camps.That also happened to the generation who lived during the war and took part on it. They only realized the magnitude of their doings as the war was over, as the Allies found the piles of bodies in camps, published their photos in newspapers and as germans faced their accusators.Before Hanna was released, she realized that she would not find forgiveness and understanding outside. Not even from the one who had loved her, what brought her to suicide.By the way, one thing I like about the film that is not on the book is the last scene, where Michael decides to tell his daughter the role Hanna played in his life. It represents the process of struggling to come to terms with the past (that has even a specific word in german: Vergangenheitsbewältigung!). In Germany I have seen many parents in memorials to jews and museums telling their children who Hitler was and that what he did was wrong. It is relieving to find out that they have learned that only open dialogue and discussion about what happened can avoid it from happening again. And also help people to come to terms with it.Great reading!"
5194,39277778,really liked it,"Whenever a film is coming out that is based on an acclaimed book, I try to read the book first (knowing that the reverse order almost never happens for me). The Reader is the latest such circumstance, and I'm glad I made the time for this quick read. The book centers on the reflections of a man who, as a teenager in post WW-II Germany, had a passionate love affair with a reticent and mysterious older woman. Mere months later, she disappears from his life. The rest of the book explains why, and the impact this revelation has on the main character. Schlink writes beautifully simple, declarative prose that is shorn of pretense. The Reader envelops us in the painfully bittersweet and conflicted memories of a man whose lover turns out to be a mirage, and the resulting guilt he feels regarding their relationship, as it existed both before and after he learns about her shameful past. This relationship is purposefully symbolic to represent for Schlink the complicated feelings of second generation Germans about the horrific legacy of the Holocaust, as perpetrated in varying degrees by their very own loved ones. Schlink adroitly raises the many thorny issues raised by this sensitive subject, and equally skillfully leaves the narrative open for his readers to puzzle over them, just as his sad, sympathetic narrator must as well."
5194,2058154027,really liked it,"**This review contains spoilers since what I have to say about this book can't be expressed without revealing details. If you haven't read this book and wish to, you should stop reading now...**If I had read this book, 'The Reader' by Bernhard Schlink a decade ago, I would have felt much differently about it than I do reading it now. This book, a thin volume at just 218 pages, presents moral situations or dilemmas which invite the reader to consider his own feelings and beliefs. I am much less rigid in my views now than I was even a decade ago. This story occurs in post-World War II Germany and centers around 15-year-old Michael Berg and a woman names Hanna Schmitz. On his way home from school one day, Michael became violently ill while on the street. As fate would have it, Hanna Schmitz was nearby and helped Michael get back to his home. Michael was ill with hepatitis for quite some time but when he began to feel better, he sought out Hanna to thank her for her assistance. Michael and Hanna.. a woman more than twice his age.. began a sexual relationship, creating the first of several dilemmas in this story. Although I personally did not find this aspect of the story romantic or erotic, given my understanding of adolescent hormones and adult loneliness, I wasn't at all surprised by the development of this relationship. Putting moral issues aside and looking at this relationship from a reasonable and logical viewpoint, a relationship with a person who never calls you by your given name but simply 'kid' is probably an omen. Also, any relationship which is secret is never a healthy one. secrets isolate the people involved from family, friends and peers... so this relationship, to me, was doomed from the outset. And as I expected, one day, Hanna simply disappeared.. leaving Michael with no explanation but with plenty of guilt. he couldn't stop wondering if he had done something which forced her to leave. Michael had no way of knowing it at the time but Hanna was on the run, not from him but to conceal certain truths about herself. It was years later that Michael saw Hanna again. By this time, he was studying law and his education was coinciding with Nazi War Crimes trials occurring in various towns. Michael's law seminar was encouraged to attend a trial which was taking place in a neighboring town. The students and professors would be following the trial of a group of women camp guards. The law students were ambitious in their agenda and relentless in discovering the truth. They were interested in defining.. ""What IS law? Is it what is on the books, or what is actively enacted and obeyed in society?"" What was occurring in Germany at that time was that the younger generation was examining and discussing the crimes perpetrated during World War II so that they could discover the degree of guilt and responsibility which should be assigned to their elders. I should mention that what the students were doing was not particularly popular nor was it welcomed by some people in society. The trials being held didn't hold much interest for some and ""literally repelled others."" I found this particular section of the story to be compelling and of great interest. I, of course, was not all that surprised by the citizens who wished to avoid these trials or who wanted to forget about what had happened. I was intrigued by the enthusiasm of the students who were determined to display all the facts.. withholding nothing... so that the responsibility and culpability of society could be determined. I suppose this can be explained as the zealotry that often characterizes youth. And of course, it was most likely difficult to avoid dealing with these issues completely when the country had been forced onto the world stage to account for war crimes.. crimes against humanity. But I couldn't help but think about Germany's reluctant assent to shine a light on the atrocities that had been committed and compare it to how the United States has typically handled the atrocities it has committed over the years. Usually, this country (the US) develops a sort of collective amnesia. Then we simply rewrite history so that it is clear to anyone who questions that we have a mandate bestowed upon us from God because we are an 'exceptional' or special people. It's definitely something to consider if you ever find yourself wanting to condemn the actions of another country....When Michael Berg walked into the courtroom, he immediately noticed Hanna Schmitz. Hanna had been one of the women camp guards and now she would be expected to account for her actions. The scene was highly dramatic and I could feel the pieces of the puzzle which had been Hanna Schmitz, begin to fall into place for Michael. Her behaviors... her reticence to talk about herself and her life.. began to make sense for the first time.But Hanna was holding tightly to one more secret... a secret she would rather die for than have it exposed to the world. Michael finally put the missing pieces together.. her running away, her inability to stay with any one job for long and even her recruitment by the Nazis to guard women prisoners at Auschwitz ... all of this had been to keep the fact that she was illiterate from the world. I have to admit that although the clues were there in the story, I had not guessed that Hanna's big secret was her illiteracy. Up until that big reveal, Hanna had not been a sympathetic nor an understandable character. But when I realized that she was illiterate, I couldn't help but feel compassion for her. Perhaps she was not deserving of compassion because any sympathy shown to her was far more than she had demonstrated to the women prisoners whose lives she controlled. But illiteracy has a personal meaning for me. Several years ago, after the death of a family member, our family discovered that this family member had been illiterate . He had been able to keep this secret through the diligence and aid from his wife for more than 50 years. It was a shocking revelation and all I could think about was the huge amount of energy he must have expended daily to hide this from his family, his co-workers.. from the world. His obvious shame and humiliation were all I could think about and it broke my heart. And Hanna's illiteracy... it was something I could not only imagine but feel a personal connection to. I believe Michael felt that sense of compassion for Hanna as well.. although he felt it wasn't an excuse for her actions. Instead of reporting this discovery to the judges, he allowed her to keep her secret.. even though it meant she would spend a much longer time in prison. Did Michael do the right thing? I think in realizing that allowing Hanna to maintain her privacy and dignity was more important than potentially having her prison sentence reduced. I have been thinking about this story a great deal.. even though I finished reading it days ago. To me, the story of Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz was not simply their singular, personal story. What occurred in their lives seemed somehow symbolic of the tragedy of a nation... of the world... tragic events which the entire world talks about, writes about and tries to make sense of more than seven decades later."
5194,2621651319,really liked it,"There will always be some substantial gaps among peoples. This gap, however, is not of caste or class or gender. It is the gap of shallowed empathetic experience. The Reader is about this gap. It is about the mystery of what something must have felt like and this 'something' in the book is Holocaust. Michael Berg, the narrator, is the 'second generation' of the Holocaust. His relationship with an older woman, one of the SS guards at the Nazi camp, is the relationship of the 'first generation' with the 'second'. The novel questions what the second generation would do. This question, like Hanna's question to the judge ("". . . so what would you have done?""), lingers and floats in mid-air.The novel is packed in many intricate and complex layers. It leaves many questions that will remain unanswered; at least, in my case, the questions are still wavering around. I have no hopes of ever finding any answer. As I said, there will always be the gaps of shallowed empathetic experience."
5194,304193450,really liked it,"The concept of love never ceases to amaze. From the cradle to the grave, a human being is guided,driven, motivated or annihilated because of it. Even when the presence of this feeling is what makes life tick for all humanity, we tend to call the romantic variant as 'falling in' love. This has always seemed ironical to me for if this feeling was as spiritually uplifting as it is believed to be, why don't we call it 'rising in' love ?Ah ! But I digress from the point here ! This book is fuelled by an affair. The love contained in the plot made me plod through the dusty attic of my mind from where the lines above clattered out. The plot centers around the affair of a younger man with an older woman. An affair ruled only by sex and sex alone. During the adolescent phase, the thoughts of love are always entwined with lust in the mind. Like copulating serpents they lie and it is a futile task trying to make out where one ends and the other begins. The journey of Michael Berg through the curves of Hanna Schmitz's anatomy is also one of self discovery for him. In the loss of innocence lies the keys to his future and he is at the verge of getting to those keys when the short and stormy affair blows out. The pain of withdrawal while at first unbearable, slowly becomes a dull ache. With the passage of years there comes a clinical detachment while seeing the ones we loved and lost long ago. The beauty of the language can be acutely felt when the author describes that memories of long ago stay behind like a city as a train pulls out of a station. The memories are there, behind you but in the passage of the train they disappear behind a bend in the track. The story changes lanes here and does a total flip and from a loved-and-lost tale, it becomes an intricately plotted tale of human morality and guilt. In a particular passage which depicts a court scene, I was reminded of a couple of lines from a Steig Larsson book  There are no innocents, only varying levels of guilt . Through those court room scenes we are asked the fundamental questions about morals and principles, about guilt and remorse, of crime and punishment and other such things.While you are made fully aware that the accused while not being fully innocent does not deserve what comes to them. To sum it all up, this is an extremely tragic tale.

5194,102037725,it was amazing,"The topic of the Holocaust is raised almost every day in some manner. Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, ""he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today"" and ""thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future."" Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in ""The Reader"". ""Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame"", his narrator and protagonist contemplates, ""but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it"".The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime. ""The Reader"", set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts in the context of his personal experiences. Like Schlink himself, he grapples with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations.Michael recounts the most important stages in his life, starting with experiences long passed in his youth. While his account follows the chronology of events, he progressively interleaves retrospective reflections on his past conduct, questioning his conflicting emotions - his behaviour. The story starts with Michael's first, secret, love affair at age 15 with a woman more than twice his age. The blossoming erotic relationship strengthens his self-worth and confidence yet, at the same time, increasingly isolating him from his family and peers. Hanna Schmitz, of whose circumstances and background Michael knew very little, was affectionate and standoffish at the same time, prone to abrupt mood swings. The young lover is completely captivated and eager to please. He is the ""Reader"", in German ""Vorleser"" is a person who reads aloud to an audience. At her insistence he reads his books to her and it becomes an important element of their shared intimacy. When she disappears one day without any warning, her loss leaves him devastated and scarred for life. He can only seek the reasons in his own actions. Seeing Hanna again years later and in unanticipated surroundings, triggers a flood of questions about the person he loved and thought he knew. Her behaviour raises many questions and Michael discovers a long secret that puts in doubt the facts as they are exposed. He also wrestles with himself over his own inaction when confronted with choices. ""What would you have done?"" Although addressed to the judge by the defendant, this question hangs over Michael, as it does over his whole generation. It encapsulates the primary dilemma of the child-parent generations relationships. Finally, writing the story of his life, drafting and redrafting it in his head until it is in a publishable form, is seen as a chance for his own recovery and for living his own life.The Reader, while a work of fiction, is deeply anchored in the personal experiences of the author and symbolic for his generation. His spare and unemotional language underlines the impression of a biographical investigation and is used quite deliberately. The English translation captures the tone and style amazingly well. Reading this book should not be an ""easy pleasure"" as some reviewers have suggested. The Reader covers difficult and complex terrain in a way that it forces the reader to reflect and question their own position long afterwards. Although written directly for a German audience of Schlink's and my generation, the novel, surprisingly, has attracted world-wide attention. While reviews and reactions among readers are highly diverse and even contradictory, it should be read by as many people as possible and with the care the subject matter deserves."

Filmi bu kadar etkilediyse kitabı da aynı şekilde etkileyecektir diye düşünerek okumaya başladım ve kitabı bir çırpıda bitirdiğimde yanılmadığımı anladım. Film esnasında kafamda soru işaretlerine sebep olan pek çok noktanın aydınlandığını, Hanna'yı ve Michael'ı çok daha iyi anladığımı söyleyebilirim. Kitap bence okuyucuyu zorlayan bir kitap. Akıcılık açısından bir zorlama değil bu, yarattığı çatışmalar sebebiyle bir zorlama. Hanna Schmitz'den belki de nefret etmek gerekiyor; ama bir şekilde yapamıyorsunuz, bir yerden sonra anlamaya bile başlıyorsunuz. Hani diyorlar ya ""sempati değil, empati"" diye, benim yaşadığım da tam olarak bu oldu. Bundan hemen önce Kötülüğün Sıradanlığı'nı okumuştum (aslında akabinde Okuyucu'yu okumayı da bu neden tercih ettim) ve Hanna bana yer yer Adolf Eichmann'ı anımsattı. Bundan sonrası spoiler olabilir, şimdiden uyarayım:Hanna, okuma yazma bilmeyen bir kadın ve bu durumdan dolayı da büyük bir utanç duyuyor. Bunu gizlemek için her şeyi yapmaya razı. Siemens'te çalışırken terfi etmek üzereyken sırf okuma yazma bilmediği anlaşılmasın diye SS'e katılıyor. Sırf okuyup yazamadığını belli etmemek için mahkemede bir yerden sonra kendisini savunmak yerine kendisine yüklenen suçlara razı oluyor. Bunun yanı sıra ""görev bilinci"" fazla yüksek bir kadın Hanna. Yaptığı doğru mu yanlış mı düşünmüyor bile. Tıpkı Adolf Eichamnn'ın iddia ettiği gibi kendisine gelen emirler var ve bunu sorgulayamayacağına inanıyor. Ne kadar canice olsa da her şartta kurallara uymaya çalışıyor. Şunu sorup durdum okurken: Peki neden? Bu utancı, yaptığı caniliklere bir gerekçe olarak gösterilebilir mi? Elbette hayır. Peki neden tam olarak öfkelenemiyoruz Hanna'ya, neden tam olarak nefret edemiyoruz ondan? Hanna dışındaki kadınlara daha az cezalar verilirken Hanna'nın ömür boyu hapse mahkûm edilmesiyle adalet gerçekten yerine gelmiş oluyor mu? Olmuyorsa neden o kadar duruşma yapıldı? Ayrıca kilisede pek çok kadını cayır cayır yanmaya terk eden sadece SS görevlileri miydi? Neden köyden kimse yardım etmeye yeltenmedi? Neden kimse onları suçlamıyor? Bu kötülükleri yapan çoğu insanın Yahudilere karşı özel bir nefreti yok. Yaptıklarından ne zevk alıyorlar ne de onlardan pişmanlık duyuyorlar. Peki neden yaptılar bunu zamanında? Günümüzde bu tür ""eziyetler"" bitti mi? ""... ne emirden ne itaatten söz ediyorum. Celladın yaptığı emirleri yerine getirmek değildir. İşini yapar o, astığı insanlardan nefret etmez, onlardan intikam almaz, yoluna çıktıları, kendisini tehdit ettikleri ya da saldırdıkları için öldürmez onları. O insanlar celladın umurunda bile değildir. Öylesine umursamaz ki, öldürebilir de öldürmeyebilir de"" (s. 131).Okurken çok fazla soru sordum kendime; ama sanırım bunların büyük çoğunluğunu yanıtlayamadım. Dediğim gibi filmi beğeniyle izlemiştim kitabı da çok severek okudum. "

5194,1747686817,it was amazing,"Aside from throwing light on lesser known post-war ramifications of the Nazi regime, this short, compact book surprised me with the number of moral, ethical and behavioral conundrums that it posed. These conundrums, if explored do not lead to answers but might lead to a sense of improved understanding - an understanding that is not limited to Nazi crimes, but can be applied to a whole host of mass crimes and post-war genocides where exploration isn't even an option. Bernhard Schlink's prose is spare and austere, not even a single sentence is wasted in building any unnecessary or irrelevant imagery or dialogue. So altogether the book does make a sound impact in the short time it takes one to read it.Couldn't resist watching the movie after reading it, and I'd say its one of those rare movies that are rendered from the book with remarkably high fidelity. And needless to say Kate Winslet aced it! "
5194,2189108914,liked it,"Borrowed as an audiobook through Overdrive.The Reader is a story about Michael Berg, who is a boy at the start of the story and Hanna Schmitz a trolly conductor living in postwar Berlin. A relationship develops between the two characters that become intimate in a lengthy relationship. There are struggles in the relationship with Hanna taking charge and at times acting a bit irrational. She leaves suddenly and the next time Michael sees her he is law school and she is on trial. Hanna hides two secrets from Michael and the reader although the reader will easily pick up on the first secret and the second one takes only a little thought considering the setting. The writing is sparse as a story told by memory would likely be. It held my attention, but some of that may have been wanting to see if I was right in my thoughts about the secrets."
5194,2143011490,it was amazing,"--an edition with images from the 2008 movie, The Reader (which I haven't seen), with Kate Winslett in the character of Hanna Schmitz and Ralph Fiennes as Michael BergWhen I was in my early 20s, I fell in love with somebody I could not have, that is, he was not the marrying kind. After a while a friend of mine, a slightly older contemporary, told me that man I loved was bisexual, which ended my attraction, just like that. I wasn't repulsed--nothing like that; but the bond was broken. I had another female friend, a fellow graduate student, who had an affair with the head of the facility where we both were doing our internships. She broke off with her boyfriend, for how could someone her same age compete with the attentions of the powerful established male? Subsequently, she never married, never had children.Those affairs in academia between male professors and female students have only recently come to be considered wrong--an abuse of power. Think Arendt and Heidegger, or even Abelard and Heloise. (Yes I know he got in big trouble, but it was for damaging Heloise's uncle's property, not for sexually abusing a person in his custody.) In my own situation, the young man was my same age, possibly a factor. And I never even found out for sure if he were really bisexual. But in any case, not all romantic attraction ends when the object of affection turns out to be unsuitable. Think of the movie The Crying Game, in which Stephen Rea's character maintained some sort of fixation on Jaye Davidson's character, even after he found out all was not as it had seemed.--Stephen Rea and Jaye Davidson in The Crying Game, 1992Sometimes, who one loves, or, maybe, who one becomes imprinted on, is unaccountable. But the impact--in these cases, the distorting impact--is real. Not to mention the impact of history and context within which our loves and attachments are set. What a complicated scenario this book describes: the consequences of wrongness along multiple dimensions, through and through.You could tell from the title that this book is about reading:I began with the Odyssey. I read it after Gertrud and I had separated. There were many nights when I couldn't sleep for more than a few hours; I would lie awake, and when I switched on the light and picked up a book, my eyes closed, and when I put the book down and turned off the light, I was wide awake again. So I read aloud, and my eyes didn't close. And because in all my confused half-waking thoughts that swirled in tormenting circles of memories and dreams around my marriage and my daughter and my life, it was always Hanna who predominated, I read to Hanna. I read to Hanna on tape....In general I read to Hanna the things I wanted to read myself at any given moment. With the Odyssey, I found at first that it was hard to take in as much when I read aloud as when I read silently to myself. But that changed. The disadvantage of reading aloud remained the fact that it took longer. But books read aloud also stayed long in my memory. Even today, I can remember things in them absolutely clearly.Also, it's about writing:When I began writing myself, I read these pieces aloud to her as well. I waited until I had dictated my handwritten text, and revised the typewritten version, and had the feeling that now it was finished. When I read it aloud, I could tell if the feeling was right or not. And if not, I could revise and record a new version over the old. But I didn't like doing that. I wanted to have my reading be the culmination. Hanna became the court before which once again I concentrated all my energies, all my creativity, all my critical imagination. After that, I could send the manuscript to the publisher."
5194,122514591,really liked it,"ETA: I am a bit of a perfectionist. I wanted to make sure I hadn't missed some detail, so I listened to parts two and three again. It was not boring listening a second time; the writing is beautiful and there is so much to ponder. It is about the holocaust so do not expect an easy, light read! It is about second generation Germans and how they view their parents and their actions during the war. This is done with both honesty and humility; it is an important issue to address. The central topic remains the role shame and guilt play in people's lives. *****************I listened to ""The Reader"" in a hypo (low blood sugar) all afternoon. I know everything that happened, and I cannot decide if I should re-listen to the whole dam thing. It is not disgusting, like I thought it would be. The boy and the woman LOVE each other. You don't think about the age difference. It has great lines that make you think. The sexual relationship is simply part of two people reaching out to each other. This book is about guilt and shame and what it will push people to do. I think this book will appeal to people that seem strong, but in fact are quite insecure. It will appeal to people who are ashamed of their own inadequacies. They will relate to the boy/man and the woman. It is also about the guilt Germans feel after WW2. I am very glad I read this book. No, I listened to it. Good narration by Campbell Scott."
5194,29755865,it was ok,"When I first saw this book at the thrift-store months ago, I thought to myself that it had to be amazing. The cover image intrigued me, I'm interested in reading books that pertain to the Holocaust, and at only 218 pages, it's short so I felt sure that it would pack a punch. The first part interested me, due to the fact that I felt the book was leading up to something really dramatic and exciting, but I never felt that spark that makes a book great. Everything felt a bit rushed, and matter-of-fact, and almost scripted. The beginning of Hanna and Michael's affair was so abrupt that it seemed unnatural. The second part, which should have really interested me, as it's the part that dealt with the majority of the Holocaust issues, was interesting only because of Hanna's actions. Her secret wasn't really a revelation to me, as I had suspected it for quite a while. The third part was boring to me. Michael annoyed me in his alienation from others, and his refusal to accept other women as they are and instead tries to make them fit into this ideal Hanna-mold that Hanna herself didn't even fit. It felt to me that he gave up living after his affair with Hanna deteriorated, just as he had given up against her so many times while they were together. Hanna was the star, and Michael was responsible for the stage-dressing and supporting roles. One thing that irritated me throughout the story was Michael's inability to remember the things that he wants to tell us about. I understand that most people do not have 100% recall, but I counted at least 5 examples of where he would try to describe what he couldn't remember. This just seemed so lazy to me. Like the author expects the reader (meaning us) to do all the work of imagining the scenario for him, so that he does not have to give it life of its own. I suppose that some will say that Michael's inability to remember everything makes the story more real, but I just kept thinking what a cheat it was. This was an OK book. I'd recommend it if I thought that the person would really enjoy it, but I myself felt disappointed by it over all. "
5194,1550187480,really liked it,"Before saying anything else,let me say I loved the writing style. Though i didn't like the 1st part (romance and all that) In fact I regrettedwhat I have started Why I have longed this to read? But I remain patient & keep on reading and with every passing chapter it gets better. Part 2 was good& part 3 was brilliant From Ch 10 to onwards of part 3, every page was remarkable, break my heart 💔 & what an unexpected ending.It made me weep,made me feel sad& completely indulge me in the emotions."
5194,144989062,really liked it,"The Reader by Bernhard Schlink is a sparsely written novel that still has great storytelling power. I haven't read a lot of Holocaust fiction, although it is an area that I am (perhaps morbidly) interested in, so of course this book appealed. I had previously seen the film, but it was several years ago so my memory of certain plot points was a little fuzzy. However, this book is so brilliantly told and paced that I was immediately brought back into the world and time period.The book is a parable, narrated by Michael Berg, who now in his adult years reflects on his relationship as a 15 year old with a 36 year old tram conductor Hanna Schmitz. This relationship shaped his personality and his tastes for years to come, even into adulthood, and is brought to a head once again when as a young law student, he finds that Hanna is on trial for her work as an SS guard at Auschwitz during the war.The chapters are short but don't feel snappy and don't speed up the pace. Rather, Schlink does not need overly flowery language or pages and pages to tell his story, instead presenting the bare bones of everything. I loved this simplistic style, as not only was it incredibly easy to read but it also helped communicate some of the numbness that Michael Berg felt over the years, particularly in the court room scene. As a law professional, both Berg (and the author) had a very clear cut way of dealing with things which I really enjoyed.There is a lot of philosophical and reflective content in this book, and deals a great deal with the guilt that young Germans felt in the aftermath of a war that their parents were involved with, either for good or for bad. The book dealt with the feeling of shame that many people at the time felt, and how they dealt with it (or didn't deal with it). This book would benefit from a re-read at some point to properly engage with the content that is a little more apart from the central plot.I would highly recommend this book if you want a simple but arresting read, or are a fan of WW2 themed fiction. I would also highly recommend the movie afterwards!"

Μία σχέση μπορεί να σε στιγματίσει κι ίσως και να ξεφεύγει από τον έλεγχο σου. Ίσως ακόμη να την ξεχνάς, αλλά θα είναι πάντα εκεί να σου θυμίζει την ύπαρξη της, «Οι κύκλοι της ζωής μας είναι τόσο κοντά ο ένας στον άλλον, που στα κατοπινά συναντούμε πάντα τα περασμένα, όχι σαν πεπραγμένα και τελειωμένα αλλά παρόντα και ζωντανά».

Και κλείνοντας με ακόμη ένα απόσπασμα του βιβλίου, «Γιατί κάτι που υπήρξε ωραίο θρυμματίζεται στην ανασκόπηση, επειδή έκρυβε άσχημες αλήθειες; [...] Μερικές φορές η ανάμνηση κάνει απιστίες στην ευτυχία κι αυτό συμβαίνει, όταν το τέλος υπήρξε οδυνηρό»."

5194,2566743701,it was amazing,"‘The Reader’ (1997) by Bernhard Schlink – translated from the original German version by Carol Brown Janeway. This is an important, compelling, thought-provoking and at times a consciously and intentionally uncomfortable read.Schlink’s novel is a story of three distinct, but more or less chronological, parts: The first part of ‘Reader’ initially provides us with a relatively straightforward and somewhat traditional story of a relationship between a very young man – Michael, and a significantly older woman – Hanna. This is a relationship that is difficult, erotic, intense, challenging but certainly a very believable one. This initial story of Michael and Hanna could in itself have provided the sole focus, content and full extent of another, very different novel – but not ‘The Reader’, which is so much more than that story alone. As such, whilst entirely pivotal to the rest of the novel, the story of Michael and Hanna’s first meeting and their initial relationship, is just that – the first part, the prelude to what is to yet come.Part two of Schlink’s novel is all about the events concerning and following the discovery of very uncomfortable truths in respect of Hanna’s past life. This part of the book is very different from the first, in mood as well as content.The final part of ‘The Reader’ could be described as perhaps the aftermath – it is about the comparatively later years in the story that is both Michael and Hanna’s – the final denouement and conclusion as it were.‘The Reader’ is a very fine book and an important one. On one level Schlink’s book could feasibly be read merely as the story of the (albeit life-changing) relationship shared between Michael and Hanna, along with its subsequent aftermath. But beyond that surface story is the story of a country, a people confronting their past; it’s about collective guilt – the guilt of one generation confronting and attempting to come to terms with the wrongs of the past, the wrongs perpetrated by previous generations. This is a novel that is about acknowledging and attempting to come to terms with the past – to reconcile the wrongs of the past with the present – on both and individual and a societal level. So in one sense, ‘The Reader’ is about society and history attempting to heal itself; on the other, it is a very up close and personal story of two individuals. On whichever and on both levels – this novel is all about love, secrets, power, confrontation, guilt, acknowledging past wrongs, forgiveness and striving for absolution. ‘The Reader’ is all about the wrongs that we do; it’s about learning from the past and it’s about healing in whatever way we can and ultimately – it’s about hope.Bernhard Schlink's novel 'The Reader' is a very fine and an important book - highly recommended and not to be missed. "
5194,33262872,did not like it,"I'll start my review by telling you that I have not seen the movie based on this book - I thought I wanted to, but now I don't really see the appeal.15 year-old Michael Berg becomes ill on his way home from school one day and is rescued by Hanna Schmitz, a streetcar conductor more than twice his age. When he is well again, he seeks out Frau Schmitz and becomes her lover. Michael eventually spends more time with friends from school and feels as if he is betraying his relationship with Hanna, and they understandably begin to drift apart. Then one day, Hanna completely disappears from his life. The next time he sees her, he is a young law student, and Hanna is on trial for crimes she committed as a prison guard at Auschwitz. As Hanna attempts to defend herself (badly,) Michael realizes that see is harboring a secret she feels is even more shameful than her crimes as part of the Third Reich.I was on a wait-list for weeks at my library to get my hands on this book. I had high hopes when I began reading, but in the end, I was disappointed. The writing fell extremely flat, and it simply failed to engage me in the story. The entire novel read like a story outline - what happened to the meat? The plot was full of promise that was never delivered. It was so dry and thin, it's only real virtue being the fact that I was able to read it really quickly.I felt nothing for the characters - they were shallow, and I did not care at all what happened to them. There was no development of any of the characters, and they seemed as flat as cardboard cut-outs. The relationship between Michael and Hanna that so many people call ""erotic"" and ""romantic"", I found to be superficial at best. I felt no emotional pull between the main characters - they were cold and unfeeling on the pages, and left me with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.I really wish I had chosen another book for my reading challenge. I feel cheated by The Reader, as if it was a complete waste of my time. It was very simplistic and redundant. I kept waiting for the plot to thicken, and SPOILER ALERT - it never did! I cannot recommend this one to anyone, so read at your own risk."
5194,1884911771,liked it,"Este era daqueles livro que não tinha grande curiosidade em ler mas aqui há uns tempos vi a opinião da Dora e despertou-me algum interesse. Michael Berg é uma jovem de 15 anos que inicia uma relação com Hanna Schmitz, 21 anos mais velha. Ao longo desta relação, criam um ritual: primeiro tomam banho, depois Michael lê para Hanna e por fim fazem sexo. Mas esta relação, termina abrupta, quando Hanna desaparece subitamente.Passado alguns anos, Michael está a acompanhar um julgamento de ex-guardas, femininas, dos campos de concentração e eis que uma das mulheres é Hanna. Para já, não considero que seja uma história de amor. Vi Hanna como uma mulher fria e manipuladora, que se aproveitou de um jovem, que acabou por marcar a vida de Michael. É certo que achei que Michael amava Hanna e que, na altura, sentiu-se mais confiante. E fiquei com a sensação que esta relação lhe causou alguns danos emocionais. Achei ainda o segredo de Hanna demasiado previsível.Gostei do tipo de escrita, muito pessoal e sentimental. A forma como Michael nos dá a conhecer as suas emoções, como nos descreve o que lhe acontece. Mas realmente, em termos de história, não me agradou.Julguei que fosse um livro que falasse mais sobre o holocausto, nomeadamente do ponto de vista alemão e dos guardas, mas achei também que abordou o assunto de forma muito superficial. Percebo que o objectivo foi explorar a relação da Hanna e do Michael, mas poderia ter sido um assunto mais desenvolvida.Apesar de ser um livro pequeno e que se lê rapidamente, ao longo de praticamente toda a história, não senti qualquer emoção, apenas o final me surpreendeu."

5194,1698259981,liked it,"I decided to pick this book up and read it simply because I had heard some pretty decent things about it, so I looked forward to getting into it. It took me quite some time to get through and even had to put it down for a time because it made me a little slumpy.SynopsisWhen he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover—then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.It was the plot of the story that drew me to this book in the first place. I really did not know what to expect from it. I thought maybe it was going to be all about forbidden love, but it seemed to be more than that. Once I started reading the book it flowed pretty well, but I just felt like it got real slow about midway through the book. I felt like there was enough to it, for me to finish it, but decided to put it down for awhile. I also found that the writing was somewhat choppy, it skipped a lot detail and left me at a part where I did not understand how I got there. Those details all came after the fact, and the story picked up again once I understood what was going on. I think this story would benefit with a bit more backstory allowing us a better glimpse of the story and our characters.I liked the characters but I did not feel like I 
really
 knew them. I wanted to know more about them and their lives before and after their relationship. There were some details about that, but not really enough to be able to really relate to them. I feel like readers really missed out on Hanna's life in this story. There would certainly be a lot more that the author could tell us about her, so we could understand more about who she was and what she believed.As far as recommending this book, I could recommend it to those who like to read post war Germany, but it is not just about that, it is pretty vague on that subject until more towards the end, it is more about love and understanding of people and their situations. I do think it is worth the read if you are patient, there is a message to be told with this."

Roman nam iz perspektive sada već odraslog čovjeka donosi priču o njegovoj mladosti i kratkoj vezi sa 20ak godina starijom ženom. Ta veza je trajala svega nekoliko mjeseci, u periodu kada je on još bio petnaestogodišnjak, a obilježila je njegov život. Nakon mnogo godina sudbina ga ponovno spaja sa njom i dovodi u iskušenje.Roman je kratak i čitajući ga imamo dojam kao da ustvari čitamo ispovijest jednog čovjeka, njegove osjećaje i dileme. U prvom dijelu pratimo Michaelovu i Haninu vezu, a u drugom i trećem njihov ponovni susret nakon mnogo godina. Hana je u ovom romanu sporedni lik, za razliku od ekranizacije, u kojoj je njena uloga mnogo kompleksnija i bolja (Kate Winslet je za ulogu Hane dobila nagradu Oskar za najbolju glumicu). Jedina zamjerka kada je u pitanju sam roman je činjenica je samom čitanju nije posvećeno toliko pažnje kao što je u ekanizaciji. Ukoliko planirate čitati roman ili gledati ekranizaciju onda vas savjetujem da nipošto ne čitate kratki sadržaj ili tuđe recenzije - dovoljno je da znate da se tu radi o kratkoj vezi dvoje ljude, a koja je obilježila njihove živote. Ono što donosi drugi i treći dio romana, a u vezi je s Haninom sudbinom, prilično je šokantno i veoma zanimljivo :) "

5194,114455191,really liked it,This was an extremely powerful story of a man's love for a troubled older woman. It raises many points of blame as it interweaves this story with that of Nazi Germany. How guilty is guilty and how forced are we as members of a community to adapt to their rules and regulations? We must go unquestionably forward into situations that sometimes we do not have any power over. This was Hanna's story.
5194,2363407072,it was amazing,"This book looks a simple story, is it though? It’s honest, very much. It’s romantic but different from lots of romance story out there and tragic. I couldn’t stop it and I couldn’t stop myself crying most of the book.I’m still hunted by question Hanna asked the judge in court “What would you have done?”. There are many answers to that question and at the same time thinking about Hanna and her personality it’s understandable why she didn’t know and even doesn’t know either at the time of trial.This book is much more than the war and society; more than two people just being entangled in a romantic (not really) relationship.I’m happy I read it."

5194,567659890,really liked it," “There's no need to talk about it, because the truth of what one says lies in what one does.”Another excellent book from Oprah's Book Club!What stands out the most about this book is the beautifully poetic, somewhat haunting, clearly passionately felt writing style. The writer uses short chapters and the tone never alters, following the reader through the pages, heavy on reminiscing about the past, memories, and sometimes veering off into an almost dreamy viewpoint as the scenes take place. A writing style such as this serves such a tragic sort of story perfectly.‘The Reader’ begins immediately on the cliff of falling into the relationship that is the main purpose of the book. At first glance it would seem like it would only be a minor fling, a sexual awakening for the fifteen year old protagonist. This is further hinted out by the moodiness and secrecy from the woman he falls in love with – but surprisingly his love lives on long after the relationship dies, injecting a strange, demented sort of romanticism to the novel. Even at the end, when the last pages were closed by a teary, final scene, the relationship will always be clearly important for the protagonist. It helped develop his life when he was on the brink of becoming a man, shadowing all future relationships and ambitions. Even if it is over, the foundation is cemented. This isn’t a simple romantic wonder, though, as the layers show how wrong it all is, was, and can’t have any choice but to be. The trial was one of the best parts of the novel, revealing a secret I had already guessed on while dishing out atrocities I shuddered to learn. What made this book even more different was the connection after the trial. It shows that, despite his learning of these secrets – whether they are awful or not – that the magic conjured when they met still continued working within his psyche.Of course a book called ‘The Reader’ would have something to do with books. On the surface the book takes a love of reading and makes it grand, but later shows the point isn't some hypothetical, magical enjoyment of books, but is instead showing how easier it is to get buried by ignorance. Enjoyment of books gets tossed out the windows as irrelevant in light of consequences, to in the end come forth as an enjoyable delight all over again.There was this unusual view the protagonist felt about certain sorts of novels, which I don’t necessarily agree with. Some of the experimental literature has made the most shocking, but positive, impact on a generation.“To me it was obvious that experimental literature was experimenting with the reader, and Hanna didn’t need that and neither did I.”Overall ‘The Reader’ shows how powerful a story can be, how it can touch the heart no matter how cold or dead the heart may seem to others, how it can revitalize, loan life in the absence of it. There was a strange love, an almost uncomfortable and somewhat lunatic connection, that illustrates how powerful human connection can become and how it can overshadow development. Even with strong emotions, even if the relationship was not pure nor good, we read and feel as the protagonist keeps casting quick glances in the past while he forges his steps into the future."
5194,220677483,it was amazing,"I first watched the movie version of Bernard Schicks 'The Reader'. The novel, as with most literary versions of film adaptations, adds a bigger depth to an otherwise good adaptation (the medium of film can never be truly faithful I believe in adapting literary work into a visual portrayal). There are many themes in the book; there is firstly a personal objective viewpoint - that being romance and love - the book, or at least part one, could be seen predominantly just as a love story; also, the book is dealing with both a collective national guilt, the guilt being that of a generations involvement with Nazism and the Holocaust. This could be seen then from a objective viewpoint, the wider picture of what the book is trying to tell tied up with the books narrator and his early relationship with an older Woman whom was once a concentration camp guard. So, we have what is essentially both a love story and also a book that attempts to come to terms with a national consciousness based on guilt - and finding scapegoats to blame for what is essentially (possibly) almost a generational fault. However, not only does the book examine these issues, but I thought that there was quite a neat subtext to the novel; the subtext being illiteracy. Hanna, the Woman whom is the narrators first love and whom later becomes tried for letting a massacre during the war, is illiterate - she cannot read nor write - and this very fact quite possibly explains why she ended up, not only in damaging her trial because she fears being found out at being illiterate more than going to jail, but also the very fact of why she joined the SS in the first place. If we are familiar with the film or novel, we initially assume that the book’s title alluded to the narrator as being 'The Reader'. Hanna liked being read to because she was illiterate and Michael (the narrator) is a student. Maybe it is Hanna whom is 'The Reader'? Can illiteracy explain however Hannas role in the massacre, or in any way alleviate her guilt in this (as well as the fact she became a guard as she feared being discovered she was illiterate)?For a novel that is written in short, sharp chapters, with a fluid, emotional prose and comes in at just 200 pages long, it contains many themes as I mentioned. The novel made me cry at the end, more I think than the film did. It is that upsetting. Holocaust literature with a difference."
5194,63181052,liked it,"""We kept up our ritual of reading aloud, showering together, making love, and then lying together. I read her War and Peace with all of Tolstoy's disquisitions on history, great men, Russia, love and marriage; it must have lasted forty or fifty hours. Again, Hanna became absorbed in the unfolding of the book. But it was different this time; she withheld her own opinions; she didn't make Natasha, Andrei, and Pierre part of her world, as she had Luise and Emilia, but entered their world the way one sets out on a long and dazzling journey, or enters a castle which one is allowed to visit, even stay in until one feels at home, but without ever really shedding one's inhibitions. All the things I had read to her before were already familiar to me. War and Peace was new for me, too. We took the long journey together.""It's slightly unfair of me to place this book on my ""the movie is better shelf"", because, to be honest, both versions are amazing. And since the book is so short, the movie is able to do the story justice very well. But I prefer the movie, for the sole reason that Kate Winslet absolutely nailed the character of Hanna. Everything about her performance is absolutely perfect and completely in tune with what Schlink wrote - something I wasn't able to fully appreciate until I read the book. "

Se me hace dificil contar con palabras exactas sobre El lector. De Michael y Hanna. Y de ese final. El libro me engancho de principio a fin. De eso estoy segura. Muchas veces (o podría decir casi todo el libro) algunas cosas que pensaba Michael estaba en completo acuerdo. Otras veces me desconcertaba el caracter de Hanna y su manera de ocultar su secreto con tal de evitar la humillación y la verguenza; y hasta me atrevería a decir que ella es la personificación perfecta de las palabras ""orgullosa"", ""complicada"" y ""reservada"". La manera en que Schlink ha mostrado el tema del Holocausto desde el punto de los juicios. Y ese final que me ha dejado en shock y no logré reponerme hasta llegar a la última página del libro. No niego que la culpabilidad, el desgarro, la tristeza, el amor (que se evoca más en la Primera Parte que en las otras) y la esperanza estan salpicados dentro de todo el libro al igual que me haya recordado en cierta forma el libro de Nabokov (salvo que este último es un caso distinto comparado con el de Schlink). Y no tengo duda de que Schlink ha logrado desconcertarme y dejarme sin palabras con esa fluidez y esas metaforas que desprenden dentro de su narración, en la voz de Michael. Y de que haya retratado a una persona tan complicada y orgullosa y terca como Hanna. Y de dar un final agridulce pero esperanzador al mismo tiempo.El lector es uno de esos libros que volvería a leer dentro de un tiempo y que, sin duda, se ha convertido en una de mis lecturas favoritas de lo que va en el año y en el tiempo que llevo leyendo.


¿Por qué me pongo tan triste cuando pienso en aquellos días? ¿Será que añoro la felicidad pasada? Lo cierto es que en las siguientes semanas fui feliz. Me las pasé estudiando como un imbécil, hasta sacar el curso, mientras nos amábamos como si nada más importara en el mundo. ¿O será por lo que descubrí más tarde, por la sombra que ese descubrimiento tardío arroja sobre aquellos días del pasado?

5194,125087571,really liked it,"This is a reminiscence of a young man's love affair with a former Nazi prison camp guard. It is a taut and well-told story. Our narrator maintains a relationship with his former lover while she serves an 18 year jail term for her crimes by reading to her. He records himself reading books and sends the tapes to her in prison. Initially, the tension in the story is sexual, as the narrator describes his encounters with the former guard. She is in her mid-30s and he is still in high school. Later, her trial is described and we read that she is blamed for master-minding the horrific deaths of several prisoners. Her culpability for the incident is exaggerated in the trial, but she fails to defend herself out of shame for her illiteracy."

Ésta es una historia de amor, de pérdida, de culpa, de erotismo, de aprendizaje, de horror. Me ha parecido extraordinaria la manera en que Schlink logra construir una historia, si no de amor, sí sobre la relación entre dos seres humanos cuyos caminos se intersectan en un punto y cambian para siempre, al tiempo que reflexiona sobre el impacto que un terrible hecho histórico tiene sobre un país, su gente y su futuro. Michael Berg conoce a Hanna Schmitz una tarde en la que él, en una crisis de hepatitis, vomita y está a punto de desmayarse fuera de su edificio. Ella, una mujer de 36 años, ayuda al joven de apenas 15 a limpiarse y recuperarse y lo lleva a casa. Michael regresa para agradecerle y de esa forma, se asoma por primera vez a los secretos de la atracción hacia una mujer: el descubrimiento de otro cuerpo, lo sensual de un gesto, lo erótico de una mirada. Sin ningún tapujo, se vuelven amantes y al poco tiempo, desarrollan una extraña costumbre: ella le pide que le lea libros antes de tener relaciones, el preámbulo amoroso. Así suceden varios meses, en los que Michael vive sólo para los momentos en que se encuentra con Hanna y que evoluciona a una especie de relación –viajan juntos, ríen, pelean. Y aunque desde el principio se sabe sin esperanza, el día que Hanna se marcha sin despedirse, la vida del adolescente cambia de manera irremediable. Como él mismo describe, adoptó una actitud de fanfarronería y superioridad, esforzándose por mostrarse como alguien que no se dejaba afectar ni conmover por nada ni nadie. Siete años después, siendo estudiante de derecho, Michael vuelve a ver a Hanna durante su juicio como criminal de guerra –Hanna había pertenecido a las fuerzas de la SS y sido guardia en dos campos de concentración. Ella, ésa mujer que Michael había percibido como dura, fría, distante a pesar del amor, había sido parte, o había sido, el horror. Y es aquí en donde la novela da un vuelco, pasando de una historia de amor a una reflexión sobre las acciones de personas, hombres y mujeres que parecían tan comunes y corrientes y que, sin embargo, fueron parte de uno de los momentos más crueles y oscuros de la historia de la humanidad –el Holocausto. Si bien el libro no entra en detalle sobre los crímenes de Hanna, entendemos que fueron terribles; que hubo testigos, sobrevivientes que la señalan e incluso, otras de las mujeres juzgadas, la acusan de ser quien les ordenaba actuar de tal o cual manera. Sin embargo, se sabe también que Hanna escogía, en el campo de concentración, a mujeres a quienes llevaba a su habitación y les pedía que le leyeran en voz alta.Michael pronto se da cuenta que la gran culpa, el peor crimen para la propia Hanna no había sido su actuar en los campos de concentración –de hecho, quedé con la impresión que el personaje no siente algún tipo de remordimiento– sino el ser analfabeta. En su afán por esconder esta verdad, Hanna tomó decisiones que la llevar a unirse a la SS y ahí, a cambiar su destino. Michael entonces se debate entre juzgar a esa mujer, o comprenderla y perdonarla por sus crímenes. ¿Tuvo ella la culpa? ¿Sus circunstancias la llevaron a tomar una decisión equivocada? Pero, ¿podría ella no saber que actuaba mal cuando evidentemente eran acciones atroces, que terminaron con vidas humanas? En este punto Schlink explora el peso de la memoria histórica del nazismo en las siguientes generaciones de alemanes, planteando la gran carga moral y social que implicó. Un pasaje que me impactó es cuando Michael platica con un hombre quién lo está llevando a un campo de concentración y al saber por qué quiere visitarlo, el hombre le dice: 
“El verdugo no obedece órdenes. Simplemente hace su trabajo; no odia a las personas a las que ejecuta, no lo hace por venganza, no las mata porque se interpongan en su camino o lo amenacen o lo ataquen. Le son completamente indiferentes. Tan indiferentes, que le da lo mismo matarlas o no matarlas.”
 (p. 143).Si no todos los que fueron parte de la maquinaria nazi odiaban a los judíos, ¿entonces cómo pudieron asesinarlos? ¿Qué es más monstruoso entonces, el odio hacia un pueblo o la indiferencia que convierte al ser humano en máquinas, incapaz de discernir entre el bien y el mal? La respuesta no es fácil y quizá hoy en día Alemania, y el resto del mundo, continúa intentando descifrarla –y la historia reciente nos ha mostrado otras cosas en los que la indiferencia ha sido la peor cómplice. Creo que Hanna es un analogía de la guerra –así como ésta destruyó y marcó a una generación, así esta mujer marcó a Michael por siempre. Aunque pasaron los años, él jamás aprendió a ser feliz tras perderla –obsesión, amor, no resulta claro– pero lo que fuera, la esencia de Hanna siempre lo persiguió y no le permitió amar verdaderamente a otra mujer. Cuando la reencontró, no sólo recordó la relación amorosa sino que Hanna le hizo enfrentar la historia de su país, de culpas, de crímenes innombrables con el resultado determinante de que Michael nunca pudo ser genuinamente libre."
5194,577342270,really liked it,"The Reader tells the story of the teenage years of Michael Berg while recovering from hepatitis and his passionate affair with a mysterious woman twice his age. Later going on to study law and discovering that this woman was involved in the death march from Auschwitz. The book continues on through the war crimes trial and the relationship between the two after her imprisonment.Bernhard Schlink was born in 1944 (one year before the war ending), studied law then became a professor of public law and the philosophy of law. His passion for reading comes from a teacher in his high school who encouraged his reading and discovery of literature. Later he discovers that this teacher was a member of the Gestapo and involved in some questionable practices. His first series of books featuring a sixty year old private investigator Gerhard Selb (Selb translates to Self) also had a questionable past during the war and his coming to terms with this. This is interesting since the books in the series are called; Self’s Punishment, Self’s Deception and Self’s Murder. Also he has a collection of essays called Vergangenheitsschuld which translates to Guilt about the Past, which leads you to believe that Bernhard Schlink has a fascination about the effect of World War II has on the next generation of Germans.This is not a book about the Holocaust novel; while this historical event plays a role, this is rather a novel that gives you a lot of questions and problems to think through. Divided into three parts; the summer of love, the trial and imprisonment; The Reader explores three different scenarios as well as the notion of keeping secrets. At the start of the book Hannah comes across as Good Samaritan trying to help Michael who was throwing up in the street. Later he pursues her and she gets an impression that he is old enough to be out of school; he doesn’t correct her, thinking the papers he leaves behind was enough for her to know his true age but we later finds out she would never have looked at them. When she finds out, they are in bed together and he tells her that he is skipping classes to be with her. She throws him out and it’s not until very later in the book we discover just how important education is to her. Hannah is his first love, he is too young to fully understand the kind of relationship they are having, while Hannah remains guarded and tries to protect both her public and private shames.While most people focus mostly on the relationship between the two, but there is so much more to look at in the novel. Years later Michael finds Hannah again in a trial and the reader is asked to consider two things; the nature of her guilt and the significance of her other secret (the one she is more ashamed of it). While she was never the ringleader of her charges and she was following orders, when it came to the damning report, she let the court believe she wrote it to continue to hide her illiteracy. This brings to the overall concept to the book; ignorance is not necessarily innocence. The pride to protect herself from people discovering of her illiteracy works against her though out the entire book. She gives up promotions and lands herself in prison all to protect this secret.This leads into the third part; years later we find that Michael starts reading to Hannah once again. Sending cassettes both the reader and Hannah mistakenly get the impression that this is an act of affection and when Hannah eventually finds out, we also find out just how cold he has been acting. I’m not sure if he was trying to gain back the power in their relationship or just the bitterness of his life doing it but we are led to believe he still cares about Hannah when all he really cares about is that summer fling when he was still a teenager.The book wants you to recognise that you are the reader, and Hannah, in particular, wants you to realise just how blessed you are to be able to read this book. I remember there was a great movie adaptation of this book a while ago; while very meta to have a movie about reading, I’m surprised how well it came together. I didn’t remember much about this movie while I read this but it all come back to me as I discovered it in the book. It was a great feeling to remember as I read and not know what would happen next.I really loved this book; there is that element of uncomfortableness with the relationship at the start, which really is something people can be afraid to talk about but with a book like this it can be scandalous. There are also so many other interesting elements that I think are equally valuable; especially with the whole German shame towards what they did in World War II and the next generation having to deal with it. While the movie closely follows the book, it is still worth reading; I highly recommend it.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://literary-exploration.com/2013/..."
5194,1572610146,really liked it,"Excellent book. This is the story of a man who is remembering back to when he was 15 years old - he was a teenager in Germany and he had an affair with an older woman. He remembers many years later when she was put on trial for murder and he realized she was hiding a secret that she thought was shameful. The story is very introspective and mainly seems to be in his head - everything he thinks and feels and doesn't feel. Perhaps the phrase ""doesn't feel"" applies to much of this as he explains his numbness to it all. The author is German and he talks about the generation in Germany following World War II and what they have had to go through and how they have tried to cope with the legacy the previous generation left them. I was interested in this viewpoint - it isn't one which I have read much of, mostly just reading World War II books written by Americans.And the ending - maybe I expected it, I'm not sure. I'm very glad I read this book.As an aside, I first noticed this book for sale at the library so I decided to order it from the catalog. I went to the catalog, found the book, then clicked to put it on hold. It did but the computer never asked for my name and card number. I realized then that the previous man did not actually sign out of his account so now it was in his holds list. So, I signed him out and ordered it for my card but was unable to cancel his hold.

5194,2280264609,liked it,"It's rather sad how one person can have such a strong influence on someone else's life, particularly at a young age, and affect them for the rest of their living days. This is what struck me near the end of The Reader.Although I wasn't blown away by this book, it really did have me thinking a lot. It begins as a love story between a 15-year-old boy, Michael, and an older woman in her thirties at the time, Hanna. This was my least favourite part of the book and I found myself getting more interested in the book was it was over. Nevertheless, it still had me questioning matters, such as, what if the roles were reversed and Michael was a 15-year-old girl and Hanna was an older man? Later on in the book, I looked back on this relationship as well and how it had such a deep impact on Michael's formation as a person. It breaks him in a way as he seems to become incapable of loving anyone again in the same way, which is horribly sad. It results (view spoiler)[in an unsatisfying marriage and consequentially, a divorce. (hide spoiler)]Michael is never able to shake Hanna from his mind. Perhaps he might have been able to loosen her hold on him more had he never encountered her again, but of course, (view spoiler)[he does through the trial. (hide spoiler)] Arguably, this has an effect on his working life as well as his romantic life. It also seems to affect his social life. In the end, Michael never seems happy or satisfied with anything. It's shown in the clinical writing style and constant philosophizing about guilt and betrayal and who is really at fault.One of the saddest facts of this book is that it is apparently semi-autobiographical. So Michael and Hanna's lives are actually based off of a reality. Once I realized it was semi-autobiographical, I began reading it more from the actual author's perspective and not just Michael's perspective as a fictional character, which felt quite surreal.There were aspects I liked and disliked about this book. It was a simple read, however, thought-provoking. It's an odd feeling once you finish The Reader. Well, at least it is for me. I can't really describe it."
5194,687647108,really liked it,"Every book is different in its own way. Sometimes it depends on who is reading it, and to what extend they can identify with it. This is one of those books that spoke to me. It has a strange way of making me see a bit of myself, a past unspoken (and not really to be spoken of) experience. A cheeky boy will read this for its eroticism, especially in the first third of the book. But it goes way beyond that to ask some fundamental moral questions.The Reader is set in Post War German. A place and time rich with Holocaust Lit. I like to read a lot about the WWII. Sophie's choice, (briefly mentioned in this work) is one of my favorite books. The book tells the story of Michael Berg. As a grown man he recalls his experiences growing up. But all these experiences have been defined, shaped, and reconstructed by his meeting Hanna at 15. She found him on the road home from school one day, sick with hepatitis. Everything he becomes, and how he relates to his future girlfriends, and wife, is founded on the affair he had with Hanna. Whether to both or to each individually, this affair ruined and informed the rest of their lives significantly. One would even say, disastrously. Berg, as he is studying law, sees Hanna again during a court trial. And she seems desperate to hide something. He discovers that she is illiterate and this the reason she insisted he reads to her aloud. Just she had made her prisoners do when she worked for the SS. And Hanna would rather admit guilt than be exposed to the shame of her condition. This is a brilliant book, with honest, straightforward prose. It makes the truths hit straight home. "
5194,60743133,it was ok,"Though The Reader was highly acclaimed it left me rather, I’m reluctant to use the word bored so let’s say instead, unimpressed. Every time I come across the novel everybody seems to love but me I get a bit nervous and unsure. Maybe I missed something, maybe I wasn’t perceptive enough, or sensitive or something. I’m not ashamed of reading and liking even trashy, in someone else's opinion, novels or not liking recognised readings. There is no accounting for tastes or so they say. Anyway, my point is I like to know what I missed so fundamental to not appreciate particular reading more. And I'm all at sea here.Whatever angle I’m trying it’s not enough. Holocaust novel? I’ve read better, more powerful, impressive, disturbing and devastating readings already. Coming-of-age story? Likewise. Romance younger boy with older woman? You know the answer, right? I felt bad for not liking it better for I liked it premise, but I thought Schlink cut corners here. I didn't find writing memorable, though it could be a matter of translation so I'm not going to argue about it, protagonists felt flatly and plot at times ridiculous, and as a whole I found it neither scandalous nor engaging, nor purifying."
5194,39282303,really liked it,"A fast read. Germany post-WWII when they are just coming to terms with their Nazi past, ""the reader"", a teenage boy of 15 is awakened sexually by a woman twice his age with a secret past. Besides sex, a large part of their time together is spent with him reading literature to her. After an intense affair she vanishes, leaving him devastated and emotionally numb as he moves through the next few years. In college, he encounters her again as a law student at her trial for war crimes as a Nazi guard at a concentration camp. ""The reader"" himself, and I as the reader, were faced with conflicting emotions; is she good or bad? Is she victim of circumstances or heartless criminal? It's a very interesting look at the little people who were part of the machine that carried out the Nazi holocaust. The ordinary people who were part of the Nazi regime, the rest of the population who turned a blind eye to it in their midst, and the next generation who had to try to create an identity out of the rubble of their defeat and shame after the war.

5194,1023497665,really liked it,"'The Reader' is such a simple book to read and yet it leaves you reeling with the demand it places on you, the reader. This story of Hanna and Berg is bound to leave an impression. It does not talk about the black and white but deals in the realm of grey all throughout. If you have seen the movie, which has stuck to the script faithfully, this book is still worth reading.The book is set in post war Germany spanning over 30 years from the end of war to the trials and the reforms. I remembered Julian Barnes stating about how in a book authors say ""She did this because.."" while in real life it is ""She did this"" without any explanation. (He goes on to say that is why people prefer books to people, but..) That is so true of this book, where actions of Hanna are inexplicable, illogical and hence much more real. The narrator is puzzled and his interpretation of her actions change as the book progresses. Each part has portions of moral dilemma and philosophies that, once you put yourself in the shoes of the characters, realize are such difficult choices. There is one poignant moment during the trials when Hanna asks the judge ""What would you have done?"" and stuns the courtroom. Hanna's secret that made her endure punishments for crimes she did not commit and the her subsequent transformation are heart wrenching. At the end of the first part, I was left wondering if all the cold eroticsm was necessary and had meaning. I started reading the societal impact of the Nazi regime on the post war Germany in the second part. It gave rise to a generation who were angry at their parents allowing the Nazis to slip into normal life post war. That is when I realized only the intimacy of an youth of this generation with a woman old enough to be his mother can make him explore the complex emotions of guilt and duty without being dismissive. And it all fell into piece. For all the horrors of the post WW-II Germany, this book is more about compassion. And Kate Winslet was Hanna to me (what an actor!) An impact-ful read!"
5194,456519605,liked it,"The book is divided roughly into three sections. The first is the encounter of the main character (Michael Berg) with the seducing woman (Hanna) and the subsequent readings; the second is his witnessing of her trail or what was behind the true nature of the woman who seduced him; and the last - takes place several years after his readings to Hanna when she is close to concluding her term of imprisonment.The first part is the strongest and most interesting as Michael attempts to explore the nature of his relationship to Hanna. I found the second part with its description of Hanna’s performance at the trial to be very distant – almost like he didn’t want to visualize her true nature and what she was capable of doing. Was this a metaphor for how Nazi Germany is viewed by Germans today?There is an initial intoxication with the erotic encounters; but after, the evil is viewed from afar. The trial is like a series of words that one reads through a telescope; as if these events did not happen from the same people and geography.The continued readings to Hanna could be interpreted as an attempt to educate her – to remove her from the Nazi past.I found the movie (of the same title) much more emotional; it added needed feeling to the raw complexity of the story.

5194,1860469747,it was amazing,"A los 15 años Michael conoce a Hanna, una mujer mayor que él, la cual lo cautiva y de la que se enamora, pero Hanna tiene un secreto y no está dispuesta a revelarlo. Es el amor por aquella mujer, el secreto inesperado y los actos que se esconden en ella, lo que marca la vida del narrador. No es una historia de amor como tal, pero si una en la que se ven aflorar diferentes sentimientos como el deseo, la culpa, la vergüenza, la indiferencia, el perdón, el miedo, el odio, entre otros; en los que Michael profundiza para encontrarle sentido a lo que fue en su vida haber amado a Hanna. Ambientado en Alemania, involucra en una parte del relato una perspectiva de lo sucedido en los campos de concentración de Auschwitz y la marcha de la muerte. Escrito con un lenguaje claro y sencillo, pero con personajes complejos.Es una historia llena de nostalgia y melancolía que quizá no pueda gustarle a todo el mundo, ya que parece estar falta de emoción, pero eso no verdad, tiene emoción escondida en cada sentimiento que se refleja, muy lejos de la banalidad. A mí me ha gustado mucho porque no todos los libros me hacen sentir como esté lo hizo. "

Einige Dialoge wurden haargenau wiedergegeben. Allerdings geht der Film manchmal tiefer, vor allem was die Studenten und deren Meinung zu dem Prozess angeht. Andere Punkte aus dem Buch wurden ausgespart. So fehlt auch das Gespräch, dass der Protagonist mit einem vermeintlichen SS Offizier führt, das für mich aber sehr prägend war."

5194,922206429,liked it,"Betraying not to betrayIn Germany, many years after the World War II, those who had been too young to take an active part in the Nazi period were called “the lucky-late born”. But what is it so lucky in suspecting, openly accusing or ashamedly hiding the crimes of your parents, relatives, older friends? How did an entire “late-born” generation deal with this feeling of shame and betrayal intertwined with love? How did they cope?They did not, Bernard Schlink tells us in his novel The Reader, because they could not. Every memory of every gesture and every word of love became eventually tarnished by a past that forever shadowed them, stealing their ingenuity and their joy:Why? Why does what was beautiful suddenly shatter in hindsight because it concealed dark truths? Why does the memory of years of happy marriage turn to gall when our partner is revealed to have had a lover all those years? Because such a situation makes it impossible to be happy? But we were happy! Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily. Moreover, dreadful disclosures tend to superpose happy memories, corrupting them with the suspicion of potential dangers, thus doubting the very essence of love. This was the tragedy of a generation. This is the tragedy of the narrator, Michael Berg when he discovers his former lover Hanna Schmitz, who disappeared without a word many years ago, in a courtroom among other defendants accused of war crimes:Would she have sent me to the gas chamber if she hadn’t been able to leave me, but wanted to get rid of me?It is not accidental that there are many insurmountable gaps between the two lovers: of age (she is thirty-six to his fifteen), of education (he is a student she will be proven illiterate), of mentality, of emotional and physical intensity, gaps that will add to the awful discovery to confuse and hurt the narrator into re-writing his past while becoming resigned that this past will shape his future under the inescapable sign of guilt and betrayal:…if I was not guilty because one cannot be guilty of betraying a criminal, then I was guilty of having loved a criminal.It is the guilt of all German sons, brothers and friends in this guilt of a lover who tries to make sense of a senseless past that robbed him of his life. Michael tries to ease it by a cathartic gesture, that revives an old ritual of their former relationship: he records himself reading and send the tapes in prison to Hanna, either because he guessed she cannot read and as a way of remembering their happy days together. But even this memory is somehow stained by the ambiguous uncovering during the process that she used to choose young, frail girls to read to her for a month or so before sending them to Auschwitz to die. It is his way to compromise with his past, to accept the unacceptable until he finally can resign to go on with his life:In the first years after Hanna’s death, I was tormented by the old question of whether I owed her something, whether I was guilty of having loved her. Sometimes I asked myself if I was responsible for her death. And sometimes I was in a rage at her and at what she had done to me. Until finally the rage faded and the questions ceased to matter. Whatever I had done or not done, whatever she had done or not to me – it was the path my life had taken.The final question Schlink’s novel seems to ask concerns the extent of the bystander’s guilt. Could Michael have redeemed Hanna and thus free himself? Did he betray himself by betraying her? Is there a way for this crippled generation to forget the horrors of the beloved past without denying them? Is there a path towards forgiveness? And it comes into my mind a discussion on the same subject in John Fowles’ The Magus, which could also explain why the obvious answer to this question is negative:""I suppose one could say that Hitler didn't betray his self."" (…)""You are right. He did not. But millions of Germans did betray their selves. That was the tragedy. Not that one man had the courage to be evil. But that millions had not the courage to be good."" "
5194,2252193293,it was amazing,"I really never intended to read this book. All I really knew about it was that the subject matter was a bit...uncomfortable. The story is told by a grown man named Michael who grew up in post-war Germany and had an ongoing affair with a 35 year old woman when he was only 15. However, it's more than a story of sex. This is a story about love, betrayal, and coming to terms with the past. With only 215 pages, this book packs a LOT of content in very few words. I was surprised how strongly I was affected by it. I've read a lot of fiction set during World War II, but this was unlike any of them. It actually starts in the late 1950s and spans both of their lifetimes. Most of the book is spent in adult Michael's head as he deals with the shocking discovery that his former lover was a Auschwitz guard. I would love to say I hated the female character (Hanna) but I actually felt for her. I doubt she intended to work in a concentration camp, and she definitely didn't choose the life she had. She was just trying to survive in a world where every option was bad. I actually felt more disappointment in Michael that he continuously betrayed her. Hearing his constant defensive narrative was annoying, like he was wanting us, the readers, to take his side.I chose this as a book club selection for that reason. There was so much to talk about! I think these are the best kind of book for discussions. It's interesting to see how different we all handle moral dilemmas. I think, for this book anyway, you really have to take into account the time period and the difficulty this generation had dealing with the war. The effects were still very fresh and most of them had family who were involved in the good parts and the bad. They didn't know if they should be thankful they weren't born a little bit earlier, or ashamed that they weren't there.From the very beginning, I could see that Michael was a weak person. He was ashamed of the class difference between he and Hanna and kept her a secret from friends. He doesn't speak up when he knows Hanna couldn't have committed the crimes for which she was on trial. When he learned that Hanna would be imprisoned for life, he never went to visit or wrote one letter. Talk about a punch to the gut.I do feel this is an important book. I don't know any other books that captures the struggles this generation must have had. Some say this may be based on the author's true life story, but he denies it. Even if it's a work of fiction, I am humbled by his ability to write such a simple, meaningful story in such a way that no one can believe it isn't true!If you're more of a movie person, this book was adapted for the screen in 2008, and was nominated for 5 Academy Awards. I personally haven't watched it but I'm sure I will. I always enjoy critiquing movies that were books first, if only to point out all the ways the book was better."

5194,946394103,liked it,"I read this book long, long ago and then it was chosen for my Movie/Book club at the local library. I had not seen the movie because I wasn't thrilled with the book. I realize this is a book review, but I feel it only fair to mention, and compare, the movie as well now that I have seen it. This is one of those rare instances that the movie was better.The book is written in a very very linear way. For this particular subject, I feel the movie handled scenes better. By the end of the book we know Michael has been emotionally crippled by what takes place between he and Hanna. The movie lets us know that right up front. If it weren't bad enough that an older woman would seduce a 15 year old boy, the opening scene of the movie alerts us to the fact that there is more what the fuckery to come. The novel touches on parts of our past we want to forget. Parts we think have no excuse and can never, ever be forgiven. Showing us Hanna's ""crimes"" in the framework of her seduction of a young boy makes them less forgivable to some and more palatable to others. She is a real person. With feelings, wants, hopes and crushed dreams. She is not some faceless name.Schlink, like so many others who have written about the Holocaust and its aftermath, shows us that the Nazis were a humongous machine with so, so many cogs and screws that were only working with the whole. They were not making decisions or policy, they were ""going along"". It's wrong, but when Hanna asks ""What should I have done? Should I not have signed up for the SS at Siemens?"", we see that it's one step after another, many, many steps that lead to atrocity. Which was the first step? In hindsight we may be able to pinpoint that, but as those steps are taken, it's just one more in a long line of steps.Schlink could have done a better job at pinpointing those steps. In real life we have only hindsight to go by. A novelist has the ability to use time as he will, bend it if need be, to show us what will eventually be most important. I feel he lost that opportunity. Books are not real life and the ability to show us life ""better"" should be taken advantage of. Schlink did not do that.I would give the story here five stars, but since I feel we are rating the book and not just the idea behind the book, I can only give the way that story was told three stars."
5194,131280748,liked it,"A story of forbidden love, of law, ignorance and there are Scandalous elements, as well. The whole story in general isn't that bad although Schlink writing is thin and his idea of depth is to fill few pages with general questions which is, sorry, but cheap. However, when he writes about feelings, he can be nice:“I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love.” It's a good\light book.P.S: The movie version is way too better than the movie. I mean Kate Winslet. Kate Freaking Winslet! "

Deshalb soll nur eins gesagt sein, die Worte die Schlink wählt, um seine Umwelt und alltägliche Beobachtungen en détail zu beschreiben, sind besonders. Sie sind so wohltuend, wie warme Milch mit Honig. Dieser einzigartige Schreibstil und die Gabe dem Leser zu ermöglichen, so tief und gleichzeitig aus einer Distanz Charaktere kennen zulernen, sind Gründe, weshalb er für mich definitiv ein favourite author ist."

Wunderbar ist aber die Sicht der Nazis aus der 2. Generation und die Beschreibung der Lähmung und Gleichgültigkeit sowohl bei Tätern als auch bei den Opfern. Auf jeden Fall neuartige und interessante Sichtweisen zu dem Thema. Wenn das Buch noch in den 70er Jahren geschrieben worden wäre, wär die Aufarbeitung genial gewesen."

5194,1340026985,it was amazing,"È veramente curioso come gli argomenti dei libri si rincorrano e ci si trovi a leggere spesso un libro che riprende temi appena visti. Qualche tempo fa ho letto e commentato il libro ""Con gli occhi del nemico"" di David Grossman. Dicevo in quel commento che per Grossman ""narrare significa avere la possibilità di avvicinarsi all’altro, assumendone il punto di vista, comprendendone le ragioni. Significa creare storie e personaggi in grado di far pensare i lettori con la testa di qualcun altro, far guardare la realtà cambiando il punto di vista. Anche se 'l'altro' è un nemico."" Nel libro ""A voce alta"" l'altro non è il nemico, ma è il ""cattivo"", il ""crudele"". Abbiamo letto centinaia di libri sui campi di concentramento, sull'Olocausto, sulle stragi della seconda guerra mondiale visti con gli occhi dei prigionieri, degli ebrei dei deboli. Ecco, questo libro tenta di vedere le cose dal punto di vista dei carcerieri. E l'effetto è mirabile.Ci sono tre temi diversi in questo libro meraviglioso che parla principalmente di Michael e Hanna, che al momento in cui si conoscono hanno rispettivamente 15 e 36 anni.Un primo tema, direi il più importante, è quello delle ragioni che portano gli esseri umani a compiere cose terribili.Hanna, è accusata di essersi arruolata nelle SS come sorvegliante nei campi di reclusione e di avere fatto un'azione terribile. Perché? Perché vivevano in uno stato di continua incoscienza, come anestetizzate, senza i naturali impulsi di compassione e umanità, dopo mesi e anni di violenze, di ingiustizie e di crimini gratuiti.“Lei non sapeva che spediva le prigioniere a morire? Sì, ma le nuove stavano arrivando e le vecchie dovevano far posto alle nuove. Lei dunque diceva, siccome voleva far posto: tu, tu e tu devi essere rispedita e ammazzata? Hanna non capì che cosa il presidente intendesse chiedere con questo.Era il nostro compito. Che cosa avrebbe fatto lei?""""Che cosa avrebbe fatto lei"". Questa frase buttata in faccia al giudice è terribile. Cosa avrebbe fatto la maggioranza delle persone nelle medesime condizioni, di fronte alle due alternative: asservimento del proprio ""dovere"" oppure morte? Non c'è giustificazione per chi ha fatto quello che ha fatto. Non c'è perdono. Ma la sensazione di disagio, pensando a quella situazione, si insinua.È possibile fare ammenda di quelle atrocità? Schlink si domanda se la presa di distanza tra coloro che hanno compiuto questi crimini e le generazioni successive non sia una questione di sopravvivenza, ossia un espediente per dimenticare, per mettere un confine con un passato impossibile da giustificare.Il secondo tema del libro è quello dell'ignoranza e dell'analfabetismo, visto come handicap, come forma di minorità.Hanna nasconde un segreto, una debolezza che non è disposta a confessare a nessun costo, nemmeno nel corso della sua ostinata difesa, nemmeno a sua parziale discolpa. Una vergogna apparentemente innocente per la quale accetta di diventare una criminale e assistere allo strazio di vittime innocenti. Hanna viene condannata all’ergastolo, per questo segreto.Passerà tutta la sua vita a studiare, a conoscere, perché si rende conto che solo in questo modo può migliorare, può ridurre il divario con i suoi simili, cui si sente in qualche modo inferiore.Il terzo e ultimo tema è quello dell'amore.Michael e Hanna, lui ragazzino lei donna già fatta, finiscono uno tra le braccia dell'altra prima ancora di conoscere i rispettivi nomi. Per il ragazzo è una travolgente iniziazione all’amore, per lei un modo per dimenticare il suo passato. Tra loro nasce una storia intensa, profonda, devastante quanto impossibile.Col “ragazzino”, come lo chiama fino all’ultima pagina della storia, Hanna passa delle giornate bellissime. Gli chiede di leggerle a voce alta i romanzi e i poeti che studia e lei segue sempre rapita, attenta, divertita. Ogni giorno leggono, fanno la doccia insieme e fanno l’amore.Il libro per me è scritto in modo perfetto. Il tono distaccato dell'autore fa da sfondo ed esalta la forza e la brutalità delle azioni commesse da Hanna. I continui flash-back , i colpi di scena, le riflessioni importanti, le atrocità e la codardia creano un racconto incalzante da cui non ci si riesce a staccare. Il presente e il passato continuamente si incrociano con le vite dei protagonisti, che hanno in comune la condivisione di una esperienza importante, oppressa da ricordi ingombranti.Il messaggio del romanzo è che non sempre un'azione, per quanto causi dolore, sia da considerarsi malvagia in assoluto e che una scelta debba essere giudicata in base alle ragioni che hanno portato a compierla. Inoltre è forte e ben sottolineato il contrasto tra legge e moralità.Visto che guardo pochissimo la televisione e che di regola evito i film al cinema che dicono ""tratto dal libro...."" ho avuto la fortuna di non sapere nulla della storia prima della lettura. Ed il risultato è stato meraviglioso; uno dei più bei libri letti, in assoluto."

5194,71894360,liked it,"Earlier this year, I read The Children's Bookby A. S. Byatt, and the book stuck with me. The Reader is something like that, though it sticks with me in a different way. Both books make you think, but The Reader makes you think in a way that causes you to doubt yourself. I'm not sure if I really got this book, and I'm not sure if any reader is suppose to get this book.It's one of those books.The main issue is the character of Hanna. Is she a pedophile? I'm not sure. Schlink does seem to try to excuse her. After she takes Michael to bed, she implies that she believed he was a college student. Then she thinks he is seventeen, not the fifteen he really is. Does her belief that Michael is 17 make her less of a sexual predator. I know that if she were a 36 year old male, we wouldn't see it that way. It seems that Schlink is trying to give her a weak out, a very, very weak out. I don't like that type of manipulation.It is very clear that the relationship is unhealthy. It is abusive, Hanna is manipulative. Additionally, in some ways, the relationship feels like a male wish fulfillment. See, I'm so macho that older women dig me, type of a feel. That could be the result of the abuse. The relationship does change Michael, for the worst. It saps his emotion.Yet, the first section is told like a love story, an sexual awakening story. An older woman introduces an younger man into the realm of sex story. (And why are those stories so different in tone from the older man introduces younger woman to sex stories?). It is a weird juxtaposition.Then comes the trial of Hanna, and in many ways this is the best part of the book. The idea of guilt and coming to terms with it, the question of when the call for justice must end, or even if it must, the question of when enough self flagellation and apology is enough. All these are raised over the last two thirds of the book.It is here that Hanna comes across as more sympathetic. It is no surprise to the astute and careful reader that Hanna herself cannot read. What is important is that of all the defendants Hanna is the only one who takes responsibility for her actions. She refuses to lie, at least in the most basic sense; out of all the women she comes across as the best because she acknowledges the fault. The others do not. This is where the reader is made to feel a degree of sympathy for her. It is where Michael comes across as victim and unfeeling executioner. We want him to do more than he does, and yet, we understand why he does not. He parallels Hanna here, to a far lesser degree, but it is there.It is the trial too that seems off. It comes across as muted, so much so that I can understand Daniel Mendelsohn's reaction to the movie version (which I have not seen). It does seem to be unjust. And yet. And yet, perhaps that is what Schlink is trying to show, how repetitive horror numbs people. Is this a good thing, a bad thing, or simply a survival mechanism? There is such a sense of numbness in this novel. I have never read anything where the characters feel this numb. This numbness seems to be a theme of the novel. The coldness that life and it's loves, aches, horrors can do to us. There are different levels in the book. Hanna, Michael, judges, jury, the mother and daughter. All are numb. The reader to is numb by the end of the book. Except, by the end of the book Michael is no longer numb. It seems the reader changes places with him. Perhaps Schlink is preaching against allowing numbness to take over. Michael’s life would’ve been better if he hadn’t been numb; Hanna would have been better if she hadn’t been numb; and so on.Maybe that’s the point."
5194,2025300063,it was amazing,"I loved this book. Kept me awake at night , made me cry. Loved the character of Hanna , such a complex one but I guess was the realest and everyone would have sympathy for her. Loved and hated at the same time Michael, such a coward but a loving one. Loved how the human nature and its complexity is perceived through the story. A book to remember.P.S. Haven't seen the movie. :p"
5194,819920061,liked it,"This book has been translated into English, as The Reader.If you're waiting for a sign to read this book, THIS IS IT! It's short, tackles two serious topics and it can end up being sort of interesting too.The main reason for adding  The Reader to my list was its length. I knew it had been made into a film, a serious-business type of film, not a run-of-the- mill-young-adult variety. So naturally I was expecting this to have been a classic, from the time of The Great Gatsby. I was even somewhat disappointed to find out that it was first published in the mid 90s. 15-year-old Michael gets really sick on the way home, luckily a kind stranger notices his plight and helps him home. After weeks of bed rest, Michael is well enough to go out for short walks and he decides to find his rescuer. Hanna lives in a run-down apartment, has a boring job, treats Michael with a joking superiority and yet our hero can't help but find her fascinating. It doesn't take long for the two to start a brief but torrid love affair. Michael is aware of the impossibility of their relationship, of Hanna's inexplicable mood-swings, but still he convinces himself than things are fine the way they are. Until one day, she just disappears, only to unexpectedly turn up again during the war crime trials as one of the accused.It's a bitter-sweet love story, and a sad remembrance of the horrors of the Holocaust. I'm not sure if I actually cried or not, but I could definitely sympathize with the narrator all the way through. I actually suspected the nature of Hanna's secret far sooner than the author. Then again, I am not a 15-year-old in the throes of first love.There was nothing really wrong with the story. I was actually quite taken with both the first part, where Michael and Hanna's sexual encounters are detailed quite graphically, as well as the second. where Hanna's past is revealed. That said, there was nothing compelling me to gush about the book to everyone. I guess I'd rate it 3.3/5. More than average, but not quite on the same level as other similar books, such as  Exodus or  The Diary of a Young Girl."
5194,1464324388,really liked it,"Mình thấy ""The Reader"" không phải là một bản án, một sự kết tội một chế độ nào đó trong quá khứ, mà chỉ đơn giản là một câu chuyện tình. Có thể còn những tầng chìm trong tác phẩm, nhưng mình thì mình chỉ thấy một câu chuyện tình. Câu chuyện tình kéo dài không lâu giữa một cô gái ngoài ba mươi với một cậu nhóc khi đó mới mười lăm tuổi. ""The Reader"" làm mình chợt nhớ đến câu chuyện tình trong ""The Notebook"", hoặc cuốn phim lãng mạn ""The 50 First Dates"" khi anh chàng Henry Roth hàng ngày vẫn phải tự giới thiệu lại mình với cô nàng Lucy Whitmore vì cô nàng bị chứng mất trí nhớ ngắn hạn. Nhưng ""The Reader"" mạnh mẽ hơn thế và cũng vì thế mà bớt tính ""ngôn tình"" hơn. Nó là tình cảm giữa con người với con người, ngay cả khi họ không còn thực sự yêu nhau như cái thủa ban đầu nữa.Mình cũng xem phiên bản điện ảnh của The Reader do Stephen Daldry đạo diễn. Tác phẩm điện ảnh đã rất thành công trong việc chuyển tải nội dung, tư tưởng của văn học mà không phải là một bản review bằng hình cho văn học. Nó có sức sống riêng của nó. Cơ mà cũng do Kate Winslet quá xuất sắc nữa :D"

Que tipo de ser humano é Hanne?Foi por causa deste personagem conflituosa que apenas coloquei 3, pois a escrita do escritor merece 10 ou mais estrelas. Ele sabe construir historias. E abordar a segunda guerra é uma tarefa bem complexa, sobretudo quando se fala em holocausto.Michael é um jovem excepcional e a convivência com essa mulher transforma-o num homem brilhante. Que casa, tem uma filha e se forma em Direito. Mas apesar de todo tem sempre em mente a sua musa e a visita nos últimos dias da sua visita. é uma leitura bastante forte. Aconselho a o ler a partir dos 14 anos. Antes pode perturbar as suas mentes. E também as pessoas sensíveis é melhor deixar passar este livro. Haverá outros livros do mesmo escritor que vos agrade.  Apesar de todo. Classifico o livro como uma leitura marcante e uma boa estreia neste escritor. "
5194,2125085530,really liked it,"Somehow, I never saw this movie. While I knew the story dealt with sex, I knew nothing else about it at all. I found it interesting, and fun to listen to in my car. (Bonus, this unabridged version was about 4 hours, so it was perfect for the time I was in the car today without being in reach of an NPR station.) It occasionally dragged a bit, but caused me to think, which I believe to be the point of this book. It's about a 15-year old who engages in an affair with a 36-year old woman and falls in love, even though he knows little about her. Eventually they no longer see each other (no spoilers here!) and their paths cross once again several years later. This is yet one more novel about WWII, or at least its aftermath, and comes at it from a very different perspective. The central question about the decisions you make when you live in a country that is going the wrong way is pertinent to the US today. It also makes you question about how you live the rest of your life when you have a powerful, and pivotal, thing happen at such a young age. "
5194,1764975865,really liked it,"It was a lovely read, and turned out to be third time lucky, in my case.I had atttempted reading this book twice before, owing to the positive reviews by my friends, but the story somehow didn't catch my attention.I guess the time arrived finally, when I had a weekend theme challenge on Holocaust, and Girish suggested 'The Reader"". Till then, I hadn't even known that it dealt with the holocaust, and had pegged it down to a story of lust between a youngster and an older lady.The book is in 3 parts1. The initial meeting and the physical relationship thereafter, of a 15 year old boy and a woman in her 30s2. A trial involving Nazi concentration camp officers post WWII3. Reconciliation between the older woman and the younger man, who is now a middle aged father.Was a satisfying read, though not a happy one. Made me think of truth, half truth, guilt, redemption, personal devils and many more things that can't be categorized or quantified. "
5194,60089125,really liked it,"Following the tendency of the great books on the holocaust, such as Schindler's List by Thomas Keneally and The French Lieutenant's Woman by John Fowles , this books describes in a very touching way how the love story between Michel Berg and Hanna Schmitz survived after the end of World War II in Germany.A poignant movie was made based on this book: The Reader (2008) with Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, Bruno Ganz."

5194,744257937,liked it,"This book presented many interesting questions to the reader but left me cold.When I read a blurb that contains little tid bits such as: 'coiled eroticism' and the moral claims it makes upon the reader. 'a story of love and secrets', 'horror and compassion'.I get all kinds of excited!But whoever wrote the summary wrote a pretty big check that the book just could not cash.First of all, I live with a 15 year old. So not only was I squicked out by the 'coiled eroticism' but I was also left seriously doubting Mr. Schlink has (1) ever lived with a teenage boy and (2) remembers what it was like to be a teenage boy. I can guarantee you a teen never wonders if, while someone may not be objectively correct, they may be subjectively correct. They also do not worry that maybe they were wrong and offended someone.Nope the world is wrong and they are right no matter what....because seriously, they are teenagers.I understand this was a different time, this character lived in a different world. It was just too much a stretch for me and the message was lost.Lets take a look at the second half.This went much better for me. There were atrocities explored, moral questions were certainly presented and I had the feels on multiple occasions, there was even a good gut punch thrown in there.Why did the story have to be so clinical and stale?I definitely saw the contrast between 'before' and 'after' but once again the message was getting lost.I would never say this was a 'bad' book. It had a lot of amazing things to say. I just wish they were delivered a little differently. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the Holocaust. Those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it. This gives an interesting POV that I have not seen very often."

De twee beginnen een relatie, ze hebben daarbij een vast ritueel : eerst leest Michael haar voor, dan douchen ze samen en dan vrijen ze. Maar op een dag, zonder dat Michael dat heeft zien aankomen, verdwijnt Hanna uit zijn leven. Hij ziet haar pas terug wanneer hij als rechtstudent een Holocaust-proces bijwoont en daar Hanna in de geklaagdenbank ziet zitten.Het verhaal wordt in de ik-vorm verteld, Michael blikt terug op zijn leven en de impact die zijn ontmoeting met Hanna daarop gehad heeft..Het boek druipt van het thema schuld en schaamte. Het boek gaat ook over hoe de duitse, naoorlogse generatie probeert de vorige generatie ter verantwoording te roepen en het verleden probeert te verwerken.Alweer een mooi, zeer mooi geschreven verhaal. “De lagen van ons leven liggen zo dicht op elkaar dat we in het latere altijd het vroegere tegenkomen, niet als iets dat is afgedaan en afgehandeld, maar actueel en levend.”https://www.leestafel.info/bernhard-s..."

5194,1098640297,liked it,"SPOILERS AHEADThis one was strange for me. I went into it knowing next to nothing about it.I will start where the book starts: with Hanna & Michael's relationship. I just thought it was icky. To me, it wasn't erotic or passionate; it was a 36 year old woman using a 15 year old boy for sex. I found the balance of power off the whole time, no matter how much Michael said he was in love with Hanna - and Hanna made nearly no effort to reciprocate his feelings. I thought I was in love at the age of 15. With Justin Timberlake. Obviously, that never panned out for me, and having actually been in love later in life, I can now clearly say that I was not actually in love with Justin Timberlake.The thing is, though, that I can sort of relate to Michael. I was sick a lot as a kid. I spent a lot of time out of school. I was prone to pneumonia and three years running missed two or three weeks of school consecutively. After a prolonged illness that had me on my back for weeks, I was usually a little off for a while. My brain didn't always like to cooperate. Around the age of 15, I was also going through all the hormones that teenagers deal with - and having a bit of a sexual awakening. Having said all of this, I don't think Michael was entirely mentally sound when he decided that it would be a great idea to sleep with a stranger more than twice his age, just because he liked the way she put on her stockings. I also think that said stranger over twice his age, probably shouldn't have let him in her house while she was undressed, and then proceed to sleep with him.I HATED everything about their ""romantic"" relationship, which I didn't find remotely romantic. Hanna withheld herself, was moody and distant, and prone to fits of anger. I felt she held Michael to much too high expectations - if you're in a relationship with an adolescent, don't expect the behavior of an adult. And I was particularly upset when she flew off the handle on their vacation together and hit Michael in the face, splitting his lip. How people can say that there relationship was ""beautiful"" or in any way healthy is beyond me.We see the repercussions that the relationship had on Michael through the rest of the book. If it was such a beautiful relationship, why did he have so many issues later? He felt ashamed for not telling anyone about her, he felt guilty for not writing to her in prison, he felt guilty about her death - he felt so GUILTY and ASHAMED about EVERYTHING. Guilty and ashamed are not things that you should constantly feel if you're in love with someone.The second part of the book, I really enjoyed. I liked that the author explored the mentality of post-war Germany, and the ways the next generation were dealing with the sins of their parents. I found the trial interesting and informative. (This section is the reason this is shelved on my WW2 shelf.)One thing, though. Was anyone actually surprised by Hanna's big secret? I saw it coming almost instantly. I have heard that her illiteracy is supposed to be a metaphor for Germany's moral illiteracy during the war. If so... Whatever. It doesn't really change anything for me.By the third part, I just didn't care very much anymore. The only real question I had is this: why did Hanna even apply for clemency if she was just going to kill herself the day she was released? What is even the point? It seemed like she wanted Michael to rescue her - and I felt that way throughout the book. It all went back to an unhealthy relationship.Really, this is just 2.5 stars. 1.5 of those are for the second part. The rest combined is barely 1 star."

5194,725544641,really liked it,"The book tells of the affair between a fifteen year old boy, Michael Berg, and an older woman, Hanna Schmitz, in post WWII Germany. But for Michael it is an unrequited love what Hanna really enjoys is hearing him read to her.One day Hanna just up sticks and disappears, Michael goes back to his former life but later finds out that Hanna was a concentration camp guard during the conflict and is to stand trial for her actions during that time. Hanna has another secret that she is willing to keep hidden from anyone at all costs, she is iliterate.On first impressions this seems like any young man's fantasy coming true, an affair with an older more experienced woman but later Michael learns that there is a price to pay for it in his future life and relationships. The author,Berhard Sclink, is a German law professor but at all times he keeps the language simple and accessible. At times it is childlike at others erotic without being salacious. However, this is a tale with many layers including guilt, betrayal and responsibilty. Prominent is the focus on the difference between the two generations. Just how much how should post WWII children view the actions of German non-combatants during the conflict. In particular were they blameless as to the terrible deeds perpetrated at the concentration camps or were they by omission equally guilty?How do the actions of the past affect those of the future and who should sit in judgment if all are equally guilty? This question was brought in sharp relief for me by the words of the car driver who gives Michael a lift when he asks whether be believed that the prison guards were cruel in their deeds or merely concientious of doing a good job?Personally I felt that it was a very thought provoking book but a had a few problems with it. Firstly the books that Michael chose to read to Hanna seemed far too mature for a fifteen year old boy and I was left unimpressed with the court portion. In particular I found it hard to rationalize that a person would rather be seen as guilty of war crimes rather than to admit to being iliterate. That said I did find it enjoyable and may even go and watch the movie adaptation. Something that I have tried to avoid in the past. "

A 36 year old woman named Hanna spots his distress, cleans him up and walks him home. Michael lands in bed with hepatitis for several weeks and when he recovers his mom asks him to personally thank Hannah for her kindness. And boy does she ever . . .The two become bed-mates for a time and she enjoys listening to Michael read to her. Michael fancies himself a little in love with Hanna despite her odd, aloof behavior. He also struggles with keeping the affair a secret and behaving like a normal teenager. The affair comes to an end when Hanna spots Michael swimming with friends and doesn't acknowledge her. Hanna then disappears.Years later Michael is a law student sitting in a courtroom and learns that Hanna is on trial for murder and that she spent time as a concentration camp guard for the Nazi's. As the trial continues Michael realizes he knows a secret that can significantly reduce her sentence. But it's a secret that Hanna has kept to herself entire life and he's unsure if he should speak out when she refuses to defend herself.This is a story with some heavy moral dilemma's but it's ultimately a story of regret of wasted lives. It's a quick read but not one, I think, I will easily forget."
5194,42913132,really liked it,"In his thought-provoking exploration of Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung Schlink presents the reader with a number of moral conundrums as well as with compelling portraits of the two principal characters. Since the reader comes to know the characters and experience the conundrums from the point of view of the narrating character only, the reader must decide both the accuracy and the completeness of the assessments given. Called to judge the actions of both characters, the reader experiences the difficulty of letting ""justice pour down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream"" in a world in which both justice and righteousness have lost their deontological moorings. The author here adumbrates his fascination with Homer's Odyssey, a fascination that will find its full realization in his recent work, Homecoming. Coming to terms with the past and finding the way home are activities that resonate with Germans living in the aftermath of World War II and the reunification of Germany. In their struggle to understand the past and to reconcile it with their lived present there are lessons for us all. The book is required reading in Germany. I recommend it for anyone who has ever felt the rain. "
5194,135040005,it was ok,"It's difficult for me to rate this book, because it has an interesting premise, and touches interesting themes and topics and aims to provide plenty of food for thought.But it's also very dull. The characters are not characters, but the ideas of them. The prose is stripped down to bare essentials, and after a while becomes tiring to read. The book is short, and it's not a good thing in this case - nothing is fleshed out, and the whole thing feels like the author wrote down ideas and points he wanted to present and ornamented them in the barest rudiments of characterization and dialogue. The storytelling is practiaclly nonexistant here, and the book reads like a fragment from the diary of the protagonist (maybe that was intentional) but the situations that are so familiar and powerful to him leave the reader indifferent - we're never ""let in"" and therefore fail to feel anything for the characters and their dilemmas. I was not shocked, I was not moved, I was not even interested and in the end the only two words that I could say were ""So What?"""

La terza ed ultima parte, infine, vede il protagonista riallacciare i rapporti attraverso l’azione del leggere: lei è stata condannata all’ergastolo e lui le spedisce cassette in cui ha registrato la lettura di opere di vario genere.La letteratura è co-protagonista di questa storia drammatica. Le parole che sono rimaste scritte nel tempo da romanzieri e poeti si fanno suono. ” Leggere un dramma ad alta voce, in modo da rendere riconoscibili e abbastanza vivi i personaggi, richiede una certa concentrazione.”Bernhard/ Michael ed Hanna sono travolti da un’irrazionale passione carnale e fra loro si stabilisce da subito un rituale erotico che fa precedere l’atto sessuale dal reciproco lavarsi. All’improvviso questo rituale si arricchisce di un particolare che è per l’appunto la lettura ad alta voce. Il rapporto tra i due è totalmente asimmetrico: Hanna impone il suo essere adulta con forza e ogni occasione è buona per rimarcare che è lei a comandare. Il suo desiderio di avere una cultura è bloccato dall’analfabetismo (che lui scoprirà più avanti) e, in questo senso, Bernhard/ Michael diventa strumento di conoscenza con una piccola modifica del loro rituale:” Hanna volle sapere che cosa studiavo a scuola. Le raccontai dei poemi omerici, delle orazioni di Cicerone e della storia scritta da Hemingway dove si parla del vecchio e della sua lotta col pesce e col mare. Lei voleva sentire come suonavano il greco e il latino, e io le lessi dei brani dall'""Odissea"" e dalle ""Orazioni contro Catilina"".«Studi anche il tedesco?».«Cosa vuoi dire con questo?».«Studi solo lingue straniere o c'è qualcosa da studiare anche nella propria lingua?».«Leggiamo dei testi». Mentre ero ammalato, la classe aveva letto l'""Emilia Galotti"" e ""Intrigo e amore"", da cui bisognava poi trarre un elaborato. Dovevo quindi leggermi i due drammi, e lo feci quando tutto il resto fu portato a termine. Ma ormai era tardi e io ero stanco, e quel che leggevo non lo ricordavo più già il giorno dopo, per cui dovevo leggerlo un'altra volta.«Leggimelo!».«Leggilo da te, ti porto il testo».«Tu hai una voce così bella, ragazzino, preferisco ascoltarti che leggere da me».«Mah, non so».Ma quando arrivai il giorno dopo e feci per baciarla, lei si scansò. «Prima devi leggermi».Faceva sul serio. Dovetti leggerle per mezz'ora l'""Emilia Galotti"", prima che mi prendesse con sé sotto la doccia e a letto.” Leggere ad alta voce sarà un modo diverso di esprimersi e condividere delle emozioni. Come un alfabeto segreto che appartiene solo agli amanti e che perdura nel tempo a dispetto di ciò che succede.Al di là della storia personale, c’è anche un valore storico in questo scritto. Quello che attesta le atmosfere della generazione che succede al Terzo Reich e che tenta di scrollarsi di dosso le colpe dei padri e la sensazione spiacevole della vergogna che è rimasta appiccicata addosso. Schlink riporta il clima universitario in cui si dibattevano questi temi. Schlink è fra coloro che non voleva puntare il dita contro nessuno.Schlink pensa:  lo scontro con il passato nazista non fosse il motivo di fondo, ma soltanto l'espressione del conflitto generazionale, la forza motrice del movimento studentesco. Le aspettative dei genitori, di cui ogni generazione deve liberarsi, venivano semplicemente liquidate col fatto che quei genitori avevano fallito sotto il Terzo Reich, o al più tardi dopo la sua fine.”Mah?●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●  Commento 1- Quello da ★ ★  Ma leggere a voce alta può coprire le voci di chi chiede giustizia?Una grande passione che da carnale si fa interprete di emozioni più profonde può mettere a tacere l’ignominia?Lascia l’amaro in bocca questo tentativo di riabilitare, giustificare ciò che è essenzialmente inaccettabile.Hanna ha 36 anni e seduce un ragazzino di 15 anni (fa differenza il fatto che lui dimostri un paio d’anni di più?). Il fatto che sia una donna adulta e non uomo a sedurre fa sembrare tutto più accettabile per cui si legge con trasporto di questo amore a cui tutto in fondo viene perdonato. Disseminate qua là troviamo considerazioni dell’orrore ma non c’è il disgusto per aver amato una persona che ha commesso l’impensabile. Razionalmente Bernhard/ Michael sa ma emotivamente non ha idea di dove andare a parare: non elabora una critica anche quando viene a conoscenza dei fatti.Hanna rifiuta una promozione alla Siemens e si offre come volontaria nelle S.S.: beh, poverina non sapeva leggere! Come poteva svolgere un incarico di responsabilità? Non aveva altre scelte…Hanna sceglie ragazzine deboli destinate ai forni per leggerle brani ad alta voce: è stata compassionevole! A concesso loro un ultimo periodo gradevole prima della morte a cui erano destinate…C’è una macchia che si allarga nel procedere di questa lettura. Un sussurro che si fa sempre più insistente e che alla fine grida: «Sì, Hanna è colpevole ma, poverina, cercate di capire!».No. No!Io non capisco, anzi non voglio capire…  Conclusioni- non metto neanche una stelletta  Il mio giudizio è scisso: ● Mi ha coinvolto la presenza della letteratura; l’uso della voce che porta oltre a quella che sarebbe stata una mera relazione erotica; la legittima riflessione di una generazione che aveva ereditato -per tempi e luoghi- un debito senza averne colpe dirette.● Non posso appoggiare una posizione in merito alla tematica dell’Olocausto così arrendevole. Schlink sembra dire: «Perché dovrei martoriarmi se non ne ho colpa diretta?».In fondo Schlink per liberarsi di un peso che è del tutto personale, ossia il rimorso per aver ricominciato la relazione con Hanna anche dopo:” Io avevo concesso ad Hanna una piccola nicchia, sì, una nicchia, che era importante per me, che mi dava qualcosa e per la quale io facevo qualcosa, ma non le avevo riservato un posto nella mia vita.Ma perché non le avevo concesso un posto nella mia vita? Mi rivoltai contro la coscienza sporca che mi sentivo montare al pensiero di averla ridotta a una nicchia. “"

5194,224897938,it was amazing,"My review: 4.5 of 5 starsBook + Movie Review – The ReaderBoth book and movie discussed in detail so be aware of spoilers!
’I’m not frightened. I’m not frightened of anything. The more I suffer, the more I love. Danger will only increase my love. It will sharpen it, forgive its vice. I will be the only angel you need. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say: Only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love.’
It’s rare that I ever decide to read the book after having already watched the movie. After watching ‘The Reader’ and loving it I did feel that the book would do a much better job at conveying the emotions (as is normal with books vs. movies) and I so wanted to experience that.Compared to the book, I felt the movie really lacked in sufficiently presenting the true emotion behind Michael’s actions. What was disconcerting to me at first was when Michael was first introduced he seemed to me like a silly boy with a crush (even though yes, he was only 15) and their relationship was not easily understandable in the least. Kate Winslet won an Academy Award for her role in this movie, and for good reason. She did an absolutely amazing job at playing the part of Hanna Schmitz, a shadowy and secretive woman. She was dynamic and incredible but also strange; you never truly understand her actions until all is revealed. And once revealed, well, my heart broke for her.Michael and Hanna’s relationship on film and on print was fiery and despite their taboo relationship was still full of passion. The fact that their relationship was taboo was never really addressed in either the book or movie. Of course they kept their relationship secret but they never went to great lengths in order to keep it that way. When they went on vacation together Michael referenced the fact that he could say she was his mother but was still unable to stop himself form kissing her on the lips in the full light of day. It could be interpreted either as the thrill of doing something he knows is wrong/taboo but I think it was more the fact that he was so incredibly happy to be with her that he was willing to take any chance. One scene in particular I found to be quite ironic was where Michael was reading to her and it was a very detailed sex scene. She stops him and says, “This is disgusting. Where did you get this?” Michael responds, “Borrowed it from someone at school.” Hanna says, “Well, you should be ashamed.”A few scenes in particular were missing from the movie that I felt were vital elements of the story as a whole. For one, the philosophical conversation between Michael and his father. It was clear he was dealing with some heavy decisions throughout the entirety of the trial but it went deeper than it was portrayed on film. In the book when he was struggling to decide whether or not to come forward about Hanna’s illiteracy his father said to him:
“...I see absolutely no justification for setting other peoples views of what is good for them above their own ideas of what is good for themselves.”
The conversation instead occurred between him and his teacher, but I don’t feel it had the needed effect that the conversation with his father caused in the book.The single most vital scene that I felt was missing in the movie was the scene at the pool when he saw Hanna for the last time. That last encounter set in motion the guilt that would haunt him for the rest of his life. The fact that he failed to acknowledge her in front of his friends was the whole reason he thought she had left and that he had drove her away by his inaction. There were a few other various details that were changed in the movie (like the ending) but nonetheless, I felt it was a remarkable book to movie portrayal. I felt that both the book and movie were brilliantly done and is one of the few instances where both can be appreciated in their own regards."

5194,1839554855,really liked it,"2017 Reading Challenge #2: A book that's been on your TBR list foy way too long.Estoy convencida de que los libros de alguna manera nos hablan de nosotros. Que los grandes autores conocen bien ese recurso que puede ser expreso o no, de apelar a nuestra experiencia, a nuestros sentimientos o a nuestras ideas más arraigadas para así seducirnos con las historias que vamos leyendo.Enmarcada en la Alemania postnazi, inicia la crónica de Michael Berg, un muchacho de quince años que se enamora de Hanna, una mujer de treinta y seis años a la que conoce por designios del azar. Acontece entre ambos un apasionado affaire, donde él descubre el deseo y el placer en sus idílicos encuentros y ella le conquista y somete de un modo casi imperceptible para un chiquillo, a la vez que le pide que lea en voz alta antes de amarse. Así se definen, en esta primera parte, dos personajes perfectamente humanos. Apreciamos conforme pasan los días, cómo el muchacho oscila entre la confianza y las inseguridades que suscitan una relación con una persona mayor, hasta que llega el fin de su amorío cuando de un momento a otro, Hanna desaparece sin dejar rastro.El lector es una lectura ligera, capítulos cortos que se siguen en un ritmo continuo y sin ambages, pero que dejan entrever cierta profundidad psicológica y filosófica que finalmente se despliegan en la segunda parte, en donde una vez más el destino reúne a los amantes, en esta oportunidad en un juicio donde Michael, ahora estudiante de Derecho, presencia la acusación contra cinco mujeres entre las cuales se cuenta Hanna, por crímenes cometidos en campos de concentración en los que fueran guardianas.A partir de aquí no hay tregua posible: Michael se debate entre la compresión y la condena, la compasión y la justicia; trata de descubrir quién es en realidad la mujer a la que amó y qué le llevó a cometer esas atrocidades. El autor deslumbra con una maestría no solo para construir personajes verosímiles y vivos, sino también para sumirnos en esa amalgama de sentimientos que producen semejantes heridas abiertas en la historia, que van desde la vergüenza y la culpa hasta la intransigencia y la arrogancia. El final aunque es concebible, no deja de de ser inesperado y melancólico.

A veces un final un final doloroso hace que el recuerdo traicione la felicidad pasada. A lo mejor es que la única felicidad verdadera es la que dura para siempre. Porque solo puede tener un final doloroso lo que ya era doloroso de por sí, aunque no fuéramos conscientes de ello, aunque lo ignorásemos.

Más allá de la tenacidad y las temáticas que abarca este libro, creo que es esencialmente recomendable por su capacidad revolver tantas emociones y dilemas que enfrentamos siendo jóvenes o adultos, que se superan o se arrastran, pero que en definitiva nos revelan más humanos.Una lectura realmente significativa."
5194,71108387,it was ok,"It's funny, when stories like this happen in literature, they're touching, moving stories of the heart. But when they happen on the six o'clock news they're horrific stories of pedophilic rape between, say, a female schoolteacher and a student, and we gasp audibly, loud enough at least to make sure everyone hears. It's interesting how our sympathies change in these contexts, and the fact that we eat both of them up with intrigued hunger probably says something about latent desires we all have but won't admit.The Reader has all the elements of tried-and-true mechanical emotional manipulation: Age-gap love; freeze-dried just-add-water idyllic imagery of the lovers biking along the country road, their hair caught by the wind; protagonists who like reading; and, not insignificantly, a Holocaust backstory. It's all the stuff of Miramax ""art"" films and the NPR crowd. So, it's not surprising that Mr. Miramax himself, Harvey Weinstein, produced the film adaptation; the book reads like a skeletal treatment for one of his films.The book is an easy read; smooth as butter -- at least in the first half -- and sometimes lovely. And it's hard not to feel the sadness of the protagonist with his memories, regrets and the sense of betrayal of a love that was not quite what it seemed to be, or, which was exactly what it seemed to be despite the revelation of hard facts unknown at the time. But the book's tricks begin to show fairly early on -- the ease with which, for instance, he reduces and boils down the essence of their relationship to four bits of imagery should be charming but strikes me as a calculated and disingenuous trope -- and because of that I felt myself pulled away from the gravitas of the story; looking at it from a cool distance and refusing to let my emotions be pulled in and engaged. The book's so-called big revelations were telegraphed clearly and I'd seen them far in advance. It's impossible to really discuss what happens in the second half of the book without revealing spoilers. The second half degenerates into clunky, distanced and pedestrian storytelling and is less interesting than the more poetic first half, which at least benefits from a sense of concentrated longing. The details of Michael Berg's adult life are a complete bore and almost irrelevant to the story. The flavor of the trial is poorly captured due to the lack of dialogue that would give it more palpable drama. I think, overall, it's a fairly minor book; it adds little that's new to Holocaust lit, and all of you who were suckered by it can go back to your tea and your NPR."

El Juicio a la Memoria Histórica de un Pueblo entrelazado con una historia de amor y obsesión, culpa y redención


Comienzo
Trama ResumidaUn chico, Michael, se enamora de una mujer mayor, Ana, iniciandose sexualmente con ella y en cierto modo convirtiéndola en su primer amor. La mujer le pide que le lea en cada encuentro, lo cual da a su relación un tinte especial,de una mayor intimidad. Un dia ella desaparece, dejándolo pasmado y dolido.Años depués,cuando Michael estudia para graduarse de abogado asiste a ciertos juicios de diversos acusados de participar en el gobiero Nazi y en los campos de concetración. Ahi encontrará a Ana, su ex-amante, acusada de ser celadora en un campo y de haber autorizado y permitido, junto a otras mujeres, la muerte de un grupo de judíos atrapados en un iglesia, a la cual sus compañeras prendieron fuego. En medio del juicio interno que Michael hace de toda la sociedad que rodeó y permitió el Gobierno Nazi y sus atrocidades (inclyendo a sus padres ¿son encubridores? ¿pudieron denunciar el hecho? ¿ debieron oponerse al régimen? ¿sabían de""la solución final""?) y de si mismo por haber amado a una de sus participantes activas,descubre el secreto que podría salvarla...Excelente novela que trata de el juicio a la memoria histórica de un pueblo,junto a una historia de culpa, redención y muerte.The End: ¡¡Te odio Michael Berg!!! Excelente novela, el final me produjo una emoción tan onda, que me quede fría... Candidata a segunda lectura y a comprar mi copia (esta es la biblioteca)
Frase que resume la novela
""Siempre he tenido la impresión de que nadie me entendía, de que nadie sabía quién era yo y qué me había llevado a la situación en que estaba. ¿Y sabes una cosa? cuando nadie te entiende, tampoco te pueden pedir cuentas nadie. Pero los muertos si.Ellos si que te entienden. No hace falta que estuvieran allí, pero si estuvieron te entienden mejor aún. Aquí en la cárcel estaban conmigo constantemente. Venían cada noche aunque no siempre los esperaba. Antes del juicio todavía podía ahuyentarlos cuando querían venir"" - Ana4.5 estrellas de 5 y 6/7 castillos, NotableP.S.

5194,56482079,it was amazing,"I've read Le Liseur twice now in its French translation from the German. The film The Reader tracks the novel quite closely, with the only significant change one that comes at the very end, when Michael visits Hanna's grave. In the film he is accompanied by his daughter. In the novel, he goes alone. The story is a disturbing one, with its ultimately unanswered questions regarding guilt, shame, betrayal and responsibility. The novel can be read as the personal story of Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz set in post-war Germany, but it can also be read as an allegory in which Hanna represents Germany, the country itself, and the generation of the parents, those who were adults during the Hitler years. Michael represents the next generation who were children or not yet born during the war. It is the lack of an accounting, of memory on the part of the parents’ generation that ultimately victimizes Michael and future generations, as their own silence and betrayal is a product of that of parents who didn't confront the past, who just moved on. This betrayal of memory on the part of the German populace after WWII is a subject that has been effectively explored by the writer, W.G. Sebald. Michael Berg is 15 when he becomes involved with Hanna, who at 36 is 21 years his senior. He initiates the relationship, but Hanna, as the adult, may be exploiting, and in a sense raping, him nonetheless. Hanna’s secret and her secret shame is her illiteracy, an, unexplained in the novel, handicap which determines the course of her life, including her employment as a concentration camp guard during WWII and her later condemnation and imprisonment for what she did there. In fact, Hanna ultimately admits to more responsibility than she actually had in events surrounding a terrible fire in a locked church that killed all but two of the Jewish prisoners guarded by Hanna and several other women. Rather than admit her inability to read either the accusations against her or the book written by a girl who, along with her mother, survived the fire, Hanna is sentenced to life in prison.The course of Michael Berg’s life is determined, in turn, by his relationship with Hanna and his feelings of betrayal both of her and by her.

O quando ti accorgi che tutta la parte del processo è talmente asettica e fredda e ti consideri fortunata a serbare la prima impressione del film, dove invece era viva, esisteva una reazione visibile e un lavorio interiore di Hanna che ci era concesso vedere, come esisteva lo sgomento di Michael che qui sembra quasi assente, e ti dispiace che in generale il film abbia molti più impulsi ""di petto"" rispetto al libro. Inutile andare a vedere il pelo nell'uovo quando ti accorgi che era molto meglio come il film aveva disposto gli eventi invece che quelli nel libro. Non si può dire che al nocciolo siano due storie diverse con due interpretazioni diverse, sono bene o male molto, ma molto simili, solo il film di Stephen Daldry mi disse molto di più: forse è anche questa sensibilità tedesca più rigida, più squadrata, che magari messa in mano ad un americano (o semplicemente un non-tedesco) si slega un po' e in qualche modo mi risulta più intensa. Poi non so se questa cosa dello stereotipo della sensibilità tedesca tutta rigida e piena di contegno sia una realtà effettivamente ed attualmente presente o solo una sorta di stereotipo. Eppure c'è qualcosa di riscontrabile."

Então quando decidi ler o livro já tinha uma vaga ideia que iria marcar-me profundamente. Adorei o ambiente da estória; a escrita do autor toca-nos profundamente e as personagens são soberbas. A Hanna e o Michael vão permanecer comigo durante vários anos, tenho a certeza. O final destruíu-me completamente. E para que ficasse ainda mais destruída, mal acabei de ler o livro tive que ir ver novamente o filme. E pronto, chorei tanto que no dia seguinte tinha os olhos tao inchados que ate me custava abri-los. Os actores foram excelentes. Enfim, é uma estória poderosa, que nos faz questionar as opções que escolhemos ao longo da vida. Mas sobretudo faz-nos pensar no impacto que um relacionamento, por mais curto que seja, com outra pessoa pode ter para sempre na nossa vida. Sem duvida que ficou um favorito da vida."

Hanna al principio me parecía una mujer muy fría y egoísta, pero me quede a cuadros cuando se descubre el pastel. Se podría decir que despertó en mí sentimientos encontrados, por una parte y sin contar lo que hizo en el pasado, me daba mucha pena y entendía muchas cosas que hace, pero no puedo dejar a un lado lo que hizo y eso me producía mucha rabia, me dolía mucho lo que hizo y eso no tiene justificación alguna. Por otra parte tenemos a Michael, un personaje que no lo entendí mucho, es un poco raro. Al final del libro, se entiende muchas cosas sobre sus sentimientos de amor/culpa, pero lo sigo sintiendo extraño.La historia también me ha tenido con sentimientos encontrados: me gusta la historia que cuenta y como la cuenta pero no puedo olvidar el pasado, es demasiado cruel para olvidarlo.

The Reader was so sensuous, sexy, disturbing, and conflicting. There are so many more words to describe how it made me feel during the reading of this book. Words that I cannot think of, cannot capture in my mind and put in this review. My feelings are simply indescribable. Time spent writing a review of this book is simply a waste of time for me because I just do not know what to say. There are other reviews which go into depth of the multiple issues brought up by the author Berhard Schlink. Just let me say that it should be your next book read. "

Dar porą savaičių galvoje sukosi kas ir kaip. Ir dabar vėl prisiminus viską galvoja tarsi užverda mintys.Pagrindiniai du klausimai perskaičius knygą man išliko: O ką aš būčiau darius jos vietoj? Ir ar paaiškėjus jos paslapčiai, įrodančiai jos nekaltumą, kažkas būtų pasikeitę? Tai knyga kuri nepaleido manęs dar ilgai."

Logra eludir, sin ahondar, al contexto histórico de la Alemania de la posguerra, evocando preconcepciones ya enraizadas en la cultura occidental acerca del resentimiento hacia la generación que albergó al nazismo. En opinión personal, el mayor logro del texto es elevar cuestionamientos jurídicos, filosóficos y morales que cimbran la opinión generalizada y llevan a revalorizar, replantear y rejuzgar a partícipes del nazismo. La historia de amor que subraya el escrito es pasional, ingenua y adolescente, pero escapa la obsesión. Es mero devenir, maduración, agonía procesal. "

The events in this novel span from the time the narrator is an adolescent until he is middle-aged, yet his voice and perspective remain the same throughout the book. Maybe he is just not very bright and lacks the ability to look back on his younger self. Or maybe it is to do with the translation. If you have nothing better read, go for it, otherwise pass on it."

5194,2366141346,it was amazing,"This book was given to me at the end of high school by my favourite teacher (of literature) as a farewell and encouragement for the studying years to come. I did not really liked it at the time - the Holocaust was a subject I disliked to read about, having done too much about WWII in school. Plus it is not a very pleasant topic. I read it, I forgot it. I then saw the movie, it's a good one!Fast forward a few years and I saw the audiobook version of it in my local library. I thought that having ""the reader"" read to me was an interesting mise en abyme. I heard it again & watched the movie again.It's a very interesting story about guilt. The one of the people who partook in the Holocaust, even though by mere circumstances, & the one of the generation that followed. The character of Hanna is hard to understand & I still can't really decide about how I feel about her. (view spoiler)[ Her suicide made me sad, but at the same time had a feel of justice about it - like she had finally recognised the pain she had partook in inflicting. Sure, she paid by going to prison, for something she was not fully responsible for, but it feels like she only understood what she had done once she read about the testimonies. Shame she did not make things right by Michael. (hide spoiler)]Also, re-discovering this book have prompt me to write to my teacher after all these years to thank her for the good influence she had on me, tell her about my life now and asking about hers. We (as a modern society & myself as an individual) complain so so much about everything & sometimes it's good to stop, feel & express some gratitude about what we have been given in life. Esp. in light of the horrors society has done (is doing now?) & how lucky we are to have not lived through them but simply read about it in the comfort of our reading sofa.If you have read this review until the end (thanks!), maybe take some time to think of someone who has had a good influence on you & write/text/email them about it. You will see that it makes you and them feel really good."
5194,2534120588,it was amazing,"“So I was still guilty. And if I was not guilty because one cannot be guilty of betraying a criminal, then I was guilty of having loved a criminal.” A long time ago I have seen a movie, ""The Reader"", with Kate Winslet playing one of the main characters, Hanna Schmitz. I thought the movie was stunning and Kate Winslet gave a performance of her lifetime, later rewarded by an Oscar. I must say that the book is just as a good as the movie. It is very philosophical, full of thoughts and analysis of past events, sometimes read as a stream of consciousness. The book is comprised of several parts. The first part reminded me a lot of ""Call me by your name"" - it talks in detail about a forbidden and passionate love affair between the main protagonist Michael, who at the time is 15 year old, with Hanna Schmitz, a 30+ German woman. This part is very subtle, nostalgic and full of raw emotion, despite the fact that it is an illicit affair. The next part takes place years later when Hanna is put on a trial along with other SS guards for the crimes she has committed in a concentration camp she worked back in 1944. That part is much more philosophical and explores tough moral questions as well as aspects of guilt and remorse that second-generation Germans have to deal with after the war was over. Michael ponders all this in addition to questioning and reassessing his feelings for Hanna now that he knows what she was involved in during the war. This book was incredibly thought-provoking and made me sympathize and try to understand Hanna despite the horrible crimes she has committed. I am surprised by the relatively low rating this book has - I highly recommend it as a very valuable and unforgettable read!"
5194,2692953681,liked it,"Aan interessante thema’s geen gebrek, en wat mij nog het meest intrigeerde, is dat dit boek een beeld schept van het schuldgevoel waar Duitsland mee opgezadeld zat na de holocaust, zelfs bij die generaties die er niets mee te maken hadden.Dat het boek, ondanks deze thema’s, me toch niet 100% wist te raken, is vreemd. Ik vermoed dat het komt door de schrijfstijl van Bernhard Schlink. Als ik er een woord voor kan bedenken, is het ‘degelijk’. Maar met ‘degelijkheid’ schrijf je geen fantastisch boek.Van dit boek valt een emotioneler, sprankelender geheel te maken. Nu (be)schrijft Schlink met een zekere afstandelijkheid. Een afstandelijk boek werkt voor mij maar als de afstandelijkheid op een bepaald moment (hoe kort ook, zie The Remains of the Day) doorbroken wordt. Of als het boek zich focust op ideeën, maar daarvoor is dit boek dan weer te kort en niet diepgravend genoeg.Ik dénk dat dat mijn probleem was met dit boek. Het is een verhaal dat enorm veel potentieel bevat om uitgesproken krachtig te zijn, maar het wordt gewoon te neutraal overgebracht. Ik heb de film nog niet gezien, maar het zou me niet verbazen mocht die (met dit basismateriaal) me wel meer raken. Al begrijp ik wel niet goed dat Ralph Fiennes (°1962) iemand speelt die 21 jaar jonger is dan Kate Winslet (°1975). Maar dit terzijde."
5194,2166703718,it was amazing,"""Právě proto, že mi byla natolik blízká i vzdálená zároveň, jsem ji nechtěl navštívit. Měl jsem pocit, že tím, čím pro mě je, může být jenom na velikou vzdálenost. Měl jsem strach, že malý, vzdušný a bezpečný svět pozdravů a kazet je natolik umělý a zranitelný, že skutečnou blízkost nevydrží. Jak bychom se měli setkat tváří v tvář, aniž by nevyšlo na povrch vše, co se mezi námi stalo."" V poslednom čase sa mi darí vyberať si knihy, ktoré ma celkom osobne zasiahnu a toto bola jedna z nich. Prinútila ma spomenúť si na veci síce dosť odlišné, ale aj tak vlastne vždy tak trochu trápne rovnaké. Okrem príbehu zvláštnej lásky (neskôr poznačenej tajomstvom, hanbou, útekom, zhnusením, ale aj vernosťou a súcitom) ma zaujala hlavne druhá časť, ako úvaha o vysporiadavaní sa s (nacistickou) minulosťou, či už osobnou, alebo spoločenskou a aj o tom, ako veľmi je to zložité. ""Četl jsem tehdy znovu Odysseu, kterou jsem poprvé otevřel ve škole a uchoval si v paměti příběh o návratu domů. Jak by mohli Řekové, kteří věděli, že do stejné řeky nelze stoupit dvakrát, věřit na nějaký návrat domů? Odysseus se domů nevrací proto, aby zde zůstal, ale aby se opět vydal na cestu. Odyssea je příběh pohybu, zároveň cíleného i bezcílného, úspěšného i marného."""
5194,2276552449,liked it,"I watched the movie, The Reader, over ten years ago and had put the book on my to read list. I recently pick this copy up at a second hand store and found myself quickly reading as I forgot some of the story line. I have mixed feelings about this book and I think that might have been the authors goal. The Reader is set in post WWII Germany and deals with the aftermath and consequences of a Nazi run country as the next generation is trying to come to terms with the Holocaust. The book is almost entirely an inner dialogue by Michael from the age of 15 until later on in his adult life. He attempts to come to terms with a childhood rendezvous with an older woman. This portion of the book was difficult for me to process because the sexual exploitation he experienced at a young age really defined who he became, but he didn't seem to fully understand that. The second half of the book deals with post WWII trials and really looked at who should be responsible for their actions.I would recommend this book, but a fair warning that it is not for the faint of heart. If you like books filled with action, character dialogue, and big plot twists then this book is not for you. If you enjoy historical fiction and want be forced to examine your inner thoughts in regards to morality while getting into the soul of the narrator, then this book is for you!"

5194,47820355,really liked it,"I haven't seen the movie yet, only a preview on a DVD a few weeks ago* (which reminded me I had the book on my shelf), but I have to say: while reading this I kept thinking God this would make a great film! And Kate Winslet would be great as Hanna! I like to think that if the movie hadn't already been made and put the idea in my head, it would have been a prophetic thought.When Michael Berg was fifteen he became sick with Hepatitis; several months of convalescence later, he goes back to visit the woman who helped him when he threw up on the street, to thank her. A quiet, strong woman in her thirties, Hanna works as a tram conductor and lives a solitary life. Catching a glimpse of her taking off her stockings, Michael flees in shame when she notices him looking. But a week of obsessing over her sees him returning, and they quickly become lovers.He keeps his relationship with her a secret. At her insistence, he picks up his studies and manages to make up for his lost time while sick. He loves Hanna and, in a way, feels she has ruined him for any other woman - which becomes clear when Hanna suddenly disappears and Michael tries to move on. While at university studying law, he takes part in a seminar which involves sitting in on a trial of people accused of war crimes when with the Nazis during World War II. He has spent so long cultivating a dispassionate, cold shell that Michael feels nothing when he sees that one of the women on trial is Hanna.He is there for every day of the trial, but only once do they make eye contact. He can't understand why Hanna is not defending herself as well as she could, why she is letting the other women on trial blame her for everything - until he realises what her real secret, her real shame is. If he explained it to the judge, there would be no way Hanna could be convicted of these heinous crimes at Auschwitz and another labour camp - but he wrestles with his moral and ethical right to do so.Schlink was born in 1944 and is a Law Professor in Berlin. Certainly, while reading this, I felt like the author had been there, seen that. Narrated by Michael at some later stage in his life, it reads like a real life - and in a way it is: a great many lives given voice in one slim novel. One of the questions Michael raises concerns the children, like himself, of the generation who sat by and did nothing while the Nazis persecuted and plundered. I never really thought about it before, but I can imagine, thanks to Michael, how hard it would have been for this post-war generation to respect their parents, and understand them without having lived through it themselves to truly know what it must have been like.Apart from that, this book - and Michael - doesn't judge. The relationship between a fifteen year old and a woman twice his age isn't judged - neither is it ever exposed. Hanna's involvement in Auschwitz is judged by the court but not by Michael, who instead tries to understand Hanna and her motivations. He also tries to understand his own feelings for Hanna, but is often lost in the nostalgia of his adolescent love affair. The Reader isn't about black and white, or good and evil - it's about all the grey bits that make up the moral and ethical complexities and contradictions of humans. It isn't about having a conclusion, about coming to a final understanding, but the process of reaching an understanding and the futility of a conclusion.I admit that as I was reading this I didn't pay much attention to the details, only to the narrative and the characters. I wouldn't be surprised if there are many things I overlooked, symbolism and recurring themes and such. On a re-read, I would focus more closely on what else Michael chooses to tell us, and why. This would be a great novel to study: deceptively simple, it harbours secrets barely tapped at.*Rented the movie a few weeks ago but only got halfway through. It was disappointing because, though done well and the acting was great etc., it was just a visualisation of the book and gave/offered nothing new. "
5194,57819509,it was ok,"As a general rule, I consider the word “erotic” in any book publicist lingo a euphemism for soft porn, so when I perused the description of Bernhard Schlink’s novel I wasn’t sure if it would be worth bothering with despite its intriguing (to a booklady such as myself) title. The first half of the book did indeed seem to fit my expectations of little more than titillation under the guise of literary searching. However, if the reader (small “R”) can overlook the blatant sexuality inherent in a young man’s premature and blighted ‘awakening’ which predominates the beginning of The Reader, there are aspects of the book which definitely make it worthwhile.Michael Bern is fifteen when he meets Hanna Schmitz, who is more than twice his age. What starts off as a physical affair turns into something quite different, a voyage of discovery through the Great Books of Literature. Homer’s Odyssey provides the thematical basis for the rest of the book which is that although our destiny is ever homeward, in fact we can never return to the same ‘home’ and certainly we can’t if we intend to reach this – or any – destination via physical or mental means. Indeed, the entire purpose of Literature is to change anyone who steps into its proverbial river. In this respect, Schlink’s novel is an archetype in much the same vein as Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress ; one will be both the richer – and the poorer (in terms of lost innocence) – for setting out on a journey of reading. I believe that is why both authors tie sexuality to the art of reading. Valuable insights/qualities in The Reader include: the folly and volatility of youthful self-perception; the complexity of the human creature, i.e., the fallen from Grace still possess a great desire to do Good, see Justice and know Truth; unanswerable questions, at least to those lacking any spiritual dimension or basis and a severe critique on books and reading.Based on my initial prejudices about this book I obtained it from the library as opposed to purchasing my own copy in which I usually highlight favorite quotes, outline and/or make notes to myself. As such, I was forced to make use of removable page tabs to indicate notable passages; I stopped marking such places when I reached fifteen. However, the ultimate insight can be found on page 157. A more mature Michael is trying to come to grips with Hanna’s role in The Holocaust and his own shared responsibility for her crimes, despite the fact he was born after World War II. Here is what he says:‘I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna’s crime and condemn it. But it was too terrible for that. When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned. When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding. But even as I wanted to understand Hanna, failing to understand her meant betraying her all over again. I could not resolve this. I wanted to pose myself both tasks—understanding and condemnation. But it was impossible to do both.’ Indeed, perhaps that also describes the position I find myself in as a reviewer of The Reader. As an incredibly insightful book which I did not like, I’ve struggled with how to rate it. Ultimately, I’m settling on two stars but only as a compromise between my distaste for the story's somewhat cynical and morose perspective and my appreciation of the truths the author offers. I am reminded of Sophie Scholl and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, two German martyrs of the same era who found something worth living – and dying – for much greater than reading."
5194,134300073,it was amazing,"Preview…I chose to delve into Bernhard Schlink’s novel “The Reader,” because, at only 218 pages, it seemed like a short and sweet selection. Although the actual word count was small, the story within was huge on meaning and teeming with deeply resonating themes. I found myself setting it down, time and time again, so that I could reflect on a series of particularly poignant passages.“The Reader” is a novel told in three parts. We begin with our narrator at age 15, growing up in the precarious climate of post-war Germany. Coming home from school one day, Michael becomes overwhelmed by sickness. An unknown woman cleans him up and sees him safely home.Later on Michael seeks out this woman to offer his thanks. Although there is a 21-year age difference between the boy and his benefactor, Hanna, the sexual attraction is undeniable. The two give themselves to each other physically, while holding back on the emotional entanglements of love. For months they continue on with their routine affair, which includes Hanna bathing Michael, Michael reading aloud to Hanna from various works of classic literature, and the two consummating their amorphous relationship. Until, without any warning, Hanna completely disappears.Years later, their paths intersect once more. As a young law student, Michael is observing the war crime trials of a group of female SS guards pertaining to a specific atrocity that led to the deaths of more than 300 Jewish women. Hanna is among the accused.Michael is sent into frenzied introspection. How could he have ever cared for such a heartless criminal? Was it just Hanna, whom he loved undeservingly, or should he have held back love to all of his elders involved in this tumultuous time period, everyone including his own parents though they were not active participants?Michael is haunted by his memory of Hanna, unable to carry-on healthy adult relationships. He doesn’t know whether to be angry at her for spoiling his innocence, and he doesn’t know how he feels now upon reflection. Unable to escape her ubiquitous presence in his mind, he strikes up a clouded correspondence with her. He reads aloud to her, just as they had always done before. Recording his dictations, he mails the tapes to her in prison with no formal salutations or small talk — just the tapes.Upon Hanna’s approaching release from prison, Michael must determine what the nature of their relationship is and whether or not to allow her into his life once more. Now, as it has been throughout her entire life, Hanna must decide whether it is more important to speak the truth or to protect oneself from shame.A powerful journey, “The Reader” asks us to examine our own relations to our countries, our loved ones and ourselves, and it points out that sometimes life’s most important relationships elude definition.You may like this book if…you like introspective novels, you are interested in post-war Germany and the Holocaust, you enjoy novels that are written in simple, yet powerful, language, you like novels that ask the question: ""what would you do in this situation?"", you are interested in courtroom drama and the Nuremberg trials, you want to understand the meaning of the title (it’s been perfectly selected), you enjoyed the Oscar-winning film adaptation from 2008, you like being emotionally overcome by your reading selections, you like nontraditional “love” stories, you have a dark sentimentality when it comes to the arts.You may not like this book if…you prefer not to read about something so emotionally raw as the Holocaust, you need the questions to be answered if they are going to be asked, you can’t get past the love affair between the boy and the woman."
5194,762923648,it was amazing,"I will promise you that there will be no spoilers but I will give you the structure of the main plot (whatever that means).I just finished reading this long overdue romantic/dramatic novel by Bernard Schlink. This is one of the first two books (the other one was Mysterious Benedict Society)I came to the bookstore a long time ago (probably four years ago) that I took note of and remembered it ever since so when I found this book in Booksale, a secondhand bookstore, just imagine my joy!The book is a love story between a fifteen year old boy and a thirty seven year old woman, that's how the story started. They fall in love (first part), they fall apart (second part) and they fall out of love (third part).It’s only two hundred pages long and it could have been finished in just three or four hours but I finished it in one week. (Reasons: TV series and university life) The first part was my favorite part of all ‘cause there is a ten percent probability that I’m a pervert. It was an erotic love story, indeed, as the summary at the end of the book says. The second part, years later of part one, which slowed me down gets a little philosophical and becomes a little bit of a crime novel but the good news was that it still remained a Bernard Schlink love story even if this part may seem like a scene from a crime novel. (Wait, he also write crime novels, right?) The third part is another years later and it is the best in the book. It’s a summary of the second part and a reminiscing of the first part. It includes what happened next to both of their lives and the last three chapters made me cry so damn hard.The book is very personal to me, I have no valid reasons why, but only because it touched me in some way. The edition that I bought had Kate Winslet on the cover which was fine by me but the thing that I really liked about the book is the font, the way the short chapters and parts made readers want more, the language of Schlink and the (hopefully) accurate translator and of course its emotional grounds.The movie adaptation will be reviewed (for the sake of writing something for this blog) on Saturday. I have it on my phone and watching it by parts, which could be not a good idea.Thanks for reading, I hope you’ll get your own copy soon. (Or you could borrow mine if you lived near Quezon City, Philippines)Further reading says the last page: Crime and Punishment. (Putting it in my reading list for next year)"

Michael is 15 year old and one day on his way to school he falls sick and is rescued by Hannah, a 36 year old street car conductor. What follows is a sensual encounter between the two and both continue a furtive courtship full of passion, intense love-making, vacations and romance. Michael becomes bewitched by Hana and falls in love with her but her silences perturbs him. She keeps mum about her past life and is hardly ever seen in public. She asks Michael to read to her and they spend much time with books- Michael reading her popular German classics. One day Hannah disappears without any trace or explanation. Life moves on and Michael joins law school. He is supposed to attend a trial as a part of his course, where he sees Hannah again. She is being tried for a hideous crime but it doesn't take Michael to realize that during the trial, through her obscure arguments having various loopholes, her momentary blank stares and her peculiar silence, she is trying to guard a secret- a secret about herself that she doesn't want anyone to know, which Michael is soon to find out.""The Reader"" is a hard-hitting tale of passion, love, guilt and a meditation on choices one makes in life. The story has mention of holocaust and it takes place in Post-war Germany and you might want to step in the shoes of someone who has been through the tragic era to actually understand Hannah's behavior and her secret. The book, towards the end, will also leave you wondering- wondering about who was right and who was wrong or if no one was right or wrong and it was just circumstances cunningly setting things the way they came out to be.

5194,1602569151,really liked it,"4.5/5 — A book of questions about humanity, not eroticism nor the HolocaustWhat is right, wrong? What is bad, good? I think that most people can answer those questions easily enough when the definitions are broad and abstract. It depends on their history, their worldview. In The Reader we are given complex circumstances in which to face those questions. Michael is in the thick of it, wrestling between emotion and rationality not only within his own mind but in his social world with Hanna and everyone else. And that's the way life really presents the ideas and subsequent decisions of morality, ethics, action and inaction, guilt, forgiveness, love, hate, indifference. Not as they are defined on paper in a classroom but when you're out on the street. To me, there was the contrast between Michael's relationships with his father and Hanna that illustrated such a difference. The cold philosopher versus the layered beloved. The decisions become harder for Michael, and us. No matter the torments of Michael or Hanna or the reader, there is always this evidence of answer, which I quote from the book:
The truth of what one says lies in what one does.
I haven't even mentioned the story of the book, which I just finished. To my mind, it is a good one. It must be, to leave me in such deep thought. Doesn't that speak to the strength of a story? That a reader immediately reflects on his qualities of belief, and not only his, but of humanity? I think so. I've asked many questions here. This is a book of questions. While telling his story, Michael asks an abundance of them. They are for himself, which is also to say that they are for the reader. Like us, Michael must settle his struggles for himself. But that might not be possible. Some things do not resolve, do not end. Perhaps a piece is missing or a fork in the road is too difficult a choice. Yet, we naturally desire to close things. This leaves us in peril. 
Now to escape involves not just running away, but arriving somewhere.
Getting there can take a lifetime, or a life. "
5194,866498556,it was amazing,"Beyond words.!!!A rare feat.!!!It doesn't happen daily that one comes across a book that doesn't let you even bite your nails. Out of my habit,I did bite my nails in the beginning,but as the story progressed,I decided to stop biting my nails since it was causing me distraction,however tiny it was. So you can see how much interested I was in the book..Throughout the book,I felt three themes as the prominent ones-love,shame and literacy(or reading).. Even though other themes like holocaust is there,these were the currents that guided the story. LOVE..There are all kinds of love in this world,but never the same love twice..How true does Fitzgerald sound.!!The love in this story,the love between Hanna and Michael,seems so strange and yet when we see its many dimensions,it doesn't appear so strange at all. The love story between two people so distant in their age and social position.. Age never has been a barrier in love.. Still..Michael's position in the story seems desperate.. He never outgrows his childhood fascination and tries to see Hanna in all the women who come into his life.. No matter how much he grow up,he still remains that 15-year old at his heart.. Shame..Shame is yet another factor which plays a big role in the story,along with guilt. Michael's shame makes him distant from others. His feeling of guilt never lets him be honest to anybody,not even to his wife. Hanna's feeling of shame(of being called an illiterate) brings her downfall,keeping her behind bars till her death. She decides to outgrow her sensitivities only at a later stage of her life,when Michael starts sending the tapes. Literacy..Reading.. ha.. we are back at my favorite spot.. How wonderful Hanna must have felt when an entire new universe was opened to her in Michael's voice.! It is contagious,the way she loved listening to books. It would have been fun,to have a reader like that.. The book is so good that it wouldn't let you do anything else till it is finished. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "
5194,173810222,liked it,"When I saw this book in a thrift store a week ago, in the hands of woman I barely knew, I said to myself that I will never get out of this store without it carefully tucked between my armpit. Luckily, the woman brought it down and I paid for it first thing when she left the store. Truly, good books will find you.The story revolves around Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German boy and his affair with a woman twice his age, Hannah. They made love every afternoon. Eventually, their afternoon ritual included reading books aloud. Michael read it to Hannah. Hannah’s a great listener. But one day, she left.. And everything followed after that. Michael Berg was left craving for her. Turned out Hanna has a secret past. And another secret, which she finds shameful.I found The Reader more than what I bargained for. It’s a thought provoking book with post World War II issues and moral conundrums to ponder in every page. The book gives us glimpse of what Germany looks like after the second World War, how coming to terms with the past and finding the way home are activities that resonate with Germans living in the aftermath of World War II and the reunification of Germany. I admire the depth of every character. Readers will be called to judge the actions of both characters, and by that I experienced the difficulty of letting “justice pour down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream” in a world in which both justice and righteousness have lost their deontological moorings.I recommend it for anyone who has ever felt the rain. I have to say that at first, I only read it for the sexual parts. I was there, craving alongside with Michael, but mind you, the book is more than that."
5194,63981529,did not like it,"THE READER has been billed as everything from a holocaust story to a love story. It has been touted as a “must read” and has appeared on the LA Times Book of the Year list, as well as being an Oprah selection. (Being selected by Oprah should have been a dead give-away…..I have yet to like anything she selects).At any rate, one would think that this story of the relationship (both emotional and sexual) between a fifteen year old boy and a 40 year old woman played out against the backdrop of the Holocaust would present a compelling read, but if these were your expectations then you, like I, would be sadly disappointed.The lovers don’t really share anything remotely related to love, Hannah is secretive and remote and as a couple the two protagonists are distant and unsympathetic (almost appearing as observers in their own lives rather that participants). The courtroom scenes are bland, and the final revelation of “Hannah’s secret” is an almost laughable “sin” when compared to the horrors of the concentration camps. This is one of those “what is it” stories. Is it supposed to be the story of a countries collective guilt, a coming of age tale, a crusade for literacy, or just the mundane tale of a basically self-absorbed, insensitive woman and an impressionable young boy? Whatever the author intended, all that comes across is a bland recitation of dates, times, facts and suppositions which fail to engage the reader.How Hollywood ever chose this monochromatic book as appropriate fodder for a movie is beyond me. Too bad there is no rating of less than one star for that is what this book deserves. "
5194,116300367,it was amazing,"Rarely does a book just ram into my heart and mind like The Reader did and then leave me feeling deeply satisfied with the whole experience. I've yet to see the movie but suspect it will not disappoint.Anyone who has seen the movie (probably more people than have read the book) will know the whole plot but I don't want to give it away. Easily half of the greatness of the book is the way the plot is revealed and I for one, did not see any of it coming. Each revelation caused me to catch my breath and marvel.The theme of guilt is strong and tough and hit me where I live because of my ancestry (German) and religious upbringing (Lutheran). Schlink creates a stew of desire, sin and lost dreams but the broth is guilt: personal, familial, societal and judicial. If that sounds daunting and heavy, it is; but the writing is so perfect and seems to soothe the reader, seems to indicate that it will be alright in the end. Until the end, when nothing is right.Michael Berg, a teen just recovering from a long illness, with hormones raging and longing for a closeness with his father that he will never have, tells the story from his viewpoint. He is a typical European postwar individual, growing up in a world with few ideals.Hannah is a mature woman with a hard, cynical veneer that barely hides all manner of conflicts as mysterious to Michael as they are to herself. Once they begin a relationship, they are locked together by forces that neither understand. In an admirable economy of words, Schlink takes us through the years, the twists and turns that seem to ruin Michael's life, until we see that the ruin is mankind's."
5194,1071740024,it was amazing,"Una historia tan conocida y que tuvo mucho reconocimiento siempre es difícil de reseñar. Pero trataré de explicarme mejor con esta novela, que me parece de lectura obligada.1958, Alemania. Michael Berg es un joven común de quince años, que un día regresando del colegio se siente mal. Se cruza con una mujer cerca al portal de una casa, y ella le ayuda mientras el joven ensucia la calle con vómito. Varios meses después, luego de pasar mucho tiempo en cama por hepatitis, Michael decide regresar a la casa de la mujer y agradecerle el gesto con un ramo de flores. Casi sin pensarlo, el chico empezará a pensar mucho en esta mujer, y a visitarla asiduamente. Entre él y Hanna, que tiene 36 años surgirá un romance, donde la condición es que Michael le lea poesía y grandes obras de la literatura universal antes del sexo. Luego de meses de visitas y lecturas, Hannah desaparece repentinamente.Puede parecer que van los tiros por otro lado, pero no es así. El Lector es un ejercicio de la memoria, del crecimiento, de la culpa y el perdón. Desde el punto de vista de un Michael adulto, nos va contando cómo fue su relación con Hannah y lo que sucedió después de que ella desapareciera de pronto de su vida. Es una novela corta que al menos en la edición de Anagrama tiene poco más de 180 páginas, pero logra con una prosa elegante y evocadora pincelar la relación 'prohibida' de un muchacho y una mujer adulta.

5194,54410337,it was amazing,"*******SPOILERS!!!****Early in the book it would appear that Michael has become involved in a ""Tea & Sympathy"" type relationship with Anna. In addition to the sexual activities, his times spent with her increasingly required that he read to her a broad and varied assortment of literature. He,as a 15 year old, became adept at hiding his liasons with this much older woman from everyone.Despite his feelings of love for her, there are many aspects of her behavior which puzzled him. After many months of this sexual relationship, she moved away without any explanation.As one continues through this book and his growth into maturity,it is quite apparent that Michael has erected a shell of coolness about himself. He appears aloof to others and finds difficulty in his personal relationships. At one point in this story he questions the reader whether it has been observed that he has never mentioned his mother throughout the book.Rather than describe a complete synopsis here,it is sufficient to state that much turmoil and horror develop as this novel continues. Schlink has done well with his character development of both Anna and Michael as the book progresses. He has evoked much analysis of the motives and actions of both main characters, which continue to remain open to many interpretations.I managed to view the DVD of ""The Reader"" upon conclusion of my reading. The movie captured this story very well, with minimal changes which were necessary to describe certain scenes in the book. "
5194,964842478,really liked it,"4.5/5La archiconocida novela de Schlink narra la historia de cómo un joven adolescente llamado Michael Berg se acaba enamorando de una mujer mucho mayor que él a raíz de un encuentro fortuito. O al menos eso es lo que nos cuenta la primera parte de la novela, un extravagante affaire nabokoviano repleto de sensualidad, anhelo e irreprimibles descubrimientos sexuales que a pesar de su carácter idílico, parece en todo momento condenado al fracaso. Una vez tras otra, la casualidad será el motor encargado de reunir a estos dos personajes a lo largo de sus vidas, pero el difuminado recuerdo amoroso de Michael y el horrible pasado de Hanna como trabajadora en un campo de concentración nazi conspirarán continuamente en su contra. Así, mientras un inocente Michael procura por todos los medios entender a cabalidad el interior de Hanna, sus oscuras inclinaciones, sus inquietantes motivos y las atrocidades posteriores que cometió, nosotros nos veremos inmersos en un instructivo proceso judicial donde se debaten interesantes cuestiones sobre derecho, memoria histórica y las responsabilidades que debemos asumir por nuestros actos; todo ello escrito con una admirable mezcla de pericia narrativa y emotividad estilística que resuena con fuerza durante toda la novela. Triste, desoladora, melancólica... pero también repleta de esperanza y cierto carácter redentor, 'El lector' ha sido una lectura memorable que atesoraré con mucho cariño."
5194,774606335,really liked it,"Eine ungewöhnliche Liebesgeschichte. Eine Liebesgeschichte, in der nie über Liebe gesprochen wird und weder Michael noch Hanna wissen, ob der andere überhaupt je Liebe für einen empfunden hat. Dennoch ist das leitende Motiv stets die Liebe, wenn auch in besonderer Form.Der Fünfzehnjährige fühlt sich zunächst einfach körperlich von der über 20 Jahre älteren Frau angezogen und teilt mit ihr wenige Monate etliche gemeinsame sinnliche Stunden, bis Hanna eines Tages spurlos verschwindet. Er soll sie erst durch einen Zufall sieben Jahre später bei einem Prozess wiedersehen, bei dem sie als ehemalige KZ-Wärterin auf der Anklagebank sitzt und er - inzwischen Jura-Student - als Beobachter zugegen sein wird. Auch danach wird Michael nie völlig Hanna aus seiner Gedankenwelt drängen können. Er und sie werden bis zum Schluss immer ein Teil des anderen bleiben, verbunden durch das Lesen von Büchern.Zwischen ihnen stehen viele unausgesprochene und unbeantwortete Fragen, aber vor allem die Vergangenheit Hannas. Michael befindet sich auf immerwährender Analyse seiner Gefühle, seines Verhaltens und versucht ebenso ihre Handlungen zu verstehen. Diese reflektierenden Gedanken und philosophischen Betrachtungsweisen wurden mir im zweiten Teil mancherorts zu viel und bremsten den bis dahin wunderbaren Lesefluss. Stattdessen söhnte ich mich durch das überaus gelungene Ende wieder mit dem Buch aus, da es passender nicht hätte sein können. "
5194,39763578,liked it,"I admit it. This book sat on my shelf a while, and was almost doomed to obscurity when I found out it had been chosen as one for the club by Oprah. But once I picked it up, I whizzed through it.At first, I wondered if the style of writing- distant, reserved- was a function of the translation from the original German. But in retrospect, I don't think so. The reserve that Michael and Hannah have through much of their relationship- the withholding of information from each other- and the somewhat clinical catharsis that Michael claims for writing the book, are well served by the coolness in language. This is not a novel of passion, though it does have passion in it, but a novel of exploration and examination. It is to the author's credit and to his translator Carol Brown Janeway, that the book reads so easily and so well.The story explores extremely difficult subjects, including the Holocaust. But it is also about coming to terms with guilt. And there are so many types of guilt and so many reactions explored in the pages.I imagine this was a book popular with bookclubs all over the place.PS My review of this book was published in our local paper on March 27,2009http://charleston.net/news/2009/mar/2..."
5194,1895769205,really liked it,"La película me gustó pero la razón por la que compré el libro es porque costaba 1€, no voy a mentir. De lo que había visto en el cine, ya sabía que algunos temas subyacentes de la novela me interesaban mucho y en el libro me da la sensación de que tienen más peso. Tanto en la película como en el libro me vi venir uno de los giros argumentales pero eso no hizo que la novela perdiera interés, de hecho quizá me hizo estar más intrigada por leer el desenlace. Pero lo verdaderamente interesante de este libro en mi opinión es el enfoque que da el autor al tema del nazismo. Creo que es muy valiente el punto de vista que ha tomado Schlink y ha sabido reflejar muy bien los sentimientos de una generación que no puede confiar ni en sus propios padres. No he estado de acuerdo con todo lo que pensaba el protagonista, pero me ha parecido fascinante leer acerca de una realidad de la que nunca se habla, al contrario del tema de la Segunda Guerra Mundial que está ya muy manido. Espero que esta reseña no haya sido muy críptica, he intentado expresar mis sentimientos sin hacer ningún tipo de spoiler.Reseña en el blog: http://loslibrosdeldesvan.blogspot.co..."
5194,2360649232,really liked it,"Cuando leo sobre la segunda guerra mundial, me gusta que las historias se enfoquen en los alemanes, porque sobre los judíos sin ánimos de ofender ya tenemos bastante.Siempre llega a mi mente una frase dicha en 
Capitán América: El primer vengador:
 aprovechando el hype ""Muchos olvidan que el primer país que invadieron los nazis, fue el suyo"". ¡Viva la cultura pop.Nunca había leído sobre los juicios sobre crímenes de guerra nazi, y quede impresionada en como la gente se justificaba de sus actos. Que estoy consiente de que muchos no tuvieron opción, pero ¿cuantos disfrutaron del sufrimiento ajeno y luego mintieron para salvar el pellejo?Por otro lado, la historia de amor me agradó bastante, también es algo distinto sobre lo que no había leído antes. Yo pienso que Michael más que enamorado estaba encandilado con Hanna, le ofrecia una puerta a algo desconocido y placentero para su persona. El final me cautivo y conmocionó a partes iguales, muy recomendado.P.D: Adoro los libros con libros dentro, en este caso referencias a la literatura alemana, la cual es bastante desconocida para mi.

5194,601877512,liked it,"3.5. I picked this up at World Book Night and was spurred to read it after seeing Didi's 4 star review. It's very well-written (and presumably well translated). Schlink's style verges on floral, foregrounding emotion without slipping into sheer nostalgia. Something I assumed early on (the ""deep secret"" of the blurb) turned out to be the big reveal, which dampened my enjoyment somewhat. Schlink is great at undercutting tension of plot point reveals in favour of the characters' emotions and actions that follow, which I liked. At times, though, it wound up feeling a tad predictable. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in fantastic use of metaphor and in raising ethical questions on a personal level. With a few reservations, it's a great, short read, and definitely one of those good books for the bookish. "

The truths they teach will be a guidance to me for as long as I live.Also I must add, this is not a 'war' story, but the second world war does play a great part of it.This is not a 'love' story, but love plays it's part like it does in each of our lifes.

It's a novel, at first, about attraction and desire, but then moves to a much deeper treatise on moral philosophy, conscience, and identity. I felt for Hanna, I really did. She was tragic, but realistically so - her life got caught up with circumstances and external events in a way that could happen to anyone. Can we pass judgement on her without taking into account her life and circumstances? I don't think I can. My anger lies with our narrator, The Reader himself. I wish he'd spoken up for her."

There is nothing wrong with the prose, just that it wasn't very interesting to me.The story is one I had not encountered before - post-war Germany beginning in the late 50s. The first person narrator does not think about the war as he has not experienced it. It is only until he gets a bit older that he must think about the holocaust.I think the author could have done so much more with his idea. The use of the first person shuts down a more fully explored characterization. The ending is emotional, to be sure, but we get to it too abruptly."

5194,1369352812,liked it,"There are a lot of complaints here about this book being dry, and the writing falling flat and distant. On my view, that is this exactly what makes this book work- think about all the distasteful, traumatic novels that are written about the subject of the Holocaust. I'm not saying that the subject itself is not traumatic, but the fact that some people take advantage of it in an attempt to mirror the suffering in order to make money is simply sick. Besides, there is usually no greater reflection inside them than the universally acknowledged truth that Nazis were horrible. Furthermore, the sparse tone in ""The Reader"" was supposed to mirror the ""numbness"" felt by Michael and people in general, the anesthetic effect that treated the War as an everyday subject, and spared our protagonist of feelings and of the questions that accompanied them. Yes, it was the questions that he was afraid of- just like Hanna, who didn't even know some questions could be asked. The numbness Hanna felt was a numbness of thought, which allowed her to live only in the present; never having planned a thing. That of course contrasts Michael's obsession for History, in the way that he is obsessed with Hanna, because his past and the German past were the same. But I'm getting off-topic here- I was talking about questions. When one doesn't question, one is prone to have the answers given to him. That was what allowed Nazism to happen. Numbness of thought. I think Adorno wrote something like this in ""Education after Auschwitz"", but I could be mistaken. Anyway, that's where the illiteracy plays a part- a metaphore for not being able to think. Reading and writing, active thinking, are able to surpress yhis, the book is trying to say. It's not just that, though- I suspect it's also about art, and the fact that art is a questioning force. A force of nature, and feeling. Movement. Indeed, the moment when Michael starts the reccording sessions is a very powerful one. He can't communicate. He's lost whatever he had when he was young, and he doesn't know how to feel anymore, so he feels through books. Books that allow him to be both distant and close to Hanna at the same time. Subjectively speaking, I think that Michael loved Hanna only because she was a blank to him, so he could fill her with whatever he wanted. And, then, she suddenly gained a past, which gave new meaning to his adolescent memories. What is the truth, who is Hanna, who is he... He loved, he loves her. Not quite her, though. But his ignorance on the First Part could be compared to her ignorance. And he is as ashamed of her as she is of being illiterate. I don't think the question of the book was whether Hanna was actually a bad person- as much as the last pages try to advocate for her and show us her side (another interesting aspect of the book- Parte 1: idealized Hanna; Part 2:demonized Hanna; Part 3: mature conclusions. Although further analysis would contradict this simple generalization), it is easy to distrust her good intentions. That is, however, for one to decide, that is one's opinion, and, to be honest, maybe it doesn't even have an answer. People aren't judged for what they are, they are judged- and convicted- for what they've done. Now, are we what we've done? Is Existentialism truly a Humanism? Or do we actually need tools in order to become ourselves? Who are we?Michael's observations were at times more poetic than the story itself- whenever he wonders off, it's to point out an aspect of everyone's lives that no one had noticed yet- basic principle for a good book. He speaks about the happy pasts spoiled by dark truths, even if things were happy and happened a long time ago. He speaks of Germans rebelling against their country as the same as them rebelling against their parents.He speaks of the abstract world his father lived in as if the window in his room was a painting. Those were the ones I heard. His conversation with his father, by the way, was one of the most believable dialogues I have ever read. When he realizes that his father has regretted his past, later. Not that he'd had a Nazi past. He was just... absent. And he thought of that, later, but he was acting as if he'd always been who he was in the present, or as if the past didn't matter, or as if it hurt too much to think of the past. And Michael understood. That was brilliant. Generally, it was a pretty good book. The tree stars rathing is merely based on personal taste and opinions- it disturbed me that, along with all the questions Berg was supposely asking himself, he did not once consider that Hanna had abused him. But I guess it's because he felt guilty of every single one of his actions as a teenager. On the other hand, that only happened because he blamed Hanna. It's true that the Daughter later on makes a remark on the subject, but the book could have gone a little further on the matter without having become another disgusting work designed to attract sadists. He could simply have written a chapter about it, and that would be it. Although I think the hypothesis seems to somewhat perpetually permeate ""The Reader"", and that was the effect Schlink was searching for; a subtle hint. Still, I was under the impression that it was on the outside, and Michael never really gave it a thought- he didn't even need to recognize anything, he'd just... give it a thought. Anyway, that is my opinion. Moreover- and more objectively-, while I appreciate the message and the metaphores, I don't think ""The Reader"" should rely solely on this. It's not that I think time will forget about this book- time never forgets, we have learned. But you see, he talks about a lot of things, but never really insists on them. He insists on the metaphores and messages, to make sure you get them right, and as a 21st century reader I find this medieval practice rather annoying. None of this is translating my feeling towards the book, however. It is possible I can't quite explain why I didn't think this book was tremendously special. The plot was interesting enough, but it wasn't as interesting as The New York Trilogy for instance. It was philosophical enough, but it didn't come anywhere close to Chekhov or J.D. Salinger. When I think about it, I see a house sustaining itself without walls or windows, I see a ground and beams emerging from the ground, and the beams are connected to other beams framing an empty roof. Not that I know what that means. Probably that there is too much visible structure in this book, now that I have a chance to actually understand my impression. Yeah, that's it. Three stars. Perhaps one day I'll read it again. "
5194,79332810,really liked it,"Is it bad that I really liked this book? From some of the other reviews, I should hate this book. I should think it's fluff or cheesy or banal or pointless or underdeveloped, but I enjoyed it! Okay, it's short, so there's maybe not as much character development as one might like (we never really learn much about Hanna, and come to think of it, we don't learn *much* about Michael, either), but I still thought it was enough of a story to keep me reading for hours at a time. For me, this was a forget-all-of-your-responsibilities-for-the-day book; not many of my chores or tasks have gotten done the past two days, but man, I tore through that book! (And again, yes, it's short, so it's easier to tear through, but whatever.)I enjoyed Michael's contemplations and ponderings about the war, the Holocaust, the camp guards' roles, the villagers' roles during the Holocaust, and the later generations' responsibilities to history. And I liked the story: yes, the 15-year-old boy getting it on with the 36-year-old woman is a little overdone, but at least it wasn't done poorly here; if the trial hadn't been included in most synopses of the book, I would have been surprised by it; I was surprised by the twist of Hanna's shortcoming that was revealed; and I was certainly surprised by the ending, and really liked the way it was handled over the last few chapters.I was actually on a five-star path with this until I read reviews of it about halfway through. Then I changed my thoughts to four stars because I obviously must be missing something. Darn all you people who trashed it! You made me doubt my enjoyment of it!"
5194,2410264640,it was amazing,"I have had this book on my shelf for far too long. I am glad to have finally got around to reading it. I remember when the book became a movie, my mother-in-law was watching it at my house while baby sitting our son. I ended up seeing the ending of the movie but at that time I was not reading and wasn't worried about spoilers. My impression of the book before I started reading was that it took place around World War II and involved a trial.After finishing part one of the book I was surprised that it was all about the relationship between Hanna and Michael, nothing about World War II. The age difference is prominent in the story; Michael is 15 and Hanna is stated as twice his age. Of course this is an inappropriate relationship but somehow in this story it works. As a reader I feel conflicted. “Imagine someone is racing intentionally towards his own destruction and you can save him – do you go ahead and save him?”Wow, part three of the book is gut wrenching. I had forgotten one of the main plot twits at the end and I was in tears. I thought this book was about many things; history, holocaust, coming-of-age but ultimately it was about relationships. At first very uncomfortable about the relationship between Hanna and Michael but by the end I thought is the most beautiful but complex relationship I have read about. I think this is one of those rare books that pack quite a punch in a mere 200 pages. I know this is a book and story that will stay with me for a long time. I am so looking forward to the movie as I love Kate Winslet and Ralph Fieness."

5194,446093722,it was amazing,"I read Bernhard Schlink’s ‘Homecoming’ last year and liked it very much. I have wanted to read other books by him since then, especially his more famous book ‘The Reader’. So when German Literature Month arrived this year I added ‘The Reader’ to my ‘Must read’ list. I finished reading it today. Here is what I think.I am not going to bore you with the plot outline of the story, as you have probably seen the movie version of ‘The Reader’ (for which Kate Winslet won an Oscar). What I would like to say after reading the book is this. The movie stays more or less faithful to the book with some minor liberties to the screenplay. When I read the book and the parts about Hanna, Kate Winslet’s face kept coming to my mind. That is one of the problems of seeing the movie version before reading the book. Which one is better – the movie or the book? I saw the movie a few years back when it came out and I can only talk about what I remember now about the impression the movie created on me at that time. With our memory being unreliable most times, I would take my own comparison with a pinch of salt. But if I stick my neck out and make the comparison, I would say that the movie and the book were good in different ways. The movie was good in terms of creating a visual picture of the story and saying things which cannot be said in words. The book is good with respect to the philosophical discussions which are explored through the narrator’s voice, which is difficult to do in a movie. The reasoning behind Hanna’s reluctance to reveal her secret is also better explained in the book. It also leaves many clues to the central mystery which I don’t remember the movie doing. The book also mentions many German books and writers – Intrigues and Love by Schiller, Schnitzler, Heller, Fontane, Heine Morike, Kafka, Frisch, Johnson, Bachmann, Lenz – one can make a ‘TBR’ list out of it  The things about Bernhard Schlink’s prose in ‘Homecoming’ that I liked very much were all there in ‘The Reader’ – the deceptively simple prose which hides the depth of the philosophical ideas and questions he addresses, the insightful observations on different things, the quotable quotes in every chapter. I thought that as I knew the story already, the book wouldn’t affect me that much. But inspite of that, the ending was still heartbreaking. Hanna is a beautiful, haunting heroine and I will never forget her. I wish things had turned out differently. If you have seen the movie version of ‘The Reader’, I don’t know whether I should recommend the book to you. It is good in its own right, but all the surprises have been revealed if you have already watched the movie. But if you haven’t watched the movie, then I would recommend that you read the book first and then watch the movie. I will leave you with some of my favourite passages from the book. Then I began to betray her. Not that I gave away any secrets or exposed Hanna. I didn’t reveal anything that I should have kept to myself. I kept something to myself that I should have revealed. I didn’t acknowledge her. I know that disavowal is an unusual form of betrayal. From the outside it is impossible to tell if you are disowning someone or simply exercising discretion, being considerate, avoiding embarrassments and sources of irritation. But you, who are doing the disowning, you know what you’re doing. And disavowal pulls the underpinnings away from a relationship just as surely as other more flamboyant types of betrayal. ‘I…I mean…so what would you have done?’ Hanna meant it as a serious question. She did not know what she should or could have done differently, and therefore wanted to hear from the judge, who seemed to know everything, what he would have done. Everything was quiet for a moment. It is not the custom at German trials for defendants to question the judges. But now the question had been asked, and everyone was waiting for the judge’s answer. He had to answer; he could not ignore the question or brush it away with a reprimand or a dismissive counterquestion. It was clear to everyone, it was clear to him too, and I understood why he had adopted an expression of irritation as his defining feature. It was his mask. Behind it, he could take a little time to find an answer. But not too long; the longer he took, the greater the tension and expectation, and the better his answer had to be.Now escape involves not just running away, but arriving somewhere. And the past I arrived in as a legal historian was no less alive than the present. It is also not true, as outsiders might assume, that one can merely observe the richness of life in the past, whereas one can participate in the present. Doing history means building bridges between the past and the present, observing both banks of the river, taking an active part on both sides.Have you read ‘The Reader’ by Bernhard Schlink? What do you think about it?"

5194,1876633917,it was ok," Anni Cinquanta. Storia di carne e ossessione fra Hanna e Michael. Lei ha 36 anni, lui 15. C’è un rito che precede il loro atto carnale: la lettura ad alta voce che il giovane è costretto a compiere prima di saziarsi di lei. È il “ragazzino”, il lettore di Hanna, colui che la risolleva dalla sua  vergogna segreta.Vergogna che la porta a cambiare lavoro ogni qualvolta si prospetta una promozione.Vergogna così grande che per sfuggirla lascia la Siemens dove lavora e si arruola nelle SS.Però…C’era un accordo tra gli industriali e le SS che, per far fronte alla crisi di personale, fornivano manodopera proveniente dai lager. Le industrie potevano contare su schiavi facilmente rimpiazzabili. La Siemens era una di queste.Peccato che Hanna non abbia mai incontrato uomini e donne e bambini in condizioni “precarie” che arrivavano dai campi di concentramento alla Siemens per lavorare. Sempre per la sua vergogna insopportabile, ad Auschwitz, farà leggere a voce alta un numero imprecisato di creature innocenti prima di mandarle a gasare.E per la stessa vergogna si assumerà persino l’unica colpa di cui non è responsabile.Poi il riscatto. La rimozione della vergogna: in carcere impara a leggere.Hanna era analfabeta.Può sembrare incredibile, ma in Germania negli anni ’20 l’analfabetismo era solo l’1-2% mentre in Italia si superava il 35%. E to’! Hanna faceva parte di quella percentuale. Un modo come un altro per rendere “umana” la carnefice, per alleggerire le responsabilità, per trasformare in peccato veniale colpe che non hanno pari. Al giudice chiede: “Che cosa avrebbe fatto lei?”. Giacché la sua è stata una scelta volontaria, perché porre questa domanda? Perché le risposte ci sono, e non comprendono l’arruolamento nelle SS. Una, per esempio: “Avrei cercato un altro impiego come le volte precedenti”.E c’è il silenzio di Michael quando, anni dopo, assiste per caso al processo. Lui sa, ha capito che lei è analfabeta. Potrebbe rivelarlo al giudice e farle ridurre la pena. Ma tace. Perché? Per rispettare il segreto di Hanna?  Per motivi personali? Per codardia? Per vergogna? La donna che si è amata, e che rimane nel cuore per tutta la vita non merita d’essere scagionata da una colpa orrenda di cui non è responsabile? Ma poi per buon cuore registra su nastro un buon numero di libri e glieli invia in carcere. “Al tempo stesso mi chiedo, e cominciai a chiedermelo già allora: ma cosa doveva e deve farsene, la mia generazione di nati dopo, delle informazioni sulle atrocità dello sterminio degli ebrei? Noi non dobbiamo pensare di poter comprendere ciò che è incomprensibile, non possiamo comparare ciò che è incomparabile, non possiamo indagare, perché chi indaga sulle atrocità, anche se non le mette in discussione, ne fa comunque oggetto di comunicazione e non ottiene che qualcosa di fronte a cui può solo ammutolire per l'orrore, la colpa e la vergogna. Dobbiamo solo ammutolire per l'orrore, la colpa e la vergogna? A quale scopo? No, non è che l'ardore della rielaborazione e lo zelo di far luce, con cui avevo partecipato al seminario, fossero andati perduti durante il dibattimento. Ma che solo pochi venissero condannati e puniti e che noi, la generazione venuta dopo, ci ritrovassimo ammutoliti dall'orrore, dalla colpa e dalla vergogna: era giusto che fosse così?” A quale scopo? Io dico: allo scopo di mantenere viva la memoria in modo che l’orrore non si compia nuovamente. E allo scopo di crescere nuove coscienze che traggano insegnamento dalla Storia.Se è vero che le colpe dei padri non devono ricadere sui figli (e per figli intendo la generazione dei venuti dopo) è altrettanto vero che i figli hanno l’obbligo morale di non reiterare le colpe dei padri. Questo vale per la Germania, come per l’Italia o qualunque altra nazione.Non ci si deve vergognare, ma indignare, sì. Bella scrittura, ma distaccata, fredda. La “Storia” sfiorata. Ci sono temi troppo importanti perché siano solo accennati e non scavati. Anche in un romanzo.Non si può rendere impalpabile la banalità del male."

5194,61693299,really liked it,"The Reader, by Bernhard Schlink, takes place in postwar Germany. Michael Berg's high school year is interrupted by hepititis. The last day he managed to stumble into school, he didn't make it home on his own. He'd thrown up on Banhofstrasse, where a brusque, determined woman cleaned him up, carried his school books, and walked him home.Months later, when Michael was well again, he bought flowers, returned to Banhofstrasse, introduced himself, and thanked this woman, as he was expected to do. That is how Michael comes to meet Hanna again. What follows is an affair between the 15-year-old Michael and the thirty-something Hanna, in which Hanna has the upper hand. An important part of their time together involves her insistence that Michael read to her, which he does, reluctantly at first, and then with enthusiasm. During this period, Michael is consumed with this affair, arranges his social life around it, spends time choosing books to read, and daydreams about Hanna. Then, one day, she is gone. She's quit her job and moved out of her apartment with warning. By this point, the reader (of this novel) is certainly wondering about Hanna: why is this attractive youngish woman so alone and why would she want sex with a 15-year-old boy? She must have a problem, this isn't normal, and in our culture, it would be a crime.Hanna is indeed hiding something, as Michael is to discover some years down the road, as a law student, when he witnesses a trial in which Hanna is one of the defendants. She is accused of a war crime from the days she spent as a prison guard, working for the SS. Is this why Hanna has moved from place to place, always alone? No, but that is what the jury is led to believe, and Hanna does not defend herself against the worst of accusations because she is still in hiding, unwilling to reveal a certain personal flaw. In fact, Hanna had chosen to work for the SS over another job to hide this secret, a choice I cannot understand and find repugnant and amoral. During this part of the novel, author Bernhard Schlink addresses the generation gap of postwar Germany.Parental expectations, from which every generation must free itself, were nullified by the fact that these parents had failed to measure up during the Third Reich or after it ended. How could those who had committed Nazi crimes or watched them happen or looked away while they were happening or tolerated the criminals among them after 1945 or even accepted them--how could they have anything to say to their children? Michael Berg has a unique perspective, for someone of his generation. After all, he has been in love with a former Nazi. His relationship with Hanna had already adversely affected his emotional life and relationships, but now, at the trial, he was suddenly facing moral issues, as well.At this point, he is no longer in love with Hanna, but he is again consumed with trying to understand her, and when one day he realizes what her secret is, he struggles with what he should do with this knowledge. Michael has always carried around guilt about Hanna, a feeling that he's somehow betrayed her, which I never completely understood. However, it is understandable, at this point in his life, that he would not want to turn his back on someone he had cared for. And so, in the end, Michael Berg does what he feels is right by Hanna and makes him feel most comfortable. I understand Michael's choices, but Hanna remains an enigma to me. I cannot understand the way she lived, and perhaps she is meant to represent a generation that feared certain types of exposure so much that they would fall in line and willingly do what most people would find unthinkable and horrible. I would add that Hanna's secret flaw could have been corrected, but instead, she seems to have developed a one-track mind for hiding it.At the same time, I do not enjoy having such unsympathetic feelings towards Hanna. It does make me feel uncomfortable to judge her that way. And, I suppose, that is the art of Bernhard Schlink. The Reader is just 218 pages, but it packs a wallop, exploring all the gray areas in moral questions, and is definitely worth the read. I am grateful this was made into a movie, since it reminded me to finally read this book! "

5194,1574279760,it was amazing,"I have this terrible habit of reading reviews thoroughly before fully diving into a book and then sort of forming my own opinion around those of others. . . In this way, as I read I seek for flaws that other readers found, not giving myself a chance I need. This has almost happened to The Reader as well, but somehow, this book has taken my heart and mind captive so powerfully that I could barely remember what others thought of it. . . This story has touched my heart powerfully. It is written in a peculiar, almost juristical style, which is nearly as curmudgeonly and at times incomprehensibly cold as Michael himself. He holds himself at distance: from the story, from Hanna and even from the reader. It is almost like the author is the cold, impersonal reader Michael, emotionless and distant. Nothing more than that. But even in this language, there is some sort of peculiar charm that draws you to the book, it's beautiful in an odd way, like the late fall. His narrative is not bulky at all. It does not paralyze your own thinking, but gives you space for your own analysis. For me that was an undoubted advantage.At the beginning I was rather apprehensive of the love story line between Michael and Hanna. You see, I don't tend to enjoy erotic things much, they scare me off. But surprisingly, their affair is written about beautifully, it's nothing vulgar or low-minded. In this narrative there is some purity, even, and almost pristine simplicity. I was personally very impressed by Hanna's tender admiring of Michael's intellectual achievement and the fact that someday he, just like his father, would also be writing books. This reveals her humble, strong nature. Despite her personal limitations, she is not envious or spiteful. There is something very soft, very compassionate about her, there is also a great yearning for knowledge. In spite of her own meager education level, she is intelligent and realizes the burthen of her guilt. She seeks redemption and is yet ready to bear responsibility, unlike Michael. Hanna is obedient to duty and never repines. In my eyes, Hanna is an example of an incredibly strong woman. She astounded me.For me, The Reader is a deeply philosophical novel, touching on many controversial subjects. It is not your stereotypical Holocaust novel, even though it is about Holocaust in every fiber. It is a novel about acceptance of the horrors of the past, about healing. It challenges us, encouraging us to ask ourselves a question that Hanna asked of the judge: What would YOU do if you were in my place? This is a novel of forgiveness, without which you can't move forward.I loved how the relationship with Hanna became a sort of make or break moment for Michael, as this affair allowed him to see the horrendous story of holocaust and concentration camps from a different angle, and therefore make a step toward reconciliation with the past of his nation and the world. It is a poignant, lively novel of that first step, bitter and painful, yet important.Schlink does not give you any direct answers, but instead provides you with rich food for thought."

Then I realized our story was slipping away from me and i wanted to recapture it by writing, but that didn't coax up the memories either. For the last few years I've left our story alone. I've made peace with it. And it came back, detail for detail and in such a fully rounded fashion, with it's own direction and it's own sense of completion, that is no longer makes me sad. What a sad story, I thought for so long. Not that I now think it was happy. BUT I THINK IT IS TRUE, AND THUS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IS IS SAD OR HAPPY HAS NO MEANING WHATEVER. ""Part 1:This is a love story- but not really. Micheal is 15 when we are introduced to him, that is also when he meets an older lady, in her 30's. He is sick, she helps. He goes to thank her and it becomes something way more than innocent. They pretty much start going at it right of the bat. He loves her. She in her own way loves him- but is always seemingly off somewhere in her own head. While it was hard to get past their age difference, the story itself was still charming. A part of me really didn't like Hannah, but our main character is so enthralled with her it's hard not to want her to be a part of his life.Part 2:Hannah Skips town. No goodbye. Michael beats himself up. He feels guilty. He's mad at her. He's mad at himself. He throws himself into school at a Univerity. He becomes hard, he is no longer the light-hearted lover-boy of previous years. He tries to feel nothing. Enter a trail his class is going to. Ennter subject on Trial= Hannah. He lies to himself, he say's he feels nothing.Part 3:She is convicted of some pretty terrible crimes. He hates himself for being able to love someone who could allow such things to happen. He feels guilty again. She remains in jail for 18 years. He somewhat lives, but is always compelled to keep somewhat in toch with her. (I really don't wan't to say much here, I don't want to give away the story.) Is what they had truely love? will it last all the years? Will he get over his guilt? Does she really love hm? Is she a bad person?""Does everyone feel this way? When I was Young, I was perpetually overconfident or insecure. Either I felt Completely useless, unattractive and worthless, or I was pretty much a sucess, and everything I did was bound to succeed. When I was confident, I could overcome the hardest challenges. But all it took was the smallest setback for me to be sure that I was utterly worthless. Regaining my self-confidence had nothing to do with success; every goal I set myself, every recognition I craved made anything I actually did seem paltry by comparison, and whether I experienced it as a failure or triumph was utterly dependent on my mood.""For most of us who are Reader's, this book will tug at your hearstrings. Like I said this is a love story- but not really- it is sooo much more than that. It is a hauntingly beuatiful tale of post war romance and selfworth.Sidenote: I cannot wait to see Kate winslet in this role. She is going to bring Hannah to life!"

5194,2160543625,it was amazing,"Я люблю читать книги и иногда смотреть по ним фильмы. Получить удовольствие и от первого, и от второго получается не всегда. «Чтец» принадлежит к счастливым исключениям. Основная тема автора Бернхардта Шлинка – это отношение «второго поколения» - детей тех, кто жил и работал во время расцвета фашизма – к позиции и действиям своих родителей. В конце 40-х в Германии 15-летний Микаэль влюбляется и переживает первые сексуальные опыты с женщиной значительно старше себя. Ханна хороша собой, уверенна, очаровательна, она нежно к нему относится и называет его «малыш». Она умело, сознательно и совершенно обворожительно вводит его в мир взрослых отношений. Она – бывшая надзирательница концлагеря, которая отправляла заключенных на смерть. Трагедия «второго поколения» - бесконечный конфликт между любовью к своим родителям, и непониманием и осуждением того, что они совершили – таком дилемма Микаэля. Эти отношения становятся для него своеобразной вершиной, на которую он пытается вернуться всю свою взрослую жизнь, но которая бесконечно ускользает от него. Книга о двух людях, для которых война продолжала оставаться реальностью. В 180 страницах волшебным образом Шлинк поместил и трогательную живую историю отношений, и рассуждения о природе нацизма, и о встрече с собой и с тем, что ты совершил, которую пережить невозможно.Для меня квинтэссенцией национализма, Ханны и «Чтеца» стала эта цитата: «Палач не исполняет приказы. Он делает свою работу – безо всякой ненависти к тем, кого казнят, без чувства мести, он убивает не потому, что они стоят у него на пути и чем-то ему угрожают. Он к ним абсолютно равнодушен. Настолько равнодушен что ему все равно – убивать их или нет.»#kyivbookworms #внеКЛАССноечтение #естьчтопочитать"

The affair startsoff awkwardly and grows passionately. Then one day, his lover, Hanna who was illogical, complicated yet real leaves him without any intimidation. Micheal, after she leaves feels that he had betrayed her somehow. Next time, they meet each other is at a trial where she is one of the defendants and Micheal being a law student.This book puts forward a lot of questions, question on ethics, moral and love. I love the flow of the story even though I felt that it was being dragged slightly in between. It is one of the books where you had no expectations whatsoever from it while starting and that would turn out to be a masterpiece. The picture of Nazi camps and sufferings of those involved in it are given so vividly and honestly. I don't really know how many books are out there that talk about feelings of those guards of the camps. The observations on how the future generations then would try to cope up with the history the previous generation left them with are quite important and accurate.This book is deep, quite disturbing yet beautifully written. It talks about complications of characters in a way that could be related to anyone who reads it.In an instance, Micheal decribles how Hanna thinks all the authors and stories she was being read to as contemporaries because she didn't know much about the history. I think this book should be treated as one because it acts as a metaphor.The book gets dull at places but I was asking myself how else how could it be, how else would you tell such a story! For I'm the one who started this book with zero expectations and slightly turned off with the back and forth erotism in the beginning, this book worked well for me in second and third parts. Overall it is a powerful story to be told."
5194,1578968335,really liked it,"Socrates worried that the latest technology--writing, reading--would corrupt minds because they would no longer be required to carry information in their heads since they could always refer to it in a book or from a library. Then there's The Reader.Sure, the premise of this novel concerns statutory rape, but Lolita concerns the same, plus kidnapping and murder and it it gets good reviews. This is my second time through this novel (and in the meantime, I read Lolita, a prerequisite to reading The Reader) and I respect Schlink's novel more in this reading.I respect it in its perspective; since the narrator is the victim, his perspective rises as a plea for clemency--for himself and his old-love. I respect it because he chronicles his inner psychological trauma and how he works out his grief. I respect it because I think (thanks, John Gardner) that all great fiction must have the moral dilemma, the ethical question as a key ingredient. Hanna Schmitz used young Michael Berg [German for mountain] as a sex toy. She used him as a means to ascend to the top of the mountain--something like a chairlift at a ski resort. Michael Berg used Hanna Schmitz as a sex toy. He used her for his own sexual gratification and romantic ideals--something like an Everywoman who could please him in his puerile lusts. The reading is what saves this novel. The fact that narrative unites these two desperate common people into one union redeems the novel and makes it worthy. You know, should have a twinge of blush when we read books like this too. It gratifies. Ahem! There is a whiff of voyeurism in each tale that we read; as spectators, we experience the pleasure via language. Hanna Schmitz serves as a despicable, power-crazed woman who volunteered for the SS in order to victimize others in her middle-management-authoritarian role as a prison guard. Meanwhile young Michael Berg suffers from his protracted role as the young stud, all the while learning how to satisfy her sexually. I guess I learned from this something that physicists already know about the molecular world: Like matter, exchanging heat but retaining molecular identity, humans exchange heat but retain the identity of memory, imagination, and the present. Here nothing gets lost in the translation."
5194,72647829,it was amazing,"At first glance The Reader tells the story of a 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a woman in her thirties and how it affects him for the rest of his life. That is only the outer layer of the story though: as soon as you look deeper you see that more than anything it is about Germany after WW2, about shame and guilt, right and wrong, struggling with finding an identity for a generation that is coming to terms with the past and picking up the pieces. And it's not just my or some critic's opinion, Mr. Schlink tells us as much himself when Michael ponders his generation and its heritage, and tries to understand the past. Another reason that leads me to believe that this book is less about the relationship of Michael and Hanna and more about the German society after the war is that at no time does Michael ask in the book how could Hanna do what she did to him but there's plenty of times when he talks about how could the Germans allow the atrocities to happen, how could they not stand up to it all, how could they accept the former fascists back into society. It is as if he is more scarred by that than by having his whole life ruined by and eventually, in a way, devoted to a woman who didn't seem to care about the consequences of her actions. One of the strongest features of this book is its elegantly spare, declarative prose. There are few explanations, just simple statements of facts that are offered to us without reservation. There are reflections on morality, humanity, right and wrong, and they too are so simple that they give the novel depth without rendering it unreadable. Yet as positively unflowery as the writing is the author manages to tell us exactly who his characters are, allows us to discover them gradually and without inflicting his own conclusions upon us, creates perfectly complete portraits with a few well-chosen words and well-placed sencentes. There is a lot of story in a book that is barely two hundred pages long and since we only get Michael's side of it by no means does Mr. Schlink tell us all there is to tell. There is plenty to think about and I hope that if you haven't read this book that you will add it to your to-read list. It is most definitely worth a day or a weekend of your time.

5194,549316891,it was amazing,"I think that “Der Vorleser” opens quite a new field, a new perspective, and because of its many levels offers so much to so different readers.Although revolving around Germany and war as its building blocks, this is not a novel about World War II. Nor is it about the Holocaust. Nor National Socialism. But it is about the confrontation of two generation, about perspective and about the many aspects of responsibility. Being all that, it is also a deeply personal story, but with its solipsism contributing greatly to a transition from individual to universal level. Starting off as a liaison between a teenage boy and a mature woman (a schoolboy’s dream not unlike Giuseppe Tornatore’s “Malena”), the story abruptly ends in order to be re-evaluated from a quite different angle. Thanks to the rich, emotional approach this account could easily make a short form of its own. But it is not even the beginning yet, and with a deep incision where the protagonist, now a young man in his twenties, and his former lover meet again under entirely different circumstances, the reader will have to go back to see some subtle details in a story of passion and tenderness as a foreshadow. The strength of the narrative lies in its first-person-focus: like the protagonist, the reader gradually comes to realize things that, at least afterwards, seem to have been so plain to see. In a language that I could only describe as “pure”, giving hints rather than illustrating, but doing so with utmost precision, and extending altogether through several decades, the rich plot emphasises the emotions of betrayal and loyalty, responsibility and guilt and remorse. A striking feature of this novel is how reflective it is, extending all sentiments through so many levels and layers: betrayal of a friend, betrayal of a lover, betrayal of the family (or loyalty as the mirror image of betrayal), responsibility for one’s own actions, responsibility for the generation of the fathers, responsibility for the truth, responsibility in the name of humanity and all the nuances and thin lines in between. With its intense storyline, this novel can be read as a thrilling account of events, but still there is so much more to it that the sujet itself cannot even begin to cover. I imagine that everyone who liked Julian Barnes’ “The Sense of an Ending” would enjoy this book as well. And the other way around."
5194,299273080,it was amazing,"So this is one of those novels that haunts you long after you put it down and it's surprising, for such a short and quick read. I'm giving this book 5 stars. And I'm going to guess this is much better than the movie although I've not seen it. I'll start in the beginning. The eroticism in the earlier chapters doesn't really linger in the readers mind after the author addresses the real issue, in fact, I think from both Hanna and Michael's as well as for the readers (us, I mean) it's merely a distraction. Following are the layers I looked at while reading this. In one layer, this is a bildungsroman, the physical/mental maturity of Michael Berg. As an adult he must come to terms with the past, the history of the Nazi crimes, so it's a story of the conflict of the the post-war generation in Germany. And I believe Hanna's character is a symbol to everything Michael feels about their past, feeling of betrayal, guilt and love; he cannot draw a line and say this is this or that. Then it's a great historical exploration, makes the readers (us) question whether the history we believe is completely correct? and perhaps there will be things that we will never learn (view spoiler)[ like how no-one other than two characters in the novel, never learned that Hanna never was the person in charge  (hide spoiler)] The novel gives you a different angle to look at Holocaust and it's refreshing. I find here at GRs there are quite a number of readers who seems to ""enjoy"" Holocaust Fiction, and I sometimes see some biased reviews. I think the book comes as a challenge to them as well, look at it from a different angle! ""We are not denying it but look closer."" At the same time it tells the readers and well the readers and the listeners in the story; that actions, no matter what the circumstances might have been, will have consequences. To sum up, Hanna is the gem in the tale in the end, I wonder, if she a person or a metaphor in a level I haven't understood. Her nakedness, her choices and actions literary and metaphorically contrasts heavily with her secret she hides. Does her nakedness question the ignorance? I was completely blown away by the story because the philosophical questions it raises are haunting. Recommended** "
5194,40067924,really liked it,"I started this on audio and picked it up in print. I realized after I finished that half of the riveting nature of the plot was the artfulness of the reader Campbell Scott. It must have been very difficult to pick a reader for ""The Reader"", but they did a fantastic job. When I picked the book back up in print with the idea that I'd be better able to pick up on nuance in plot and writing, I was disappointed. Frankly, the writing wasn't as good as I'd thought (though I rarely claim to be a good judge of that). This book is usually noted to be a novel of eroticism, but the narrator reads in an almost monotone that becomes intimate without any unnecessary inflection. I give the audio a lauded 5 stars and the text a disappointed 3 stars in comparison. An adult Michael Berg recollects the woman who set his life on its path. As a 15 year old boy who had become a bit of an introspective intellect in his confinement following Hepatitis, he met and was intrigued by 36 year old Hannah. The past and present blend as Michael and Hannah have a strange summer love affair in which the author artfully dances around propriety and eroticism. Hannah, with a mysterious past, is obviously troubled, and (like a car wreck in slow motion) we watch as she becomes the mysterious and troubled past for Michael. The love affair ends as oddly and abruptly as it began. So ends Part 1 of 3 of the book. In Part 2 we watch as Michael, now in Law School, is assigned to audit the trial in which Hannah is tried for a crime she is accused of committing as a Nazi guard of Auschwitz in WWII (20 years after the fact). I was surprised by how riveted I was by this part of the book. Legal proceedings almost always glaze my eyes over, but the author (who is a lawyer and judge) writes this, too, as if it were just another part of their love story. I won't give anything away here, though. Part 3 (where I picked up the text) takes place another 18 years later... just read it. Better yet, pick up or download the audio."
5194,849961218,liked it,"Non è un romanzo scritto bene, ve lo dico subito. Oppure è la traduzione che non rende giustizia al testo, non lo so, perché non conosco la lingua tedesca. Ma vivissima e intensa è la situazione che pone. Senza tanti fronzoli letterari, Bernhard Schlink ci porta dentro a diverse problematiche, che, a tutt’oggi, rimangono irrisolte. E lo fa con una voce che, a dispetto delle frequenti carenze espressive, suona vera. Non è certo il capolavoro che giustifichi il successo di vendita che ha avuto, ma è una storia che può valere la pena di ascoltare, per chi ne ha tempo e voglia.Immaginati un'operazione e un paziente che prende delle droghe incompatibili con l'anestesia, ma che si vergogna di essere un drogato e non vuol dirlo all'anestesista: parleresti con l'anestesista? Immaginati un processo e un imputato che sarà condannato, se non dichiara di essere mancino e in quanto tale non può aver commesso il delitto compiuto con la mano destra, ma che si vergogna di essere mancino: diresti al giudice come stanno le cose? Immaginati che sia un invertito e che non possa aver commesso il delitto in quanto invertito, ma si vergogni di esserlo. Non conta tanto il fatto che ci si vergogni di essere un mancino o un invertito: immaginati semplicemente che l'imputato si vergogna.«No, il tuo problema non ha una soluzione piacevole. Naturalmente bisogna agire, se la situazione da te descritta è una situazione di responsabilità più ampia o più coinvolgente. Quando si sa cosa sia bene per l'altro e si vede che lui chiude gli occhi di fronte a ciò, bisogna cercare di aprirglieli. Bisogna lasciargli sì l'ultima parola, ma bisogna parlare con lui: con lui, non alle sue spalle con qualcun altro»."

La imposibilidad de conectar o entender en su total plenitud las desgracias de nuestra historia; las responsabilidades que acarrearon las distintas generaciones alemanas tras el horror del Holocausto (desde los que no se sublevaron para sobrevivir durante la guerra, hasta los que no denunciaron que muchos de los implicados en la barbarie permanecieran en puestos privilegiados de la vida pública); y la irreversibilidad de los hechos que nos marcan en las edades tempranas, condicionando el resto de nuestra vida (así como las acciones y preferencias que irán naciendo en nosotros).Michael será incapaz de separar las sensaciones que le provocó su separación de Hanna con lo que debería sentir por los crímenes que cometió. Pero juzgando a su antiguo amor, se juzga a sí mismo, y a un país entero."
5194,53273753,it was ok,"When Michael Berg is 15, he has an affair with Hanna Schmitz, who is over twice his age. The affair does eventually come to an end, but their lives are intertwined afterwards.This book should have been passionate, challenging, and emotionally wrenching. But I just felt too distanced from everything. I’m trying to decide if this is because it’s told from Michael’s point of view and he’s a detached kind of guy, but mostly I don’t care. I see what it could have been versus what it is and I’m frustrated.I think the big conflict at the heart of the novel was supposed to be condemnation versus understanding and how hard it is, or even impossible, to feel both at the same time. I think I was supposed to question what I would have done in each character’s place, but I was too aggravated with Michael to have room for introspection. I was too busy wondering if the jackass was ever going to grow some balls and help Hanna out. (Sorry, Mama. But it’s true.) I wanted to smack him. He let her down in so many ways and somehow always found a way to make it her fault. Hanna wasn’t perfect either. In fact, they destroyed each other in round about ways, when they really could have been each other’s salvation. That may have been part of the point of the book also, but that’s not my kind of thing. I’m a die hard fan of the happy ending.Readers not requiring too much of an emotional attachment to their books will like this one. I think if I were that kind of reader I would definitely have enjoyed it more and been willing to think more about the conflicts it contains. But I’m not and so I’m left disliking it."
5194,44770676,really liked it,"What a haunting book. At first I didn't think I'd like this novel, fresh on the heels of my reading Zusak's lyrical, tightly constructed flow (The Book Thief). This novel has a lot more exposition, which suits its more philosophical purpose. I now have a reading hangover, because I started one night (couldn't sleep once I started it) and had to finish it the next (couldn't sleep until I finished it).Schlink poses difficult questions that tie into the plot, like what ultimately motivates a character, how does she tick? This is a good one for a book club, because it raises so many questions, and reading about a characters in the aftermath of Nazi Germany is something I hadn't yet encountered. Compelling, especially the ""what makes them tick"" part.Questions that go closer to personal experience, like why is it easier for people in relationships to act without verbally communicating why or what they're doing or intending, and what does their action ultimately mean? Can we ever know? Yet anyone who's ever been in a relationship has experienced these conundrums. My deep-seated urge to resolve these insolubles propelled me through the book and even calls for a second read. The author has a sense of keeping his reader at arm's length, engaging the reader to imagine and ask questions.Schlink effectively creates emotionally distant characters that nonetheless emotionally hooked me in, an art to pull off."
5194,100471138,it was amazing,"Michael Berg is a 15 year old German boy, who falls ill from hepatitis and literally collapses in front of Hanna Schmitz, a woman in her early 30s who tends to him and sends him home. Later she becomes his lover, and then she vanishes. Years later when he sees her next, Michael is a law student and she is on trial for war crimes. The Reader is an amazing work on so many levels - romantic, historic, psychological, philosophical, morality, even criminal justice, to name a few. The day I started reading this my aunt Harriet sent me an article she wrote about my Jewish great-grandmother having escaped Germany for America prior to the Holocaust, and about her family who perished in the camps. Harriet had an exchange student ""sister"" from Germany in highschool, and combined a visit to Grandma Sophie's birth home in 1975 with a reunion with her homestay sister. The two had a heated discussion about Harriet wanting to visit the concentration camps in Dachau, ""Ika begged her not to go (her generation had not caused World War II and didn't want to be blamed for or even reminded of it)."" For me, this book really gives the Holocaust scale. I can clearly see how subsequent generations have been affected. And as an illustration as to how power of the written word can affect someone! I'm so glad I read this before seeing the movie, loved this book, love that it's written by a German judge. "
5194,143903771,it was ok,"Typically, a book tells a story better than the movie from which it is made. In my opinion, the reverse is true of “The Reader”. Translated into English from German, I found the prose at times awkward and flat. Nonetheless, the story set in post war Germany of an unusual, erotic relationship between a teenage boy (Michael Berg) and a woman (Hanna Schmidt) twice his age made for compelling reading. Themes of love, passion, betrayal, guilt and shame were quite movingly explored. In between showering and love-making, Berg spent much time reading the classics to Frau Schmidt, who ravenously lapped them up. The poignancy of the act of reading hit home only when Schmidt was unable to defend herself when being tried for war crimes in Auschwitz. The strange “mother-kid” relationship left deeper imprints than Berg or Schmidt could ever anticipate. Berg’s capacity to establish relationships with other women was irrevocably stunted. The story seems to suggest that love has the power to save or destroy; in it hope resides, which renders adversity tolerable. Hanna needed it but Berg was perversely too self-absorbed. Additionally, the novel suggests that a person’s need to safeguard pride and dignity can be much stronger than life itself. Hanna kept her secret at great cost to herself. If you intend to read this novel, you will enjoy it much more if you do not first watch the movie."

Admittedly, it doesn't take much more time to read than to watch, and watching it is essentially the same as reading it. The Reader is one of those rare movies that doesn't lose its power in the process of transferral, but I suppose the book adds an extra layer of internal dialogue that is worth dipping into.Generally, I stay far away from WWII related anythings because they inspire a complicated range of emotion in me as a German. I don't really care to explain it; suffice it to say that I simply avoid it. The Reader isn't good or bad in that sense...it simply IS, raw and unadorned. The writing is sparse. The plot is disturbing. I'm giving it four stars because of its theme and its ability to move the audience without effort. Schlink isn't really trying to present something in a certain light, or to pass judgement, to inspire or agitate. The whole tone is matter-of-fact and somber, leaving the audience to its own devices and considerations. Its very simplicity is something that jumps up and down on the top of your frontal lobe, demanding attention. I really have no other way to describe it, and that description is likely vague and inadequate.Read it; The New York Times was right to name it a ""noteable"" book. Read it and make of it what you will. "
5194,55385522,really liked it,"I picked up The Reader to read about a young boy's affair with a Nazi-affiliated older woman.My expectations were simple: this would be a story of an idealistic minor, charmed by a deceptive woman, and what happens in the aftermath of his relationship when he sees her in a courtroom. Instead, I found it to be a story of a lonely woman, ashamed of her illiteracy, elegant in her cruel actions. The Reader is morally devastating. While there is no excuse for Hanna's actions regarding the war, there is also no redemption for our condemnation of her either. As we re-live the horrors of the Second World War, we realize how easy it is to be indifferent. Throughout the novel, as the protagonist - Michael Berg - transforms from a frail child to a cold, confused man, we recognize our own frailty and insensitivity. It's disturbing to see how we can identify with the perpetrators of the war in the same way we do with the victims of the war. I felt agitated, helpless, morally lost. The Reader is a short, simplistic read. But it's not easy. The vivid images Schlink creates are powerful in their impact. They slam against your consciousness - ideas, thoughts, feelings - with little relief. There is no answer, no guided road to a moral high ground. In the end, all we are left with is a sense of a broken, defeated life. "

5194,339213118,it was amazing,"This novel is a brilliantly interwoven and complex study of an intriguing concept : how did ordinary people like, Hannah, a teenage school leaver exist under the Nazi regime, find work and go about their everyday lives, and then how did these same Germans come to terms with thier consciences in post war Germany when the Allies intervened to impose a programme of 'Denazification'. Of course thousands of Germans denied culpability and denied sympathising with Nazi philosophies, let alone collaborating in implementing their policies and assisting in the machinery of death within the camps. Post war Germany is trying to move on but has to wrestle with the immediate and terrible past. In addition the novel is a 'coming of age' and 'rites of 'passage' story of a post war German teenager who is learning about the Nazi atrocities committed by his parents' generation, and their varying degrees of culpability in the name of the German Fuhrer. The young man, Michael Berg, finds it difficult to move on after his passionate first love and then experiences his own betrayal and faces his own conscience and discovering denial is a common human characteristic, easily condemned in others but difficult to acknowledge in oneself.

5194,318506792,liked it,"3.5 stars.Well, I don't know where to start. This book is short but heavy. Not heavy in terms of weight but heavy in terms of emotions that it carries. With a postwar Germany as its background, what did you expect? The book starts on a lighter note with a 15 year old boy who happens to meet a woman. And then there's no looking back.The book takes you on a journey so unique in itself that you find yourself pondering on it. I got confused a couple of times during the reading and had to re-read what it was about. The book is mysterious, I think I can call it that.The secrets spill out one by one and everything changes. I don't want to spill the premise or what happens afterward, so I'm at a loss of what to write.In all, this book made me think a lot. I don't think there's one answer to anything in this book. It will make you agree and disagree with your own thoughts. It will make you want to change things. It will make you emotional and you will speculate to no end.This will make a wonderful book for a book club. I wish I had someone to discuss it out loud with, this is one of that kind.I think I loved this one but then again, I'm not sure. LOL! I will have to re-read it sometime soon. I think I will watch the movie too."
5194,334152656,liked it," I like the book, the first few pages was weird. It is a story of a 15 year old boy, Michael Berg who had an affair with a woman twice his age, Hanna Schmitz. She works as a conductor of a street car and she has a mysterious background. She disappeared all of a sudden, without a word. They meet again on a trial where Michael is a law student while Hanna is on a trial for a crime. She was convicted for 18 years and Michael found out she was illiterate, her very own secret. It was hard for her to keep a secret that will make people put you down. She asks for people to read for her and tries to learn reading because of the cassettes containing stories that Michael recorded for her so she wouldn't be bored. She is a woman with a strong personality and determined to learn. She listens to the cassette while reading the same book so that she could follow it. At an old age, she learned how to write and read. Michael was proud of her, because of him she didn't stay illiterate.  There are some boring parts, but the essence was there's no obstacle in learning. Young or Old, we still learn things and do not be ashamed of your weakness. There's always a way to make your weakness turn to strong ones and boost your confidence.."
5194,1426501302,it was amazing,"Véritable coup de cœur pour ce roman. Bien qu'il traite des camps de concentration, il ne verse pas dans l'outrance descriptive, les détails sordides et ignobles que l'on ne connaît que trop bien de l'Holocauste nous sont ici épargnés (en général). Ce sujet terrible reste présent sans envahir, c'est fait avec une sobriété et une finesse hors du commun. J'ai été tourmentée, en même temps que le narrateur, par toutes ces questions philosophiques et morales liées à la responsabilité des actes nazis. On fait plus que de se poser l'éternelle question ""et nous, qu'aurait-on fait à leur place ?"", l'auteur nous guide bien plus loin en ajoutant une caractéristique bien singulière au personnage principal féminin, à cette gardienne de camp, qui rend la question encore plus insolvable.La première partie m'avait parue un peu longue, bien que joliment contée, mais elle s'avère être indispensable, c'est un socle parfait pour le cœur de l'histoire. J'ai pleuré, c'était inévitable ! Les deux personnages principaux, surtout la femme, conservent un mystère qui ne les rend que plus humains, plus proches de nous. C'est absolument magnifique, tout simplement, je le recommande très chaudement."

Lo que parece ser una novela de un romance tabú acaba siendo una muestra de que el pasado nos persigue y nunca nos dejará tranquilos. Como de el recuerdo del primer amor hasta la culpa por la muerte de otras personas. Es un hermoso libro.

So during reading many questions were risen.Sometimes I felt like I was struggling through really heavy writing, but the actual story itself and the moral questions that arise from its telling were really interesting and I surprised myself with how much I found myself contemplating this novel.Actually I like the book, and recommend it to all readers, who like deep meaning and thoughtful sentences."
5194,1777820083,it was amazing,"Watched the film years ago and cried my heart out. I remembered the details of the film as it is still one of my favourite. Therefore, when I found out that it was adapted from a book, I searched for it.As I was already bias for having an idea on the content of the book before I read it, I recognize the characters thoroughly well. I could connect more with Michael as I watched the movie when I was younger, and now I understand the poor cruel reality of Hanna's life. Confessing to cry more than once would not be exaggerating for me. The shame, embarassment, pride and shackle, it ached my heart to read on how Hanna couldn't be saved from the injustice because of her dignity. And the fact she took her own life, it pained me greatly.For the writing, it is easy to read and not weighed down by adjectives or too much description. It punctuated perfectly, simply precise. I would categorized it as a masculine narration. And it isn't dry. It finishes off like a glass of red wine at the end of exhausting, emotional rollercoaster day."
5194,28107827,liked it,"I still don't know what to think about this book. The writing style is dry and flat, but I never stopped squirming throughout. I didn't just not like it - I actively disliked reading it. It's painful. But I think that is the point. The author intends to make the reader squirm as he demonstrates that morality is an illusion and that even what appears to be pure evil is incredibly complex and multidimensional. Perpetrators are victims, and victims are perpetrators. One thing's for sure: It's not a comfortable version of reality. Eesh.The prose is flat and emotionless, but it still left me with an ambivalence so intense I am still trying to work out whether this book is horrible or amazing. Let's just say: This was not a fun read. I'm still trying to shake off the angst. It would be easy to say, because I didn't enjoy it, that it's not ""good."" But actually, I think it might be very good. I'm not really sure. Let me know if you figure it out!"
5194,332330548,liked it,"This is a potentially potent and mildly moving novel. There is an aura of something profound in it, something lying in the subtext, but I can't figure out what it is. And I cautiously suspect that it's not actually there. Being a thoroughly introspective novel, there is not much subtext. Everything resides in the words of the book, little in the spaces between; it neither beckons nor warrants speculation. It's a problem of the intensely intellectual first-person narrator. The Reader's reader reads every thought that can be thought by the narrator, so what thought is left for the thinking reader to think for herself?What The Reader graciously provides is a unique insight into a generation much ignored - the children of World War II-era Germans. How does one philosophically bear to live in a country responsible for the Holocaust? How do they absolve themselves of a crime they did not commit, yet feel guilt for nonetheless? "
5194,116242660,liked it," I'm not sure how I felt about this book as a whole. I loved part one. I was really into the love story and the pages flew by. Then I got to part two in the court and I kinda lost intrest. I think I seprated Hanna into two people. This teenage boys fantasy and the war criminal. Hanna the war criminal I felt nothing for, I didn't care if she went to jail or she didn't. The secret she keeps is stupid. I must admit I didn't pick up on it. I would be more intrested to know more about how the younger Germans dealt with the guilt of what their parents had done. I think the book picked up again in part three with the tapes and the sad ending. I had started to warm to her again by the end of the book even tho she didn't really deserve it. I do want to see the film now. I didn't get it for christmas :( "
5194,1653239129,really liked it,"Originally posted on the Little Miss Nowhere blog.Rather than a review, this is taken from a blog post I wrote that compared the reception of the book in Germany and overseas.""The Reader"" was written by the German author Bernhard Schlink and published in 1995. The novel was internationally acclaimed and has been adapted into a movie starring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes.While discussing the novel in class, my German teacher brought up an interesting point: the reaction and attention that the novel garnered in Germany was very different compared to those in America. This lead to me wondering why, and beginning to research for this blog post.Around 500.000 copies were sold in Germany, 200.000 in France, 100.000 in Great Britain and 750.000 in the USA. Worldwide, over a million copies have been sold and the novel has been published in over 25 languages.A profile of Bernhard Schlink, the author of the novel, that was written by Nicholas Wroe and published in ""The Guardian"" in 2002, presents the novel as reminiscent of the ""Third Reich's moral illiteracy"" and as incomparable with other novels published at the time.Although the novel has enjoyed remarkable success in the English-speaking world and become a ""set text on school and university syllabuses internationally"", it has been heavily criticised by others, such as the writer Frederick Raphael, who found the use of Hanna's illiteracy as an excuse for her crimes to be particularly problematic.Nicholas Wroe also presents Professor Frank Finley of Leeds University's dilemma in dealing with the novel due to the ""problematic use of literacy"" in it.The author states that people who have committed war crimes are now being depicted as normal people, and not evil people with no moral compass. While taking a ""more subtle approach to perpetrators"", The Reader is supposedly ""more critical of Schlink's own generation"". In order to highlight Schlink's opinion on the matter, Wroe quotes the author: ""'There is the problem of loving and admiring these people yet knowing what they have done'"".Schlink himself has announced that The Reader does not deal with the Holocaust, but instead focuses on how the second generation came to terms with their parents' crimes or actions during the war. After being criticised for having written what many thought to be an autobiographical novel, Schlink commented that ""[w]e can only write what we know[...]"". He also brought up an interesting point: According to him, the older generation was less likely to criticise the book than younger people.I'd like to compare two reviews found in the German newspaper ""Die Welt"" and the American ""New York Times"" respectively.Suzanne Ruta, the author of a review of ""The Reader""published in 1997, uses the words ""star-crossed lovers"" to describe Michael and Hanna during their time together. Hanna Schmitz, at least according to Ruta, is Michael's ""great love"". Yet the authors of the German review, David Deißner and Thomas Lindemann, explain that their love only causes the couple to feel loaded with guilt.""He who understands, does not judge. He who judges, does not understand"". The German authors state that it is this principle that leads to the great narrative energy that can be found in The Reader. This relation between the inability to comprehend and the haste with which some can surmise can also be witnessed in Ruta's review, in which she presents one of the questions that was asked by many after the war ended: ""'What did you do in the war, Daddy?'"". ""What's so lucky about loving your suspect parents and losing your humanity[...]?"", she asks, and brings up an important point: how can you begin to trust someone who you know has committed terrible crimes in their past?The German review goes even further to say that the novel is trying to expose the prejudiced and judgemental reader themselves. It does not simply, according to Deißner and Lindemann, attempt to find an ultimate solution to the problem by utilising Hanna's illiteracy, but to reveal the reader's own method when it comes to discernment of right and wrong.Ruta likens the novel to a ""fairy tale, minus the happy ending"", while the German review states that it is written in an almost cold manner, with absolutely no kitsch to be detected.Finally, Ruta deems the novel to be ""moving, suggestive and ultimately hopeful"", although she feels that the language is flat at times. Deißner and Lindemann, however, decide that the writing is its strong point, praising the author highly, while criticising the book's focus on the criminal, Hanna, stating that there is not enough austerity when dealing with such topics as this.A look at two additional reviews can specify the focal points that reviewers have chosen. Michael Stolleis wrote in the newspaper ""Frankfurter Allgemeine"" in 1995 that The Reader was an ""idealistic developmental novel, a process of consciental realisation and maturity, the acceptance of someone's fault through their own death"". Schlink's usage of language highlights this and reveals the author's own self-criticism. Stolleis declares The Reader to be Schlink's most personal book thus far.Andrea Cally of the Goethe-Institut also shares this opinion in her review. She describes Hanna as wary, keeping both Michael ""and by extension the reader, at arms length (sic)"". She lays emphasis on the fact that the story ""mirrors the fate of many German people [...] during the Nazi era"" and, similarly to Deißner and Lindemann, believes that Schlink also aimed to invite the reader to share the pain of the accused. She thinks that the novel analyses the Holocaust from every possible angle and that it attempts to underline the importance of empathy and forgiveness on the path to the future.Furthermore, Stolleis questions whether the novel is typical of its generation in its depiction of Michael as a young man who became interested in the Nazi movement. In his opinion, the plot becomes round and complete towards the end despite the conflicting messages that it may convey.To sum up, one can surmise that there are a great many similarities shared by the different reviews, regardless of which language they were written in. The German reviews, however, seem to lay more focus on praising the style of the author's writing, while the English reviews either criticise it or don't mention it at all. This can also be seen as a by-product of the English reviewers having read the book as a translation, and not the original. Additionally, the reviews written in English seem to take a more idealistic and hopeful take on the novel. The German reviewers are careful with such statements and prefer to lay emphasis on the maturity of the novel and the importance of the subject it portrays.One point that definitely struck a note with me was Deißner and Lindemann's criticism of the romantic take on the Holocaust that has been able to be observed in recent years. They reject the idea of a ""soundtrack to mass murder"", mentioning the award-winning 2004 film ""Downfall"". In my opinion, it would not be acceptable to present the events of the Second World War and the Nazi regime in a positive light. At the same time, movies and novels such as ""The Reader""and ""Downfall"" may incentivise people who may not have heard about the Holocaust or taken much interest in it at school to learn more about these terrible events.Thus I believe that media can help to raise awareness of concrete issues that must be tackled, especially in regards to the rising interest in radicalised views that can be observed today. Though the stories they portray may not always be completely accurate, if they can infuse people with enough enthusiasm to study about yesterday's mistakes, it may allow them to prevent similar circumstances in the future."
5194,146792303,it was amazing,"Read in a matter of minutes; not a book I would usually consider reading, rather a book I felt I should read. I'm glad I did, it was wonderful; beautifully written, absolutely heart breaking.I do not feel the ""immoral"" relationship that takes place (which puts a lot of people off reading) is a shocking one, nor are any of the scenes - of which none are explicit - perverse. I actually feel - despite Hanna and Michael's age difference - the choice was as much his as it was hers and therefore, such as in 'Lolita' by Vladimir Nabokov, this was more about the actual relationship than a moral debate to be raged over. More-so the story was about them and their love than it was ever about an illicit companionship.I felt sympathy for both Hanna and Michael for differing reasons; my heart ached for them both."
5194,1150399672,liked it,"I bought this book 3 years ago at a book sale. The cover intrigued me and I didn't know what the story was about. Last weekend I had the pleasure of taking a ride with The Reader and experiencing such emotional and philosophical turmoil, I almost had half the mind to stop reading it altogether! The story starts out slow and before long you're wondering if what Michel Berg does is right? And then he explores his sound of mind and what he should be feeling in regards for Hanna's actions.I can't say I loved this book and it moved me much, but there are many hidden nooks that a reader such as ourselves can discover buried truths in. I understand how this became a movie and the trailer looked really appealing. I sort of liked the style of writing but maybe I'm just not into that deep kind of reading? "

L’incontro è del tutto casuale –il protagonista è colto da un malore e viene soccorso dalla donna- e, se il passaggio successivo è ovvio (Michael, rimessosi, si reca da lei per ringraziarla), non lo è altrettanto il successivo: Michael sente, e non a torto, che la donna prova interesse sessuale nei suoi confronti. http://ghettodeilettori.blogspot.com/..."

5194,634560765,really liked it,"This was a very difficult book to rate. I read it after watching the movie and, in this case, I think that was a mistake. I thought the film surpassed the book in bringing out the moral ambiguity of the story.The Reader is about 15-year-old Michael Berg, who has an affair with Hanna, a woman more than twice his age. One day she disappears, and he expects to never see her again. Years later, he runs into her at a trial where she is accused of a Nazi crime. Michael must then wrestle with the implications of their relationship and whether he owes her anything. This book is a classic that does deserve credit. The questions it raises regarding morality and accountability leave a deep and long lasting impression. "
5194,59539743,it was amazing,"In the beginning, I despised Hanna then, I was mad at her. In the middle, I despised the main character, then I was mad at him. In the end I hated both of them yet could not stop myself from forgeving and pittying them.I never read a novel about people so out of touch with their feelings yet their feelings are all there is for the reader.Could degnity lead one to confess to what would lead him to life imprisonment? How could the movie capture all of those feelings? How could it capture the one thing that kept him so attatched to Hanna for more than thirty years; her smell?!!Okay Abdullah, tell me about the movie."
5194,74327477,really liked it,"This book proved to be a very interesting read about the Holocaust. It did not deny the evil that was done, but instead concentrated on issues of guilt and culpability. It starts out as love affair of a young man and an older woman and then changes direction when facts are revealed about the woman. The novel it is written in the first person and we see the world through the eyes of the young man. I was of the impression that the way he narrates the story that he had some insight into his life, but like many of us, there were areas that he found difficult to analyse. The style balances an efficient prose with genuine character development. All in all a thought provoking read."
5194,440705428,really liked it,Hanna's question 'What would you have done?' sounds interesting.Who should be guilty? German people who were used (by Hitler)to kill Jews ? How about who didn't kill but kept silence about Genocide ? And how about generals who ordered to kill Jews? Are these unanswerable questions? But I won't agree that being illiterate is an excuse for what she had done.And I am disappointed at Michael who is guilty for having a relationship with Hanna.He shouldn't be.Hanna loves him and he loves Hanna.That's all.
5194,1302315297,did not like it,"I had a detailed review, but my computer froze, so now you get a list).Eh. I didn't feel it. Why?1) The writing.It was dry and self-important. Two very big no-nos.2) The plot.The main point kept seeming to change.3) The characters. Allow me to break this up a lil' more comprehensively.A. Michael went through no emotional growth in the span of over twenty yearsB. Michael was iceberg material, hardly did he show any warmth, which is ironic as throughout the novel he continuously claims that Hanna is detached, when in fact the both are."

5194,339001614,it was amazing,"""The Reader"" was a compelling and fast read wherein the story of a powerful, illicit, and secret first love intersects with one of the darkest chapters of history--the aftermath of WWII in Germany. I enjoyed Schlink's clear and direct prose style. He raises some important moral, social, and philosophical questions that resonated for this reader long after I finished the novel, but he never does it in a way that is overbearing or detracts from the story. "
5194,50679071,it was amazing,I will be interested to see how the movie of this book was made. The book is very thought-provoking; there are no easy answers. What shapes a life? This book explores how is it we do not see/are unable to anticipate these things as they are happening and what consequences they will have. The author did a very good job concealing his hand and the allowing the outcomes to unfold and blindside me: I only anticipated one of the key mysteries.

And although it does not have a happy ending, it does have a closed ending. And it still is a really good ending.So, go and read this book!"
5194,1511536378,it was ok,"Cartea lui Bernhard Schlink a fost o lectură scurtă și plăcută, dar oarecum prea transparentă, monotonă. Aș fi vrut mai multă implicare afectivă a personajelor, poate un narator mai atent la detalii, exceptându-le pe cele olfactive care se pare că joacă rolul micilor sale pasiuni erotice. Imprevizibilul tinde să apară în deznodământ, dar reacția letargică a personajului principal îl anulează. Pot spune că ”Cititorul” este manuscrisul trunchiat al unui roman bun."

5194,1673034206,really liked it,Campbell Scott did a fine job narrating this. I did encounter one small glitch at the junction of the first two parts of the digital download from the library -- I don't know if it was just a problem with my individual download or intrinsic to the recording but several sentences were skipped. Luckily I had the paperback so I could just read them!
5194,188193545,it was amazing,"A beautiful, well-written, disturbing and morally devastating novel.It kept my attention all the way through its pages. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for everyone!I have to say that it is one of the best books I have ever read... and I read a lot! :)Read it! You won't regret it! "
5194,52141636,it was ok,"I read this book after having seen the movie, and I have to say that I prefer the movie, which rarely happens for me. I think it may be that there was something quite literally lost in translation from the German to the English. I found the writing style awkward and pedantic, but it was also punctuated by phraseology so dense I had to read it multiple times to grasp the author's meaning."
5194,1584893173,really liked it,"Well it is a good book. Going from Greman to English might not of done the trick. I feel that some parts could of been written part, more detail. I had o stop and think what he was trying to get across to me. I feel that if he put a little more into it. It would of been out of this world. And ""the kid"" was still in love with Hanna it the end, but in couldnt let himself see it till it was to late."
5194,1269743738,really liked it,As someone who has read and written from a very early age I cannot imagine illiteracy. This is an unknown country. This is the basic fact at the heart of Schlink's novel. Hanna Schmitz would rather endure a life sentence than admit to being illiterate. This is the tragedy at the heart of the novel and the basis of the narrator's relationship with Hanna. 
5194,134627793,really liked it,"I didn't know whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. I loved it either way for it's dark undercurrent and it's sadness, all of which was made easy for the reader to understand. A novel of many depths, a love story, and a story of humanity. I'm not going to tell you the whys or the reasons you need to read the book to understand. "
5194,61638640,liked it,"This has been on my bookshelf forever and who knows why I picked it up finally. I think the story fell flat for me because I had broken my ""Always Read the Book First"" rule and had seen the movie. It is beautifully written for sure and the story is interesting, but I didn't love the book. So there. "
5194,521386302,liked it,"A cerebral narrative, where the intensity of feeling is conveyed in an almost disturbingly detached manner by the narrator.I don't know if it's the fault of the typically German verb tenses. Even when translated into English, the protagonist kept his distance from his reminiscences, from his his moral dilemma. "
5194,53959195,liked it,"This lady who sells books gave me a copy of this yesterday and it's a super fast and mostly good read . . . the lady said she hated it and it was one of the stupidest books she's ever read, which, I don't know, I didn't feel that way. But now I want to read reviews to see what the hell, coz I thought it was fine--not the best thing I've ever read, but not the worst."
5194,446229921,liked it,"Book is good, but movie was better.Inspite of its intriguing plot book lacks FOCUS. Unnecessary chunks of philosophy here and there which would take you out of narrative, Irrelevant. Answers for the questions which you never asked, out of subject. Too many confused feelings of the narrator which never gets explained. Somehow book was not as emotionally stirring as the movie. "
5194,1159305356,it was amazing,"I read the reviews before I went in and most agree with how brief and simple this story is. The Reader speaks volume from this subtly.I adored this book. Might even go to my favourites shelf.A truly different holocaust story that needed to be told (and read). I am glad I finally got around to it, even if I am late.Highly recommended literature. BIG 5 stars!"
6288,19226230,did not like it,"The Road is unsteady and repetitive--now aping Melville, now Hemingway--but it is less a seamless blend than a reanimated corpse: sewn together from dead parts into a lumbering, incongruous whole, then jolted to ignoble half-life by McCarthy’s grand reputation with Hollywood Filmmakers and incestuous award committees.In '96, NYU Professor Alan Sokal submitted a paper for publication to several scientific journals. He made it so complex and full of jargon the average person wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of it. He wrote a conclusion that would deliberately flatter the preconceptions of the journals he submitted it to. As he predicted, it was accepted and published, despite the fact that it was all complete nonsense.The Sokal Affair showed the utter incompetence of these trusted judges. They were unable to recognize good (or bad) arguments and were mostly motivated by politics. The accolades showered upon works like The Road have convinced me that the judges of literature are just as incompetent (and I’m not the only one who thinks so). Unlike Sokol, McCarthy didn't do it purposefully, he just writes in an ostentatiously empty style which is safe and convenient to praise.Many have lauded his straightforward prose, and though I am not the most devoted fan of Hemingway, I can admire the precision and economy of a deliberate, economical use of words. Yet that was not what I got from The Road:
""He took out the plastic bottle of water and unscrewed the cap and held it out and the boy came and took it and stood drinking. He lowered the bottle and got his breath and he sat in the road and crossed his legs and drank again. Then he handed the bottle back and the man drank and screwed the cap back on and rummaged through the pack. The ate a can of white beans, passing it between them, and he threw the empty tin into the woods.Then they set out down the road again.""
Simple? Yes. Precise and purposeful? Hrdlt. The Road is as elegant as a laundry list (if not as well punctuated). Compiling a long and redundant series of unnecessary descriptions is not straightforward, but needlessly complicated.We're supposed to find this simplicity profound--that old postmodern game of defamiliarization, making the old seem new, showing the importance of everyday events--but McCarthy isn't actually changing the context, he's just restating. There is no personality in it, no relationship to the plot, no revealing of the characters. Perhaps it is meant to show their weariness: they cannot even muster enough energy to participate in their own lives, but is the best way to demonstrate boredom to write paragraphs that bore the reader? A good writer can make the mundane seem remarkable, but The Road is too bare to be beautiful, and too pointless to be poignant.Once we have been lulled by long redundancy, McCarthy abruptly switches gears, moving from the plainness of Hemingway to the florid, overwrought figurative language of Melville:
""The man thought he seemed some sad and solitary changeling child announcing the arrival of a traveling spectacle in shire and village who does not know that behind him the players have all been carried off by wolves.""
There is no attempt to bridge the two styles, they are forced to cohabitate, without rhyme or reason to unite them. In another sentence he describes 'dead ivy', 'dead grass' and 'dead trees' with unerring monotony, and then as if adding a punchline, declares them 'shrouded in a carbon fog'--which sounds like the world's blandest cyberpunk anthology.Another example:
""It's snowing, the boy said. A single gray flake sifting down. He caught it in his hand and watched it expire like the last host of christendom.""
McCarthy seems to be trying to reproduce the morbid religious symbolism of Melville when he plays the tattered prophet in Moby Dick. But while Melville's theology is terribly sublime and pervasive, McCarthy's is ostentatious and diminutive, like a carved molding in an otherwise unadorned room. Nowhere does he produce the staggeringly surreal otherworldliness Melville achieves in a line like ""There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within"".Often, McCarthy's gilded metaphors are piled, one atop the other, in what must be an attempt to develop an original voice, but which usually sounds more like the contents of a ‘Team Edward’ notebook, left behind after poetry class:
"". . . Query: How does the never to be differ from what never was?Dark of the invisible moon. The nights now only slightly less black. By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.People sitting on the sidewalk in the dawn half immolate and smoking in their clothes. Like failed sectarian suicides. . . .""
I love how he prefaces that like an Asimov robot. Sardonic Observation: I'd almost believe he was one, since he has no understanding of beauty or human emotion. Biting Quip: However, he violates Asimov's first law, since his awkward prose harms human ears.Sometimes, smack in the middle of a detailed description of scraping paint with a screwdriver, we suddenly get a complex jargon term which few readers would understand. These terms are neither part of the world, nor are they aspects of specialized character knowledge, so I cannot assign them any meaning in the text.One of the basic lessons for any beginning writer is 'don't just add big words because you can', it's self-indulgent and doesn't really help the story. It would be one thing if it were a part of some stylistic structure instead of bits of out-of-place jargon that conflict with the overall style of the book--more textual flotsam for us to wade through.The longer I read, the more mirthlessly dire it became, and the less I found I could take it seriously. Every little cluster of sentences left on its own as a standalone chapter, every little two-word incomplete sentence trying to demand importance because it actually had punctuation (a rare commodity), every undifferentiated monosyllabic piece of non-dialogue like a hobo talking to himself--it all made the book overblown and nonsensical.It just stared me down, like a huge drunk guy in a bar daring me to laugh at his misspelled tattoo. And I did. I don't know if my coworkers or the people on the bus knew what 'The Road' was about (it was years before the movie), but they had to assume it was one hilarious road, with a busfull of nuns hiding a convict in disguise on the run from a bumbling southern sheriff and his deputy; a donkey is involved.Without mentioning specifics, I will say the notorious ending of the book is completely tacked on, in no way fits with or concludes any of the emotional build of the book, but instead wraps up, neat and tight. It certainly bears out McCarthy's admission on Oprah that he ""had no idea where it was going"" when he wrote it. We can tell, Cormac.As you may have noticed from the quotes, another notorious issue is the way the book is punctuated, which is to say, it isn't. The most complex mark is the a rare comma. It's not like McCarthy is only using simple, straightforward sentences, either---he fills up on conjoined clauses and partial sentence fragments, he just doesn't bother to mark any of them.He also doesn't use any quotes in the books, and rarely attributes statements to characters, so we must first try to figure out if someone is talking, or if it's just another snatch of 'poetic license', and then determine who is talking. Sure, Melville did away with quotes in one chapter in Moby Dick, but he did it in stylistic reference to Shakespeare, and he also seemed to be aware that it was a silly affectation best suited to a ridiculous scene.It's not only the structure, grammar, figurative language, and basic descriptions which are so absurdly lacking: the characters are likewise flat, dull, and repetitive. Almost every conversation between the father and son is the same:
Father: Do it now.Son: I'm scared.Father: Just do it.Son: Are we going to die?Father: No.Son: Are you sure?Father: Yes.
Remember, you won't get little tags so you know who's speaking, it'll all just be strung out in a line without differentiation. Then they wander around for a bit or run from crazy people, and we finally get the cap to the conversation:
Son: Why did (terrible thing) just happen?Father: (Stares off in silence)Son: Why did (terrible thing) just happen?Father: (More silence)
And that’s it, the whole relationship; it never changes or grows. Nor does it seem to make much sense. The characters are always together, each the other's sole companion: father and son, and yet they are constantly distant and at odds, like a suburban parent and child who rarely see each other and have little in common. McCarthy never demonstrates how such a disconnect arose between two people who are constantly intimate and reliant on one another.But then, McCarthy confided to Oprah that the is book about his relationship with his own son, so it makes sense why the emotional content is completely at odds with the setting. Perhaps he just sat down one say and thought “I’m an award-winning author and screenwriter who has a somewhat distant relationship with my son. You know what that’s like? That’s like the unendurable physical suffering of people in the third world who are trying to find food and escape crazed, murderous mobs.” So then he wrote a book equating the two, which is about the most callous, egotistical act of privileged self-pity a writer can indulge in.At least now I know why the characters and their reactions don’t make much sense. The boy is constantly terrified, and his chief role involves pointing at things and screaming, punctuating every conflict in the book, like a bad horror film. Cannibals and dead infants are an okay (if cliche) place to start when it comes to unsettling the reader, but just having the characters react histrionically does not build tension, especially when the characters are too flat to be sympathetic in the first place. Another Creative Writing 101 lesson: if you have to resort to over-the-top character reactions to let the audience know how they are supposed to feel, then your 'emotional moment' isn't working. It's the literary equivalent of a laugh track.You know what’s more unsettling than a child screaming when he finds a dead infant? A child not screaming when he finds a dead infant. And really, that’s the more likely outcome. The young boy has never known another world--his world is death and horror. Anyone who has seen a picture of a Rwandan boy with an AK can see how children adapt to what’s around them. And you know what would make a great book? A father who remembers the old world trying to prevent his son from becoming a callous monster because of the new one.But no, we get a child who inexplicably reacts as if he’s used to the good life in suburbia and all this death and killing is completely new to him, even though we’ve watched him go through it half a dozen times already. The characters never grow numb to it, they never seem to suffer PTSD, their reactions are more akin to angst.Every time there is a problem, the characters just fold in on themselves and give up. People really only do that when they have the luxury of sitting about and ruminating on what troubles them. When there is a sudden danger before us, we might run, or freeze, but there’s hardly time to feel sorry for ourselves.There is no joy or hope in this book--not even the fleeting, false kind. Everything is constantly bleak. Yet human beings in stressful, dangerous situations always find ways to carry on: small victories, justifications, or even lies and delusions. The closest this book gets is ‘The Fire’, which is the father’s term for why they must carry on through all these difficulties. But replace ‘The Fire’ with ‘The Plot’ and you’ll see what effect is achieved: it’s not character psychology, but authorial convenience. Apparently, McCarthy cannot even think of a plausible reason why human beings would want to survive.There is nothing engaging about a world sterilized of all possibility. People always create a way out, even when there is none. What is tragic is not a lack of hope, but misplaced hope. I could perhaps appreciate a completely empty world as a writing exercise, but as McCarthy is constantly trying to provoke emotional reactions, he cannot have been going for utter bleakness. The Road is a canvas painted black, so it doesn't mater how many more black strokes he layers on top: they will not stand out because there is no contrast, there is no depth, no breaking or building of tension, just a constant addition of featureless details to a featureless whole. Some people seem to think that an emotionally manipulative book that makes people cry is better than one that makes people horny--but at least people don’t get self-righteous about what turns them on.This is tragedy porn. Suburban malaise is equated with the most remote and terrible examples of human pain. So, dull housewives can read it and think ‘yes, my ennui is just like a child who stumbles across a corpse’, and perhaps she will cry, and feel justified in doing so. Or a man might read it and think ‘yes, my father was distant, and it makes me feel like I live alone in a hostile world I don’t care to understand’; he will not cry, but he will say that he did.And so the privileged can read about how their pain is the same as the pain of those starving children they mute during commercial breaks. In the perversity of modern, invisible colonialism--where a slave does not wash your clothes, but builds the machine that washes them--these self-absorbed people who have never starved or had their lives imperiled can think of themselves as worldly, as ‘one with humanity’, as good, caring people.They recycle. They turn the water off when they brush their teeth. They buy organic. They even thought about joining the Peace Corps. Their guilt is assuaged. They are free to bask in their own radiant anguish.And it all depresses me--which makes me a shit, because I’m no more entitled to it than any other well-fed, educated winner of the genetic lottery. So when I read this book, I couldn’t sympathize with that angst and think it justified, just like I couldn’t with Holden’s. I know my little existential crisis isn’t comparable to someone who has really lost control of their life, who might actually lose life.But this kind of egotistical detachment has become typical of American thought, and of American authors, whose little, personal, insular explorations don't even pretend to look at the larger world. Indeed, there is a self-satisfied notion that trying to look at the world sullies the pure artist.And that 'emotionally pure, isolated author' is what we get from the Oprah interview. Sure, she's asking asinine questions, but McCarthy shows no capacity to discuss either craft or ideas, refusing to take open-ended questions and discuss writing, he instead laughs condescendingly and shrugs. Then again, he may honestly not have much insight on the topic.Looked at in this way, it's not surprising he won the Pulitzer. Awards committees run on politics, and choosing McCarthy is a political decision--an attempt to declare that insular, American arrogance is somehow still relevant. But the world seems content to move ahead without America and its literature, which is why no one expects McCarthy--or any American author--to win a Nobel any time soon.This book is a paean to the obliviousness of American self-importance in our increasingly global, undifferentiated world. One way or the other, it will stand as a testament to the last gasp of a dying philosophy: either we will collapse under our own in-fighting and short-sightedness, or we will be forced to evolve into something new and competitive--a bloated reputation will carry you only so far.But then, the Pulitzer committee is renowned for picking unadventurous winners--usually an unremarkable late entry by an author past their prime. As William Gass put it:
""the prize is simply not given to work of the first rank, rarely even to the second; and if you believed yourself to be a writer of that eminence, you are now assured of being over the hill""
To any genre reader, this book will have a familiar and unpleasant taste, the same one LeGuin has often lamented: that of the big name author slumming. They pop into fantasy or sci fi with their lit fic credentials to show us little folk 'how it's really done'--but know nothing about the genre or its history, and just end up reinventing the wheel, producing a book that would have been tired and dated thirty years ago. Luckily for such writers, none of their lit fic critics know anything about other genres--any sort of bland rehash will feel fresh to them, as long as you have the name-recognition to get them to look in the first place.So, McCarthy gets two stars for a passable (if cliche) script for a sci fi adventure movie, minus one star for unconscionable denigration of human suffering. I couldn't say if McCarthy's other books are any good; I will probably try another, just to see if any part of his reputation is deserved, but this one certainly didn't help. All I see is another author who got too big for his editors and, finding himself free to write whatever he wanted--only proved that he no longer has anything worth saying.
""Look, if the contemporary condition is hopelessly shitty, insipid, materialistic, emotionally retarded, sadomasochistic, and stupid, then I (or any writer) can get away with slapping together stories with characters who are stupid, vapid, emotionally retarded, which is easy, because these sorts of characters require no development. With descriptions that are merely lists ... Where stupid people say insipid stuff to each other. If what's always distinguished bad writing--flat characters, a narrative world that's ... not recognizably human, etc.--is also a description of today's world, then bad writing becomes an ingenious mimesis of a bad world ... most of us agree that these are dark times, and stupid ones, but do we need fiction that does nothing but dramatize how dark and stupid everything is?""-David Foster Wallace

6288,48090140,liked it,This wasn't nearly as funny as everybody says it is.
6288,15774805,it was amazing,"I really feel compelled to write up a review of McCarthy's The Road as this book really worked for me (for those of you who haven't read it, there are no real spoilers below, only random quotes and thematic commentary). I read it last night in one sitting. Hours of almost nonstop reading. I found it to be an excellent book on so many levels that I am at a loss as to where to begin. It was at once gripping, terrifying, utterly heart-wrenching, and completely beautiful. I have read most of McCarthy's other books and am already a big fan, but this one is different, perhaps his best in terms of lean, masterful prose, plot presentation, and flat-out brilliant storytelling.Take this passage for example: ""The blackness he woke to on those nights was sightless and impenetrable. A blackness to hurt your ears with listening. Often he had to get up. No sound but the wind in the bare blackened trees. He rose and stood tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings. An old chronicle."" Happy times! The word choice and imagery is classic McCarthy yet is leaner and more honed, tighter and in turn more intense. The whole book follows this pattern. No word, not a single one, is extraneous. This is perhaps my favorite single sentence in the book: ""By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp."" I just love that.Clearly this book struck a chord with me due to the two protagonists and their predicament, a father and his young son struggling in a post-apocalyptic world. To say I could identify with their interactions would be a huge understatement. McCarthy absolutely nails their dialog, making me marvel at how well he has mastered presenting on a page the way we communicate (it isn't exactly how we talk, of course, it just seems that way. Through some sort of magic, he writes dialog that comes across more realistically than actual dialog. Witchcraft for sure.). The young son was especially well done and was most certainly the most complicated character in the book. McCarthy presents him as a sort of supernatural being (Christ figure?), of only the best sort, full of goodness, a thing not of the world in which he finds himself. He is effortlessly drawn down the path of the righteous throughout the book, as if he is God's right hand man. The reward appears, at least superficially, to be key moments of luck.It almost wouldn't work from a literary standpoint if it didn't serve so well as a vehicle to reinforce the central theme of the book: the undeniable power of love over all else. The theme of love, mostly presented through the bond of the father and son, is so well done as to evoke strong emotions, even now, as I consider how to present its keen development throughout the novel. To be so desperate, in every way and at all times, and yet to survive and at times thrive, to persevere through terrible events of unbelievable horror (think Steven King's The Stand on steroids) would strike feelings of great, sad compassion in even the most tempered soul. But it is much more than that of course. Consider this passage, a speaking passage from father to son, spoken during one of the most tense and horrifying scenes in the book: ""You wanted to know what the bad guys looked like. Now you know. It may happen again. My job is to take care of you. I was appointed to do that by God. I will kill anyone who touches you. Do you understand?"" In this one passage, McCarthy shows the great contradiction in this theme of love, the idea that violence and beauty can spring fourth from the same well, can come from the same fountainhead. Interestingly, the father often resorts to violence in his role as a servant of love (he sees it as his duty, in a religious sense, as stated in the quote). Yet the boy never does and appears better for it, in so many ways, even in that terrible place. He is the embodiment of pure goodness, and sets up the other, better side of love, the side that is unsullied by the world, that never resorts to baseness and violence, that finds beauty in even to most unlikely of places. Like seeing a picture better when you hold it up to the light, the contrasts between these two sides is masterfully provided, page after page, in only the most well written and considered prose.The often repeated promethean phrase ""carrying the fire,"" agreed upon by the two protagonists as pretty much the whole point of their continuing, embodies this central theme. The boy is carrying the fire for us all, and is perhaps the most important survivor in that shattered world, bearing the torch of love for humanity to share when it is again ready. Not to belabor the point, but the way McCarthy handles this, all the way until the end, is nothing short of genius. Can you tell I liked the book yet? I am amazed that I missed this book for so long, me being a huge McCarthy fan and placing him squarely at the top of the ""big four"" (with DeLillo, Roth, and Pynchon). The book is so ""it's own"" that as soon as I felt myself feeling an influence (for example, I swore I smelled Hemmingway's Old Man and the Sea in terms of prose/theme, and the more terrifyingly cruel parts at times rang so much like Kosinski's The Painted Bird ), McCarthy would insert the perfect McCarthyism, solidly planting the flag (so to speak) of a phrase or sentence into the passage to claim it forever for himself, like a prosaic explorer figuratively pushing out into the unknown through deft assemblages of words and phases impossible to all but him (ok, that metaphor was way too much….time to wrap it up). Of course I have more to say but am beginning to risk (actually have already thoroughly risked) repeating myself and sounding like some deranged, McCarthy stalker-type. Check this one out. It is superior literature. "
6288,43742920,it was ok,"He palmed the spartan book with black cover and set out in the gray morning. Grayness, ashen. Ashen in face. Ashen in the sky.He set out for the road, the book in hand. Bleakness, grayness. Nothing but gray, always.He was tired and hungry. Coughing. The coughing had gotten worse. He felt like he might die. But he couldn't die. Not yet.The boy depended on him.He walked down the road, awaiting the creaking bus. It trundled from somewhere, through the gray fog. The ashen gray fog.He stepped aboard, spartan book in hand. No one spoke. They were all ghosts. Tired, wrinkled, rumpled, going wherever. Not knowing why. Just going.He opened the book and read. He began to see a pattern, a monotonous pattern of hopelessness. Chunks of gray hopelessness. Prose set in concrete, gray. Gray blocks of prose. He read.He recognized images from films long since past, and books from authors of yore. Many science fiction writers, many movie makers. He thought he saw a flash, something familiar. Perhaps it was only one of his nagging dreams. A dream of what once existed, but he did not know. Wasn't there once, he wondered, a story called ""A Boy And His Dog,"" by, who? Ellison, maybe? Was that the name? It seemed right, but his mind was unreliable. It had not been reliable in awhile. People forget. Yes, they forget. And here, a fragment, ""The Last Man on Earth,"" ""The Omega Man,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Day After,"" ""The Twilight Zone."" Yes, that one, the one about the man and the books. The broken glasses. Cannibals, people in rags, charred bodies, emptiness, grayness. ""On the Beach"" popped into his mind. His gray, dulled mind. ""The Andromeda Strain."" Dessicated bodies. Dusty, leathered, ashen bodies. The rain, the snow, the white, the cold, the gray. The endless white. The endless gray. ""Escape from New York..."" The titles seemed endless, but they blended in his wearied mind. Had he not read and seen all this a thousand times before? What was he to make of this book he held, this spartan black book, this cobbling of all that had come before, all set forth again? Was this original, he wondered? He continued to read. But he was tired, flagging. Rain, tin food, wet blankets, shivering, twigs and fire and cold. Always cold, and gray. And walking, slowly. Always walking down the road. And hiding. Hiding and walking. Ceaselessly. And atrocities. Savagery. Road warriors, the bad guys. Did this also not seem familiar? The man wondered, but his mind, like those of most of the masses, often forgot. He thanked an unseen God for this forgetfulness, for it made it easier for him to read, uncritically, unknowingly. The author, McCarthy, no doubt also must have been relieved that no one cared anymore. Plagiarism belonged to the dead past. A quaint notion of a bygone day. Not a concern, in these gray times. The times of sampling. Of plunder.My concoction is out of a tin can, he might have thought. But he did not. Tin food, prepackaged. Cans waiting to be plucked and plundered. He opened the literary beenie weenies, and served them to the world. And the world ate, hungrily ate. And believed, that beenie weenies, on their empty stomachs, tasted like the greatest gourmet dish they had ever tasted. For they knew not any better. Their gray matter just did not know.And they went on down the road.------(KR@KY 2009, amended only very slightly in 2016)NOTE: This review was written about, and during, bus rides to work while reading this book.

6288,24818763,did not like it,"I'm a terrible person because I didn't really like ""The Road"" and I'm not sure how I feel about Cormac McCarthy. Honestly, I think there's something wrong with me. I just finished reading ""The Road"" today - it only took a couple of hours to get through, because it's not that long a book, and I think it was a good way to read it because I felt really immersed in the story, which is told like one long run-on nightmare of poetic import. The characters don't get quotation marks when they speak, and for some reason McCarthy also does away with the apostrophes in words like ""couldn't"" and ""shouldn't"" - I'm still not really sure why that was necessary, it seemed a little unjustified. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world but the apocalypse itself is never really described or explained. I still don't really know why the world is the way it is as the story begins, other than that everything suddenly started burning and there are few survivors. What survivors remain are generally split into ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" - the good guys are just trying to get by and the bad guys usually kill and eat people and steal their things. A man and his boy are walking south, yet we never really know why - to get to what? Even the man, whose plan this is, never explains the rationale more than once when he thinks that it will be warmer there. We're meant to think that they're in America, I think, only there's little indicators of an American world or otherwise. At one point, near the end of the book, most of the artifacts they find are written in Spanish, which led me to think they had made it to Mexico possibly, but it still snows there, I think, which would be unusual. In other words, there are few concrete details, and a lot of small conversations between the man and the boy - the man usually says ""we have to keep going"" or ""we have to stay"" and the boy says ""i'm scared"" or ""don't leave me"" and the man says ""Don't be scared"" or ""Okay"". That was probably my biggest frustration with the book - the mundane repetitiveness of the dialogue. While many will argue that that criticism is *exactly what the author intended* (along with the amorphous location and lack of details) in order to bring about the black ethos of the novel's post-apocalypse, I just felt like it made for an uninteresting read. The language is definitely poetic and it's peppered with abstract observations about the world or life or death, but I wasn't very moved by them or the story. I didn't feel like I got to know the characters any better as the story went along - they remained distant to me emotionally, endless travelers that I could empathize with (as you would empathize with any soul wandering a post-apocalyptic desert) but I didn't really feel close to anything that happened because the narrative's disjointed and abstract tone just pushed me away as much as it made me reflect on apocalypse. I read José Saramago's novel, ""Blindness"" a year or two ago and, to be honest, felt that it dealt with mass epidemic of an apocalyptic nature in a much more convincing, original and powerful way. It contains language of stunning beauty, dialogue that lacks distinction and punctuation, and dire situations but the characters are infinitely more real, more compelling and the situations far more disturbing. What McCarthy only hints at, Saramago dares to depict throughout ""Blindness"".So, like I said, I'm sure I'm a terrible person and there's just something that I'm not getting, but I was really disappointed by ""The Road"" and generally find McCarthy and unenjoyable read. "
6288,1976245214,really liked it," The Road  is a truly disturbing book; it is absorbing, mystifying and completely harrowing. Simply because it shows us how man could act given the right circumstances; it’s a terrifying concept because it could also be a true one.It isn’t a book that gives you any answers, you have to put the pieces together and presume. For whatever reason, be it nuclear war or environmental collapse, the world has gone to hell. It is a wasteland of perpetual greyness and ash. Very little grows anymore, and the air itself is toxic. The survivors are made ill by their surroundings, physically, mentally and spiritually. They cough and splutter, they struggle to carry on and lack the will to live. Civilisation has completely collapsed, but its remnants remain: the roads remain. “On this road there are no godspoke men. They are gone and I am left and they have taken with them the world.”Thus, the man and the boy (that’s the only names we are ever given for them) walk down them. They communicate rarely, when they do it is bare and in seemingly inane phrases. At times, especially at the start of the book, when no sense of history orr time were relayed, the conversation was highly reminiscent of that in Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot. The exchanges had little to no point and were totally lacking in any substance, as the two central characters longed for something that seemed out of reach.It’s a brave narrative device, one that seems to have put off many readers. But it also articulates much about the psychological states of the man and the boy. There’s just not that much to talk about when you live in a world where you’re under constant threat from roaming gangs of cannibals catching you, dying of starvation and perhaps even exposure along with the knowledge that you will have to kill your son should the said cannibals finally catch up with you. Not to mention the sheer level of trauma and stress both characters are operating under. Staying alive is all that matters, wasting energy on words in such a situation is fruitless where you barely have the strength to walk down the road for another day.“What's the bravest thing you ever did?He spat in the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.”A dark and seemingly hopeless story unfolds. The farther and son are travelling to the beach, a distance of several hundred miles. With them they push all their worldly possessions, and resources, in a shopping cart. Such a journey seems like a fool’s errand. But what other choice do they have? The two cling onto something, a fire, a hope, that life can somehow get better. And then it continued to burn even after the mother has killed herself. This, for me, captures a large part of the human psyche: an indomitable will to survive.  The Road is suffocating; it is claustrophobic and it is entrapping. What McCarthy shows us, is that no matter how shit human society may become (has already become?) it will always have the possibility of rejuvenation. There is light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. The entire novel is an allegory, one that is not revealed until the final few pages. 

 “Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.”

6288,916236316,it was amazing,"The view that there are two independent, primal forces in the universe, one good and one evil, is called dualism. According to dualism, the good God does the best he can to promote good and combat evil but he can only do so much since evil is a powerful counterforce in its own right. The ancient Gnostics were dualists with their scriptures emphasizing the mythic rather than the historic and positing our evil world of matter created not by an all-powerful God but by a flawed deity called the Demiurge. In contrast to the Demiurge, the good God of light resides above our earthly material universe in a pure, spiritual realm called the Pleroma.I mention dualism and Gnosticism here since I read in Cormac McCarthy's novel No Country For Old Men the following dialogue between a good old Texas boy by the name of Sheriff Bell and his old Uncle Ellis:Sheriff Bell asks: “Do you think God knows what's happenin?”Uncle Ellis replies – “I expect he does.”Bell then asks – “You think he can stop it?”To this Uncle Ellis answers – “No. I dont.”By these answers, whether he knows it or not, Uncle Ellis is expressing Gnostic dualism. Of course, McCarthy's worldview isn't necessarily the worldview of one of his characters, in this case Uncle Ellis, but my sense after reading No Country for Old Men McCarthy's worldview isn't that far removed from Gnostic dualism; rather, the world and society McCarthy creates is absolutely soaking in evil. The evil is so strong in this McCarthy novel, one could say evil is the primal force of the universe.A world where evil is the primal force is given an even more complete and deeper expression in McCarthy's post-Apocalyptic novel The Road, where a man and his son travel south to avoid the oncoming winter cold. Why am I saying this? Let me offer a couple observations around two quotes:We read a reflection of the man when he was a boy about age thirteen prior to the apocalypse, ""Standing at the edge of a winter field among rough men, watching while they opened up the rocky hillside ground with pick and mattock and brought to light a great bolus of serpents perhaps a hundred in number; the dull tubes of them beginning to move sluggishly in the cold hard light. Like the bowels of some great beast exposed to the day. The men poured gasoline on them and burned them alive, having no remedy for evil but only for the image of it as they conceived it to be. The burning snakes twisted horribly and some crawled burning across the floor of the grotto to illuminate its darker recesses. As they were mute there were no screams of pain and the men watched them burn and write and blacken in just such silence themselves and they disbanded in silence in the winter dusk each with his own thoughts to go home to their suppers."" One can only wonder what brought about the actual apocalypse in the novel. Perhaps, similar to these men, world leaders attempted to remedy the image of evil on a macro level.Here is a typical scene the man and boy come upon: ""Beyond a crossroads in that wilderness they began to come upon the possessions of travelers abandoned in the road years ago. Boxes and bags. Everything melted and black. Old plastic suitcases curled shapeless in the heat. Here and there the imprint of things wrested out of the tar by scavengers. A mile on and they began to come upon the dead. Figures half mired in the blacktop, clutching themselves, mouths howling."" No more quotes are needed as I am sure you get the idea - a shadowy, menacing, ash-filled landscape populated by humans hunting and killing and eating one another.What creates the drama in this dark, sinister, stinking world is the love the man has for the boy, his son, and the love the boy has for the man, his papa. Also, the compassion the boy has for those they encounter on the road. All through their experience on the road, can we say the man holds a Gnostic-like dualist view? He experiences the intensity of the world's evil to be sure. However, his belief in a Gnostic light realm is paradoxical. Sometimes he reflects there is only this evil world of matter, harrowing and unrelenting; and yet sometimes he recognizes the boy as a messenger come from that otherworldly realm of light.Rather than attempting an answer, I suggest reading with these ideas of dualism and Gnosticism in mind as one way of contemplating and appreciating the philosophical dimensions of McCarthy’s bleak novel.Cormac McCarthy - American novelist and independent spirit par excellence "

6288,35257193,did not like it,"So I generally don't hate books - Recently when joining a face2face club they asked which book I disliked the most - and had no answer. Well I want to thank Cormac McCarthy for giving me something to be able to put there.Having heard the buzz about this book and having seen the plethora of positive reviews, I felt compelled to write my own if only to be that voice of reason in a wilderness of pretentious insanity. Cormac’s McCarthy’s The Road, I can honestly say, is the worst book I have ever read. I am stunned to find such a critical following for a novel that is so clearly bad that I have yet to meet a flesh and blood person who does not hate it, or cannot, even after the most mild inquires, explain its appeal beyond the latent thought that they “ought” to like it. To do otherwise would mark them as uncultured and ignorant. Modern art had Duchamp's toilet, and now literature has its own case of the emperor’s new clothes in, The Road.What sets this novel apart from all others in its genre of ill-conception, is the totality of its failure. There is nothing good that can be said of it. Some virtue can be found in every book, as in the old adage—“…but she has a nice personality.” The Road breaks this rule, and soundly. From the plot and characters to the writing style and even the cover design, the book is abysmally uninspired and a black hole of skill. Much has been made of the writing quality. Alan Cheuse, of the Chicago Tribune, and book commentator for NPR calls it “…his huge gift for language.” Let’s look at that for a moment. It is universally accepted that the first few sentences of any novel are the most crucial—the words which a writer labors over the most to get them just right. Here are the first two sentences of The Road: “When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he’d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before.” I once presented these two sentences to an amateur writer’s forum and asked their opinion. Several members politely replied that the sentences were badly in need of work. Not only were they not grammatically correct, but they were awkward, confusing, used several unnecessary words and had all the rhythm and pacing of a dog with four broken legs. Nights dark beyond darkness, has got to rank up there with, it was a dark and stormy night. This is not at all an isolated example. It is merely the beginning—literally. Other laudable narrative sentences include: “The Hour.” “Of a sudden he seemed to wilt even further.” “A lake down there.” Lest you think I am selectively picking the worst, here is the passage Mr. Cheuse used in his own review as an example of genius: “tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings. An old chronicle. To seek out the upright. No fall but preceded by a declination. He took great marching steps into the nothingness, counting them against his return.” What McCormac is describing here is that it is dark and the man can’t see where he is going. The author is clearly a master of communication. Let’s also pause to consider his brilliance of dialog, and his mastery of the monosyllable conversation that make the screenplay dialog of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger on par with Shakespeare. Nearly every conversation has the word “Okay,” which appears so often I began to think it was a pun, like a ventriloquist routine. One might conclude McCarthy is attempting to reflect a realistic vernacular into his work, except that the conversations are so stilted and robotic, as to lack even the faintest aroma of realism. There is no slang, no halted speech, no rambling. It is Dragnet. First dialog in the book:I ask you something? Yes. Of course. Are we going to die? Sometime. Not now. And we’re still going south. Yes. So we’ll be warm. Yes. Okay. Okay what? Nothing. Just okay. Go to sleep. Okay.You’ll note that I did not use quotes in the above excerpt. That is because neither does McCarthy. There are no quotes anywhere in the book, nor are there any tags designating the speaker, which manages to successfully make determining who is speaking quite a dilemma at times. Moreover, McCarthy never provides names to his characters this forces him to use the pronoun “he” frequently which very often leaves the reader bewildered as to whether he is referring to the father or the boy. McCarthy doesn’t stop with quotes. He rarely uses commas or apostrophes. It doesn’t appear as if he is against contractions as he uses the non-word, “dont” quite frequently. Nor is he making the statement that he can write a whole book without punctuation as he does, on rare occasions, use a comma or an apostrophe, (as you can see from the dialog segment I listed above,) as if he is going senile and merely forgot. As the lack of most of the necessary punctuation’s only result is to make it harder to read, I can only conclude that McCarthy, or his editor are the most lazy people I’ve ever heard of—although I am certain no credible editor ever saw this book. If they had I am certain we would have heard about the suicide in the papers. One might overlook the shortcomings of writing skill if the novel’s foundation was an excellent story. Sadly, this is not the case. Not that it lacks an excellent plot—it lacks a plot. Often times writers anguish over distilling the plot of a novel into a few sentences that might fit on the back of a book cover. It is often impossible to clearly convey all that a book is in such a short span. The Road does not suffer this. Instead I would imagine that if it were possible to put this book in a microwave and evaporate all the extraneous words all you would have left is one sentence: A boy and his father travel south in a post-apocalyptic United States, then the father dies. I wonder if the blurb writer for the, The Road, realized he was also providing a spoiler for the novel so comprehensive, no one need read the book. What the book lacks in plot it clearly makes up for in even less characterization. The father and the boy—that is about as much characterization as you will get. McCarthy doesn’t even provide names from which readers might glean some associative characteristics. We know the boy is afraid, because he says so approximately every four pages, always with the same robotic level of emotional intensity, backing it up with his many reasons, regrets and concerns as in the passage: I am scared. Likewise, the father is equally a pot bubbling over with emotional angst and frustration so vividly expressed in his response: I know. I’m sorry.We might as well burn all our copies of Grapes of Wrath now that we have this tour de force. As amazing as it is, with only an eggshell of plot, McCarthy manages to run afoul of logic. The boy and his father come across shelters packed with food and water, and yet the father insists they move on. Why? Because they must keep moving so as to avoid encountering others. Clearly staying in one place is the best plan to avoid meeting others, hermit do it all the time. Yes, other people might wander into you, but you double that equation if you too are roaming. The only argument for pressing on with the journey is to find others. I am certain I am being too kind here, but given that this is a Pulitzer Prize winning, Oprah Pick, National Bestseller, I don’t want to ruffle too many feathers. Of course, Duchamp's toilet (Fountain) was once voted ""the most influential modern artwork of all time""."

6288,80192882,it was amazing,"Ladies and gentlemen of Goodreads, I present to you my first five star review of 2018- The Road by Cormac McCarthy. And, ladies and gentlemen of Goodreads, here is the crazy thing. This is my THIRD time reading the book! My THIRD time! And y’all wanna know how many stars I rated this book last time? TWO! TWO WHOLE STARS! I didn’t even write a review. I just gave it two stars and moved on with my life. And now here I am with a five star review, and, folks, I can’t even explain what’s happened to me. I don’t know why I’ve had this change of heart. I don’t know why all of a sudden this book grabbed me and held me in its arms like a little baby and crushed me in the end. I have one theory though. I LISTENED to the book this time around. I’m sorry for capitalizing so many words. It just feels right for some reason. It feels RIGHT. Listening to the book forced me to slow down a little bit and take in the writing in a much different way. It allowed me to really savor the book and chew on the words a little bit before swallowing them. The book is beautiful, man, and I think it’s beauty flew right past me the first two times. Not this time though. I love apocalyptic books anyway. I loved Station Eleven. The Stand is alright. I Am Legend was awesome. But, man, McCarthy comes in with The Road and you can literally feel the bleakness and the emptiness and the desperation in his writing. You can see and smell and blackness and the ash and the cold. It’s hard to read (or listen to) sometimes because it’s just so hopeless, and you know nothing good is coming. You know there can’t be some happy ending waiting for you. There’s no way. Not in the world he’s created. But for a book so cold and dark, it’s also poetic and beautiful. McCarthy’s short sentences and minimal words in his dialogues work great in this world, and it all adds to the overall tone of the story. Boy howdy, I’ve had an awesome JanuMcCarthyary so far.

6288,62982761,it was amazing,"I finished this novel quite a few days ago. Normally, I would hop right up and start composing my little goodreads ramble, publish whatever nonsense came out, and go about my day. This novel, however, left me feeling like an incubus was on my chest, paralyzing my brain and limiting my mobility. I set it down and stared at the ceiling. I rolled around in bed feeling anxious and nostalgic and terrible and serene. I hid it in my backpack so I wouldn’t continue to be tortured by seeing the spine, and contemplating how it was defeating me. This loud-mouth, this rambler, this conversational ram-rodder had, in a rare instance of humbling, found herself with nothing to say. So many thoughts, and no words to frame them in. I finally placed the book back on the shelf, acknowledged that I had read it through the meager gesture of rating, and started with something else. After a few days had passed, I decided to try and pin down the numerous specimens that are my thoughts. I won’t wow you like the story does. I won’t offer any insight that isn’t present elsewhere on goodreads in the many, many fantastic reviews that have already conquered this territory to the extent that it is conquerable. I will get a bit self-indulgent and tell you embarrassing, private things that you may or may not care to read about concerning my life and my family, because this novel is largely about the preciousness of life and the preciousness of family, of the horror and the beauty and everything in between. It is a somber meditation on subtle, enormous things. I am predisposed toward loving post-apocalyptic novels. In many ways, I blame this on my obsession with the “Boxcar Children” books whenever I was a kid. Though these books are, of course, NOT post-apocalyptic tales, they do depict a world that is about as barren and frightening as a 9 year old lower-middle-class girl can wrap her mind around. The idea that you have no home, no parental figures, no reliable source of food or comfort, and basically nothing save your siblings, is a scary and fascinating thing to think about. With a home life as precarious as my own, it didn’t seem terribly far-fetched to some day find myself destitute, and I found deep comfort in the children’s will to survive. Unfortunately, I eventually did find myself in a comparable situation when, in the midst of my parents’ divorce, my 5 year old sister and I went to live with our father in this giant, shadowy house on a stretch of land in one of Oklahoma’s smaller towns, a place far from the protection of my mother, and far from all of the friends I had grown up around and came to trust and love. In a consuming fit of depression, my father basically isolated himself from the realm of the living, sleeping most hours, and silently and heavily self-medicating in a darkened den when “awake.” I was 11, and was forced to take on the domestic duties of a full-grown woman in order to care for my sister, ensure we both ate, walk her to school and back every day, maintain a moderately clean home, tiny, shoddy Christmas trees out of tree branches, etc etc etc. Though I realize this sounds like a sob story, let me assure you it was short-lived, and that when I finally abandoned my blind loyalty to my father and made with the truth, we were snatched up that very day, and the world was bright and rosy again from then on. Also, I am actually pretty glad that it happened. My brief experience in this alternate reality had some enormous character-building effects, and was actually sort of fun sometimes in this “I’m really living out this whole self-reliance thing that I’ve read so much about” sort of way. I mean, it got old quick. However, the most important effects that it had on me as a person (aside from making me feel capable of handling a whole lot of bullshit, weathering the storms of life, yadda yadda) were a) binding my sister and I in an unbreakable way and b) making me see seemingly obvious bits of the process of living (food, tiny little gifts, things like Christmas lights and Easter eggs and really warm gloves) as the precious objects that we so often forget that they are. But we are discussing The Road, here.The emphasis on precious little things composes much of the story. There is a lot of what some may call “filler” throughout the novel; descriptions of meals, the process of preparing the meals, of the characters disrobing layer by layer in order to clean themselves in the extremely rare warm bath they manage to take, washing every bit of themselves and every layer of clothing, stitching up a wound, wrapping up the wound, pulling a pant-leg over the wound. Though the form of each sentence, of the entire novel even, could arguably be considered curt, it is a conscious choice. Each sentence is presented like a precious object, a simple little thing which is, in its very simplicity, some exquisite testimonial to the process of living and loving. Even the dialogue is stripped bare, exhibiting the boundless love of the Man and the Boy in the simplest of exchanges more effectively than some sprawling monologue or melodramatic, Shakespearean dialogue would have been able to. They don’t even have to say “I Love You.” It simply is.It’s so rare to find a voice such as McCarthy’s that can say so much with so very little. I have spent a lot of time reading about Japanese culture, and one of the many immensely interesting things that I have come across is the lack of a direct translation of the phrase “I Love You.” There are, of course, ways to express affection, and adoration, and even obsession. Yet, the notion that we attach so much meaning to, the three words you may hear from a lover and feel anything from overwhelming, butterflies-in-the-brain-like joy to crap in your pants and the early symptoms of a heart attack, the three words that can make or break a human connection, these three words are not translatable in a literal sense. This fascinated me enough to approach one of my college professors from Japan and ask her to tell me why. Her response was to say that something so enormous just couldn’t be put so simply, should not be flattened down and thrown around in the way that this limited phrase allows, and that it is almost obscene to assume everything involved in deep love can be encompassed in such a stunted bit of words. Though Japanese culture has sort of “whipped up” some ways to express a similar sentiment, it is more often than not used to placate Western lovers, is still quite limiting as to how they really feel, and even then is rarely used. Expression of the emotions coded in “I Love You” is preferably accomplished through a culmination of millions of different actions, tiny little kindnesses that aren’t named as kindnesses, minuscule, stacking pieces of the “I Love You’ puzzle. Well, this novel feels distinctly Japanese in this, along with many other, ways. Bare-bones, humble respect for every cell of every mass of the life process. The simplest of gestures binding together to communicate giant feelings. Reverence for the smallest bits of life, as they are crucial elements of the whole. At the risk of contradicting everything I just said, I would argue that the sentence which most communicates the moral underpinning this wonderful story is this: ""When one has nothing left make ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them."" Allow me to be a bit clearer: I strongly suggest that you read this book."
6288,186229558,really liked it,"A good friend gave this to me to read. I told him I already had an audiobook working and he said, ""you'll want to read this one"". I could barely put it down. Mesmerizing. McCarthy's prose is simple, fable like, yet also lyrical, like a minamalistic poet. The portrait he has painted is dark and foreboding, difficult and painful, yet he carries ""the fire"" throughout, a spark of hope and love that must be his central message to the reader. Having read the book, not sure if I want to see the film, it may spoil my vision of McCarthy's art. **March 2017 and I still have not seen the film and still don't think I will."
6288,421922373,it was amazing," I have nightmares similar to what Cormac McCarthy depicted in his book.I’m with my family. Sometimes, it’s just my son and I. The dystopia might not be the nuclear winter portrayed here, but it has the same type of vibe. Rampant fear and chaos, breakdown of society, everyone pitted against everyone else and my only thought is to somehow hold my family together and protect them.Or we’re traveling or holed up somewhere and everything is quiet and we’re suddenly overrun.Fear is the core. Fear is the motivator. Fear is the wind; the element that upsets the precarious balance on the tightrope of our existence. We straddle the thin rope that encompasses our hope and will. It’s a long way down into the abyss, but the dark looks comforting – inviting.In light of this, the specific situations depicted in the book raise some questions for me:I love my family but could I be as resourceful as “the man”? Under the dreadful circumstances, would I have the same patience as “the man”?If faced with the dilemma of no food, would I give up?Would I consider myself one of the “good guys”?Would I carry ""the fire""?This was a buddy read with Kelly and Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*."
6288,34559379,it was amazing,"A man and his young son are traveling along a highway, hoping to get far enough south to avoid the onslaught of winter. It is a post apocalyptic landscape, heavy with ash, in which you can hear the absence of birds chirping or bugs buzzing. The language is remarkable. I was reminded of Thomas Hardy for beauty of language, but it is a different sort of beauty. McCarthy uses short declaratives, as if even language was short of breath in the devastation, and terrorizes generations of elementary school english teachers by tossing off verbless phrases as sentences (p 27 - A river far below.) He is effective in turning nouns into verbs, as on p4 – “when it was light enough to use the binoculars he glassed the valley below.” Forgetting the content of the narrative this is a masterwork of style. I was deeply moved by not only the technical skill with which he molds language to his purpose, but the effective emotional impact of the work. This is a book to read slowly, to savor, not one to speed through to hasten ingestion of the plot. There are events that are exceedingly grim in this, focusing on despair, suicide, cannibalism. Yet the love of the father for his son is palpable and despite the omnipresent gray ash, there remain slivers of hope. Highly recommended, but this is not a book for those with a weak stomach. "
6288,61537207,did not like it,"I just read some guy's review of The Road that contained the following:""In the three hours that I read this book I found myself crying, laughing, shouting, and most of the time my lip was trembling. ... As soon as I finished it, I sat there feeling numb, but not in a bad way, actually sort of like I was high.""Wow, dude. I mean, really? Your lip was trembling? And you felt high? And your lip was trembling? Pherphuxake, what do you even say to someone like that?---------------------------------------------------------------------The Road by Cormac McCarthy is an awful, awful book. I have to consciously restrain myself from judging those of you who believe the book has merit. Don’t worry, the fact that I’m part of a very small minority in this regard (only the smartest 3% of my fellow Goodreads bibliophiles also gave The Road a one-star review) has not escaped me. I am nevertheless convinced of the objective correctness of my position—notwithstanding the inherent subjective nature of any literary discussion—and I will maintain with my dying breath that The Road should have been named The Rod because it represents nothing more than Cormac McCarthy’s attempt to proclaim to the world that he has a big literary dick.I have constructed a list of factors that increase a book’s suck quotient and I fear The Road exhibits most of them. Let’s check my list and see which things appear in The Road:• A plot that lacks clear beginning or ending (check) • Important characters who don't grow or learn from their experiences (check)• Important characters whose actions lack clear motivation (check)• Scenes and dialogue that are repetitive or unoriginal (check) • Violence and gore included for shock value (check) • Locations and settings that are ambiguous (check) • History and backstory that are ambiguous (check) • Grammar and punctuation used in a pretentious or self-indulgent manner (check) • Pronouns and punctuation used in an ambiguous manner (check) • Metaphors and analogies that appear contrived, forced and disjointed (check) Okay, to be fair The Road doesn’t exhibit most of the suck-quotient factors; it exhibits all of them. It's as though McCarthy deliberately designed his book to be the antithesis of what I think makes for quality reading.Now before I get any further, let’s get a couple of things out of the way. Much is made of McCarthy’s failure to use quotation marks and other punctuation, with some finding it brilliant and some finding it pretentious and self-indulgent. I make my home in the pretensions-and-self-indulgent camp. In fact I find McCarthy’s treatment of punctuation nauseating; it is his way of saying:“My words are so beautiful, perfect, and complete that they stand on their own. I require no punctuation to convey my meaning. Indeed my message is too powerful to be contained by the same convention that restricts the middling novelist, too important to suffer the vandalism of punctuation.”Thus, leaving out punctuation can be not only confusing for the reader, but also revoltingly self-indulgent and arrogant. However, that being said, I don’t believe The Road sucks merely because it lacks quotation marks. I’m okay with such a tool if it’s used for a purpose that adds to the message being conveyed, à la Blindness. So punctuation is not the only suck-quotient factor here. Instead, I believe The Road sucks because it sucks every possible way a book can suck. The purposeless lack of quotation marks and other punctuation is merely one symptom of the enormity of the book’s suckitude.It’s important to understand that this is not just a matter me disliking The Road. I have an almost vehement reaction to The Road and to the rather large group of slobbering, screaming, panties-throwing admirers. In the interest of intellectual honesty, I challenged myself to figure out why this is. Why can’t I just abhor The Road while letting other people have their moronic fun? Why must I look down on people who love The Road with a feeling of disgusted superiority? Why do I care if others enjoy the mental equivalent of dipping bread into horse diarrhea and pretending it’s award-winning fondue?It took some soul-searching to learn the answer: I react vehemently to The Road because fans and critics of literature love to stroke McCarthy’s Rod, while works of science fiction—my favorite genre—are dismissed regardless of their merit. Critics praise The Road but glibly waive off sci-fi as a genre for people who never grew out of their childlike amusement for light sabers or their adolescent fascination with space battles. Sci-fi is relegated to its own awards and events, left out of consideration for broader literary honors, leaving me with the impression that the literary world does not perceive sci-fi to be real, legitimate literature. But from my point of view The Road is the adolescent work. By the standards under which I would judge a quality sci-fi novel (or any quality novel), The Road is shallow and simple, along with unoriginal and obvious. The Road is to my favorite sci-fi as a toddler’s splashing pool is to Lake Tahoe. It is beyond me how The Road can be the guest of honor while much deeper books with beautiful language and original, thought-provoking ideas are not even invited to the party because they happen to be sci-fi.Of course the other 97% disagree with my assessment of The Road as shallow and unoriginal. They believe that I just didn't get it, that I couldn’t see past McCarthy’s prose and unconventional punctuation. They tell me The Road is rich and deep. They tell me to forget the quotation marks and the nameless characters and look at what McCarthy is trying to tell us. The Road tells us this, and it talks about that, and speaks to this other thing. Then the 38% who gave The Road five stars lose themselves in their collective self-amplified group hysteria. “The Road is so so so great!” they yell in unison. “Please take my panties, Mr. McCarthy!” they yell at some imaginary stage. “Here, Mr. McCarthy please sign my boobs!” And that’s where I have to walk away.The thing is, though, I didn’t have a difficult time seeing what The Road tells us and talks about and speaks to; I just didn't find any of it to be especially deep, enlightening, or insightful. The book was easy to read and simple to comprehend. It didn’t make me think. Everything was right there on the surface, served with a spoon, and what we were served had no flavor, no spice, no originality. So it’s not that The Road lacks all substance. If it weren’t for the nonstop nauseating self-indulgence I would have given it two stars and might recommend it to people who are new to the reading scene. My problem is that, for something so beloved and critically acclaimed, for something written by a writer with such talent, The Road fails utterly, a shell without substance that collapses in upon itself in a heap of triteness and unoriginality. To put it yet another way, The Road was just so goddamn boring.I want a book that makes me pay attention and use my noggin. I want to work at peeling back layers and making connections. When I find them, I want the author's ideas and insights to be original, edifying, and thought-provoking. I want artful prose, relatable characters, realistic motivations, and poetic plot points. And guess what, I find no shortage of books on the sci-fi shelves that meet those criteria.Now let’s see if we can tie things together. There are plenty of truly excellent books of contemporary literature; I have read and enjoyed several, including one or two that have touched me deeply. Likewise there are plenty of truly excellent books on the sci-fi genre. For some reason one genre is invited to the party and the other isn’t. I don’t know why that is, beyond an apparent assumption made by haughty critics and readers that sci-fi is for kids. Now, I’m not trying to say that all sci-fi is wonderful. There’s plenty of crappy sci-fi out there, just like there’s plenty of crap in any genre. My point is simply that, despite the dismissive attitude of many literary critics, the sci-fi shelves contain books that are as good as anything out there: books as rich and complex, as insightful and layered, as edifying and beautiful as anything in contemporary literature. So when something like The Road is hailed as a masterpiece while some truly brilliant works of sci-fi—works that could mop the floor with The Road in every facet— are acknowledged only by a roll of the eyes ... well, I think you see why I can’t be happy just to dislike The Road and let everyone else have their fun."
6288,2115811884,really liked it,This is one of the saddest books about a father and child that I have ever read in my life . . yet. There were a couple of happy times. Not so much though =( Mel ♥
6288,81048719,it was amazing,"The main point I want to deal with is how I managed to walk away from this book with a trenchant sense of gratitude at the forefront of my mind. I certainly won’t mislead and paint this story as one that directly radiates things to be happy about, but I do think it does so indirectly (and the term ""happy"" is far too facile for my purposes here). This is an extremely dark tale of a world passed through a proverbial dissolvent. A world stripped of its major ecological systems. Small pockets of homo sapiens remain and virtually all other animal and vegetative life has vanished. For the Father and the Boy—the core characters of the novel who are holding onto to their existence by the most tenuous of threads—for them nearly every moment consists of terror and misery. Food is extremely scarce. Fellow humans are often very likely to kill and eat them. There’s an utter lack of good prospects on the horizon. And when terror seems less immediate and they have a moment to become lost in the luxuries of long-term memory, the thoughts tend to be ones of painful regret and helplessness and are just as bleak as the immediate surroundings and circumstances. A REALLY, REALLY SAD AND SCARY TALE. Okay. It’s fitting—albeit in a superficial, mundane coincidence type of fashion—that I’m reading The Road for the first time as soon as the temperatures in my cartographic slice of things have just plummeted to single-digit degrees. The slow death of autumn has given way to the inescapable, temporary halt of much organic hustle and bustle. The skies often tend to merge with the washed out grays and whites of the landscape. As almost goes without saying, the world of McCarthy’s unexplained apocalypse is one in which each day is more gray than the last. So there seems to be some veneer of kinship between this world and my current surroundings, but what’s more important—far, far more important—are the manifold differences. Compared to the bleak world of the book that sits to my left, the nonfictional winter of the Chicago tri-state area is a veritable paradise. Colors are still abundant, if you choose to notice them. The buildings, cars and clothes we encase ourselves in—in sum—still display a wide range of colors, patterns, novelties, and so on, which to an eye accustomed to and expectant of tattered gray wastelands would appear as an orgiastic celebration of beauty and eyesight like none other. Though sunlight is less abundant now than in other seasons we are still, often enough, visited by a warmth and illumination that comes from that distant, worship-worthy star above, as opposed to a random explosion from some chunk of flammable infrastructure releasing its dying breath, or from a meager fire knelt over and struggled to bring to life. In full disclosure, I can’t say that anyone has ever accused me of being an optimist. I’ve held the deed to boatloads—jam-packed harbors of them—of cynicism, despair, and all the other synonyms for negative emotional states and psychological dispositions. But I also feel that the struggle against nihilism, apathetic numbness, and ascetic ideology of all stripes is The Great Foundational Struggle for myself, and for my fellow strange hairless primates to take up and take up with vigor. To be able to look uncertainty, intuitive pessimism, our own impending demise, and even the gaping void of eternity squarely in its facelessness and still wrest away something profoundly good and meaningful. I’ve also been no stranger to the wishful-yearning to abandon my human cognitive faculties, our apparently unique ability to look forward, to anticipate, to construct possibilities, outcomes, goals, to direct wonder and desire at and upon the world around and within us, and to reflect upon these very things and the reflection itself, the reflection itself, the reflection itself... These useful evolutionary adaptations (and their attendant byproducts) often feel like a burden to those who also have the aforementioned boatloads somehow connected to their person. The burden is simply in the fact that where one can see ahead they can see ahead to miserable outcomes. I used to mentally nod in agreement when Craig Schwartz, in Being John Malkovich, remarks to his wife’s pet chimpanzee that ""Consciousness is a curse."" I used to quasi-proudly cite the Samuel Johnson quote at the beginning of Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas that ""He who makes a beast out of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man."" And one dramatic evening the man singing the song [which has been removed from the top of the review now] literally slapped me and metaphorically awoke me from this nihilistic slumber by pointing to the words ""pain of being man"" which were scrawled, in my hand, upon a miniature American flag and screamed something to the effect of ""This is something you can't ever fully get rid of!"" What is basically an obvious truth hit me like a ton of bricks, the way that certain obvious yet somehow elusive truths are want to do. It was a moment that, say, Nietzsche would’ve been proud of, as he was brilliant at and adamant in his fight against nihilism and opposed to treating pain as something merely to be avoided rather than faced and even, in some ways, embraced. In sum, wishing away our nature, our circumstance, our humanity—this is no better and no less cowardly than blissfully strolling along as if everything’s coming up roses when the world crumbles around you. It’s a rejection of the present world--a sigh of resignation, signed, sealed, delivered. We have to learn to do something with our terror and woe. Pronouncing it terminal and sitting back to watch the world turn to cinders and dust is no longer an option, and precisely because of how dire many of our situations truly are.There’s a tremendously powerful scene in which the Father and the Boy discover an underground bunker filled with food and various supplies. The joy and relief they feel in that bunker is the metaphorical core of where gratitude lies in terrible situations. My bunker, our bunker, is generally much more vast in the present nonfictional world of circumstances--both the circumstances that we share and the ones that are enclosed within. And yet somehow this gratitude is not really any easier to find and possess in a lasting way than the literal bunker that briefly acts as a protective womb for the central characters of this dark and harrowing tale. This is all to say that there is something very important about finding real silver linings and that in rejecting so many false ones we may accidentally toss out the genuine ones. Genuine goodness gets caught so easily in our blind spots. ""What a wonderful thing to be alive and given to hungering.""—Death Rattle Orchestra, ""The Hand's Mouth""Books like this that contain such magnificently terrible visions of a doomed planet, also contain the impetus to appreciate things once taken for granted and to cherish and protect these things with every fibre of one’s being. They also contain a pulse of something that is purely beautiful such as the relationship between the Father and the Boy. Clearly, they represent some sort of triumph of perseverance, but not at all in the glib, mindless language of motivational posters, but in a hard-nosed, realistic manner that taps into deep and serious feelings and verifiable realities, rather than delusional slogans recited to keep general unpleasantness at bay. The story doesn’t end happily ever after, not by a long shot, but there are real triumphs all along the way and these don’t vanish simply because we aren’t served up every fulfilled desire on a silver platter. Such is life. The world is not drained of meaning simply because it is finite and partially composed of fallibility, uncertainty, and things generally that fall short of our yearned-for ideals. The triumphs are real. 
He held the boy by the hand and they went along the rows of stenciled cartons. Chile, corn, stew, soup, spaghetti sauce. This richness of the vanished world. Why is this here? the boy said. Is it real?Oh yes. It's real.
Anything that can shake a person to their core and set off a chain of thoughts that leads to the desire to live better than before, perhaps ethically, or to allow them to feel things more profoundly—such as gratitude and amazement at the very fact of anything existing at all—deserves all the praise it can get. As far as I’m concerned Cormac McCarthy’s writing is now praise-worthy in this way."
6288,64404137,it was amazing,"Phew. This is a brilliant, bleak, beautiful book, but an emotionally harrowing one, albeit with uplifting aspects (they always cling to a sliver of hope, however tenuous).PLOTThere isn't much. But that's fine by me. In the near future, a man and his son traipse south, across a cold, barren, ash-ridden and abandoned land, pushing all their worldly goods in a wonky shopping trolley. They scavenge to survive and are ever-fearful of attack, especially as some of the few survivors have resorted to cannibalism. Much of the time almost nothing happens, yet that makes it all the more compelling. The boy is very imaginative, empathetic, moral and scared - a difficult combination in the circumstances. There is a deep love and care between man and boy, each projecting their own survival instinct on to the other. In their anxiety, aspects of their relationship take on a ritualistic tone, and some of their conversations are almost liturgical, invariably ending with an assurance that they're the ""good guys"" and things will be ""okay"", yet without becoming banal.Sometimes they are more wary of being seen than others, and at one point I wondered how much was ""real"" and how much might be imagined or paranoia, but that doubt passed. Whatever disaster caused the destruction (it is never explained) was some years before and the father realises that despite their closeness, in some ways ""to the boy he was himself an alien. A being from a planet that no longer existed.""WRITING STYLEVery distinctive and controversial. It is written in a sparse, somewhat poetic style (""cold autistic dark""), often detached (the characters are never named) and fragmented, to match the setting of the book. Even quotation marks and apostrophes are almost absent (used only where their absence might create ambiguity, e.g. we're and were). Initially, I found this pared down language and especially punctuation distracting and infuriating, but when I let go of that, treated it as more of a poem, the minimalism became integral to my appreciation. In fact, it somehow enhances the impact of the story, rather than distracting from it. If it were typset as a prose poem, it might raise fewer hackles. In fact I think I think one reason some people don't ""get"" this book is that they read it as a novel that hasn't been proofread, rather than immersing themselves in it as a prose poem.Much has been made of the intriguingly odd phrase ""The snow fell nor did it cease to fall"", which leapt off the page at me and is also discussed on Language Log: http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/....RELATED WORKSA film is coming out in the autumn. It could be excellent, but if they try to make it too cheerful, it would lose its purpose.UPDATE: I saw the film, and was impressed (and surprised), but still prefer the book.WARNING: Having enjoyed this, I had high hopes for Outer Dark (my review here http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), but unfortunately I really didn't like that. I'm unsure whether to read more Cormac McCarthy now."
6288,22451421,it was amazing,"This book is shocking, loving, groundbreakingly impressive, beautifully written. I read through it without breathing, I mean I just had to know what was coming on the next page, and cried several times. Without a doubt one of the best books, if not the best, I read, ever..."
6288,2041160444,it was amazing,"Five Stars  For Brilliant Story Telling: It really doesn’t get any better than this. The story is a journey, an epic journey, a hero’s journey. The prose is sparse and real in its immediacy. We not only read it but feel it, smell it, taste it. That is a rare treat for any reader.Five Stars  For Best Father and Son Relationship: The father and his son in this book have such a strong bond, it is both heart wrenching and inspiring to share it. On their long journey, they teach each other, mostly by example, how to live in a world that is unlivable. How to survive, how to protect, how to love.Five Stars  For Most Creative Environment: The world of this book is not beautiful. It is filled with ash, the sun is barely visible through the thick pollution of the atmosphere, most trees destroyed or falling down; roads have melted and then cooled again, streams and rivers and even the ocean an off-shade of gray. It is a dead world that has not yet begun to come back to life, and we do not know if it ever will.Six Stars  For Pulling Me Out of my Comfort Zone and Making Me Like It: Post-apocalyptic or dystopian writing is not a genre I feel comfortable with for various reasons. Having said that, this is one of those very rare stories that seems to cut across all genres, grabs hold, and doesn’t let you go – even after the last page.I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who might be interested in the above Star points."
6288,36247400,did not like it,"I’m trying to find solace in the fact that I’m probably not the only one to be humiliatingly hoodwinked into taking the time to read Cormac McCarthy’s much-celebrated yawn-fest “The Road”, although this hardly makes this bamboozling something to boast about. In spite of the fact approximately three-fourths of the world seemed to readily embrace this as worthy fare, I managed to keep my distance for some time, mainly through ignorance of the general plot of the book and my usual stubborn reluctance to blindly jump off a bridge with the masses. I should have obeyed my gut instinct and remained one of the few spared the tedium of “The Road”, but then I had to go and actually examine a copy from a carefully-arranged pile resembling some kaleidoscopic, symmetrical form that some unfortunate, underpaid bookslut had to labor over for hours to create, and noticed that not only did this win the Pulitzer Prize, but happened to be a post-apocalyptic tale, and nothing stirs my loins nearly as vigorously. I’d even had it suggested by one of my fellow goodreaders, and after brief contemplation as to whether to waste my money on this alleged masterpiece or another box of nitrous cartridges, I decided that it was time to see what all the fuss was about (regarding “The Road”, I think I can understand the allure of the EZ Whip cream chargers, especially when you’ve got one of those bigass punch-ball balloons). 	I sat in a numbed stupor while I read this, completely baffled as to how the hell this managed not only to win awards of great prestige, but, more importantly, just how it managed to be a commercial success with the ordinary reader. I’m almost interested to hear why someone might have actually enjoyed “The Road”, in which McCarthy somehow managed to make boring the concept of post-apocalyptic America. While I usually happen to be a fan of the genre, I found this to be everything which I don’t desire within that intriguing realm. At this point, I’m obviously begging for someone to come along and tell me that I ‘didn’t get it’, and probably point out that I’m a moron for good measure. I’m not denying that these are certainly valid arguments, but convincing me that I didn’t like this book is going to be impossible, my cheeky little friend. 	So, what did I get from “The Road”, which stupefies me with its status as a #1 bestseller and Pulitzer-winning tour de force? Several things, all of them sucky; a whole lot of repetitive and boring conversation and redundant let’s-trek-towards-the-coast plodding, a lot of stupidass and harebrained compoundwords, and an insipid amalgam of fiftyword paragraphs that seldom accomplished anything as far as entertaining me as a reader. 	Here’s the story in a nutshell, for anyone who might be inexplicably reading this without having read the book; probably because they were wise enough to invest in the EZ Whip instead, and are now dicking around with their iTunes trying to find the song that best complements that flanging sound in their head. Some sort of catastrophe has befallen planet Earth, and I have to admit I was pretty interested to find out the nature of this calamity, but McCarthy decides to keep that a secret for some reason beyond my grasp, maybe as the highlight of “The Road 2: Thoroughfare”. Ok, I can dig it, whatever it was, I know that it had no trouble fucking up Earth’s weak and fragile little blue ass. Score; Unexplained Devastating Event 1, Earth 0. Does it really matter what might have happened, seeing as all it resulted in was the end of almost all life as we know it? Actually, yeah, the lack of any sort of input regarding the origin of this chain of events does suck, and badly. Score: Utter Buffoonishness 1, Cormac McCarthy 0. 	In the wake of, well, whatever cataclysmic shit happened, we’ve got a father and son struggling to survive in the resulting aftermath, and things aren’t very promising for this enterprising duo, as whatever wiped out the inhabitants of planet earth also eradicated not only all plant and animal life, but in a shocking display of sheer spite also managed to do away with quotation marks, colons, semicolons, and most hyphens. Survivors of this worldwide holocaust are few and far between: scattered bands of humans that have largely resorted to thuggishness and cannibalism for lack of other hobbies or nutrition, a few mushrooms, and question marks, periods, and a wily subset of apostrophes have managed to escape extermination. The father and son have managed to eke out a regrettable existence for an unknown number of years, and the approaching winter promises to be outrageously cold, so they make way for an unnamed southern coastline, where I can only presume they're expecting to encounter something more accommodating. 	Their journey is perhaps the most ridiculously boring shit I’ve ever read. They push a shopping cart along with their scant supplies while alternately stomping through ash and sleeping in ditches. Once in a while they encounter another survivor, each meeting completely preposterous and without substance. They ransack homes and forage for food, they abandon the weak and feeble, they ramble incessantly, engaging in snippets of pointless conversation, usually about how they cannot give up, as they are ‘carrying the fire’. I’m assuming that ‘the fire’ is the inextinguishable hope for mankind, a barely flickering light personified in the child, or maybe the fact that any chance of repopulating may depend on their ash-coated and unwashed swinging schlongs, who the hell knows, the ‘fire’ could be their undiminished belief in god which they’ll impart on the cannibal savages running unchecked when not feasting on fetus. 	That’s it. Seriously, that’s the story, and I’ve long since abandoned any attempt to discover what all the hype surrounding this supposed ‘story’ is. 	Despite my generally low opinion of our collective taste as a species, I found myself shocked that “The Road” was deemed favorable by so many. But what I really can’t wrap my head around is the critical acclaim, which applauds this for reasons I’ll never understand, and sincerely hope the critics don’t either. I found the storytelling utterly regrettable and lacking in all possible aspects, once in a while McCarthy bizarrely waxed poetic, and he also made the completely unforgivable mistake of mentioning how the ‘sun went around the earth’, which, if intended to be literal, at least offers an explanation as to why the planet is becoming so inhospitable. Otherwise, all Cormac has to offer is a bunch of really short, uninteresting sentences, banal murmurings between father and son, and a whole lot of tedium. I might almost be impressed that on several occasions McCarthy busted out some word which I’ve previously never seen before in my life (woad and siwash come to mind, both forever burnt in my brain as examples of meaningless gibberish), but when the use of these words is considered next to the rest of the prose, composed of rudimentary language, all it called to mind was the disheartening suspicion that McCarthy stumbled across these relics from some Word-Of-The-Day vocabulary-enhancing calendar, making them seem improbably forced into the story: 	June 14th: WOAD: n, some absurd, obscure shit. 	“Hmmmm,” Cormac ponders this treasure, “I may have to have the protagonists come across a load of woad.” He chuckles idiotically. “A load. Heh. Of woad. Heh heh.”	While the Woad Incident was bad enough, McCarthy also uses ‘wonky’. Christ, the last time I heard wonky used was in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, coming from Master Blaster. This made for a pretty fitting connection between the two, both being pieces of post-apocalyptic poodle piddle. After getting an unsavory sampling of the author’s propensity for rarely-seen words, I was half expecting to see rampike, which would have actually worked in the context of the story on countless occasions, but apparently that one was included in Roget’s Word-Of-The-Day and our man McCarthy was given the Merriam-Webster last Christmas.	Now I’m just nit-picking, for lack of anything else to comment on, since this was so devoid of action, intrigue, or anything remotely thought-provoking."
6288,403410194,it was amazing,"“What would you do if I died?If you died I would want to die too.So you could be with me?Yes. So I could be with you.Okay.” --McCarthy4/6/18 Re-reading this for my spring 2o18 Climate Change class, and even knowing how it ends, I am wrecked, just devastated by this book, so horrific and so beautiful and moving. Sobbing as I do at the most intimate of losses, but feeling the intensity of any great passionate beauty, too. The beauty of a great book that helps you see what matters.9/1/14 Original review, edited a bit in the light of my most recent reading.An amazing book. So powerful, understated, majestic, moving. Just blew me away. Some one said this was a ""dictionary"" book, meaning that they had to look up words a lot, and yes, it is a book that loves language, some of it ancient and forgotten, maybe befitting the subject of loss, but McCarthy is always this blend of Faulknerian epic-loss-language and Hemingway's power-through-simplicity-language. Some of the cadences are Biblical, as in King James elevated language, as in The Grapes of Wrath and Cry, The Beloved Country. And the simple, devastating power of Of Mice and Men and The Old Man and the Sea. Books of allegorical significance and moral power.In a way, this tale, set years after nuclear holocaust and environmental devastation, is a kind of guide for the apocalypse--any apocalypse, the Big One, your own or a loved one's death, the end of anything--with principle, with character, dignity and love; in this case, it is a father and son facing oblivion, moving forward, Pilgrim's Progress, ""carrying the fire"" against all odds, never giving up, and it is heartbreaking and devastating. You wonder, like them, whether you could or can go on. This simple, bleak tale has a kind of echo in it of Dylan Thomas's ""Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night,"" where Thomas urges his own father to fight death and not just acquiesce to it, or give into it. The man in this story teaches his son to fight to stay alive and be one of the ""good guys"" (or, ethical) with any means available at their disposal. In this simple, bleak dystopian story, we are very possibly at the end of time, in an ash, Beckettian landscape, waiting for Godot, people reduced to their most animal selves. And yet, there are relationships that remain, with simple pleasures, enjoyed by fathers and sons. The find a can of Coke, they eat a can of peaches, they tell each stories, they draw pictures, they play a primitive flute they have made, the arts comforting and sustaining them when they need it.Recently, we had the suicide of Robin Williams, someone we had come to believe we knew well through movies where he played characters urging us to laugh and seize the day, every day. But he was playing characters in movies, and we began, as we do, I suspect, to make the mistake of believing that the convincingly hopeful characters he played were internalized in his own soul. And maybe they were, for a time. Camus said, post-Hiroshima, post-Holocaust, that suicide was the only important philosophical question that remained, and McCarthy, aging as we all are, helps us contemplate this question, too, as we face or imagine facing devastation, death, that nuclear winter. Throughout the book the man speaks to or reflects on his wife, years gone, who made another choice than he has, and given what they faced, she faced, a reasonable one, and one the man teaches his son to passionately resist, though in his quietest moments, he longs for it himself. When they encounter an old man, a kind of dark seer, on the road they speak of luck and what it can mean in such a time, and neither are sure what it even means anymore: Is it luckier to live or die in the face of the very end? The man has no hope, though: “People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didn't believe in that. Tomorrow wasn't getting ready for them. It didn't even know they were there.” The old man says to the man, “There is no God and we are his prophets.”But the boy believes in and his shaped by his belief in God. They are the good guys who draw the line at barbarity, even when it makes some sense to succumb to it.Recently, in the Chicago area, I wept to read of another suicide, one of an 82 year old man whose wife was in hospice and living with his two aging children, developmentally disabled; the man first murdered the family everyone knew he had deeply loved, then killed himself. (I know, sorry, this is bleak). But no one in their neighborhood or family questioned his love for his family or even his choice. Who can blame this man, facing an inevitably harder end, his friends seemed to say. Not me, the father of two sons, one with severe autism and the other also now diagnosed autistic. I'm 61. What will happen to them when I am gone? Sam, 18, autistic, living during the week in a group home, comes here to my house every other weekend, and so many of the minimum wage folks he works with are caring and loving, but 3-4 years ago we took a young man to trial for pushing him down a flight of stairs, where he was knocked out and his arm badly broken. He can't speak to defend himself. What future does he have, and what future especially without a loving parent to help defend and speak for him? What does his ""road"" hold for him? Sometimes, in my worst moments, and thankfully they are few, I think we are Liam Neeson, in The Grey, facing the wolves of destruction in the Arctic (as Neeson himself did when he lost his wife to a skiing accident, facing his own emotional holocaust and nuclear winter), knife in hand, to the end.I have heard this is McCarthy's most personal novel, and since he is a father, and dedicates the book to his own so John Francis McCarthy, I can guess this maybe this is true. I can imagine it as a letter to him, or to all fathers and sons, to help them face down their own terrible moments with grace and resourcefulness. In this book, the man is handy, he is always problem-solving, fixing what he has with the tools available to him, scavenging, finding food and water, reading and telling stories to his son with lessons he sometimes barely believes himself anymore. Whatever he does, McCarthy tells us the son watches his father, and learns. Without his son, there is only death, and he must to the end teach his son how to be handy, to be resourceful, to go on, to live, the best he can. My own father, the weekend before he died on the operating table for his second bypass surgery, at 76, dropped down to slide under the chassis of my aging Chevy and check out my fading brakes, to the end urging me to care about my stuff, to do the right thing, mentoring me in the right way to live. That night he held one of his last great grandchildren in his arms; less than 48 hours later he was dead, which was still the most devastating moment of my life. Reading the father-son relationship that is at the heart of this book through my own loss makes it tender, gives it depth and rich sentiment. I mean, it is harsh, and bleak, this world the father and son live in, but the story is fundamentally sweet and moving. It's about what matters, as the best of books always are.McCarthy urges me and us to go on, to be resourceful, to care for each other, and to care for the Earth we were given. There are images so terrible in this book that the man tries to shelter from his son, though the son sees them anyway, and we see them, too. Are they useful to see? I surely don't want some of them in my memory, but there they are, reminding me of past genocides and tragedies and prefiguring the ones surely yet to come on personal and global levels. Maybe it's useful to remind me of the ""bad guys"" who the man and boy meet on the road, who make the immoral, the wrong choices. What evil is humanly possible? But also, what good? What do we need to do to save the planet? Do we really want to? How long can we keep our heads in the sand, as humans with the power still to (maybe) reverse the environmental end? McCarthy teaches us how to live, and why it is so important: Because of love, and family, and the beauty of the planet. “Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”--McCarthyCamus suggests that we humans, post WWII--the Holocaust and Hiroshima, and Stalin, all of it- juts push that Myth of Sisyphus-boulder up that hill without any assurance of meaning beyond the doing of it. I can't go on; I'll go on, Samuel Becket has his narrator say at the end of The Unnameable, and that's what the man does and perhaps we should do in the worst of circumstances. McCarthy know his Beckett, but finally, McCarthy is not Beckett, as much as this tale owes to McCarthy's master; McCarthy gives us just a little more dignity and hope than Beckett, I think. I think, too, in my darkest moments that I understand Robin Williams, facing Parkinson's disease, and that 82 year old man, seeing the bleak future for him and his wife and children. I am not and have never yet been suicidal, but I understand their choices. I understand Camus and Beckett on these important subjects. I may have to reread this tale again and again to keep me on the road the man took instead of the one his wife chose. After all, I have sons (and a daughter) to care for. Maybe I'm gonna hug my kids a little bit harder tonight."

Cormac McCarthy follows them closely on their march through barren wastelands, dead forests and decaying towns. The footsteps they leave in the ubiquitous dust are swept away by the cold ashen breath of the grey earth. Whatever gets left behind ceases to exist. The promise is brittle. Hold on to it too tightly, dream of it too violently, and both the promise and the road will turn to dust, leaving you in a desert with nowhere to go.The father and his son know this in their hearts. Yet they go on, together, carrying the fire ever southwards. Every step they take is a rebellion against a world turned cold and dry.On a planet that no longer indulges the luxury of life, the road of stubborn survival only knows one destination. Defiantly, a father and a son, scavengers of canned goods and memories, hold the fire against the indifferent skies and hold on to each other. Ssh. It'll be okay."
6288,1454369914,it was amazing,"Excuse me please while I cover my face with my hands and quietly sob.In a scorched and dangerous post-apocalyptic America, an unnamed father and son scavenge for food, look for shelter and try to avoid bandits and people who’ve resorted to cannibalism. The two, pushing along their rusty cart, travel the road simply because they must. The alternative is death.I admire the fact that there’s no explanation about how the end of the world happened and why certain people survived. There are a couple of flashbacks, but they have to do with human relationships, not some plague, and have a dreamlike quality about them.This is my first Cormac McCarthy, and it took a while to adjust to his writing style. There are no dialogue quotes. Sentences are often verbless. Contractions have no apostrophes. The language is poetic yet not flowery or excessive.Initially, I found the novel painful to read. It was so bleak and unrelenting, and the characters had no goal except survival: finding that next stash of canned goods, locating oil for a lamp, finding blankets to protect them from the cold, making sure their shoes held out.Ultimately, the love between father and son gives the book its heart, and offers up a bit of hope to the reader. The man must, through example, pass on his knowledge and humanity to the boy. But in a way the boy teaches his father just as much. None of this is remotely sentimental.By depicting a barren universe where nothing grows, McCarthy is surely asking us to appreciate the mysterious bounty of the earth.A moving and timeless post-Thanksgiving theme. And an unforgettable book. "
6288,1506899640,really liked it,"This novel is both dismal and poignant. The tale is that of a man and his son, trying to survive on a devastated (possibly post-nuclear) land, covered in ashes. They trudge through on a deserted road that doesn't seem to lead anywhere. They are starving for the most part. From time to time they either find food, or they come up with a group of man-eating panhandlers.Not much of a plot to speak of in this book, and all this seems to be a pointless and painful attempt at surviving in a world that is already charred and dead (in a way, it reminded me of some of Samuel Beckett's plays). There is at all times an undercurrent of danger and threat. Most descriptions are about landscapes or minute details: the man exploring abandoned houses or cobbling rusted things together. Most of the dialogues between the two main characters are about making sure the other one is okay. Cormac McCarthy's narration is extraordinarily subtle and avoids any explanation or judgement.In the end, this might sound quite dull and gloomy indeed, but through it all, and mainly through the relationship between the father and his son, I was startled by the genuinely stirring sense of humanity, of compassion, of love, of hope that arises from this story.Edited to add: I just watched the movie starring Viggo Mortensen. Apart from a few flashbacks with the wife (Charlize Theron), it is respectfully adapted from Cormac McCarthy’s novel. It’s a colourless, dreadful, profoundly wrenching film, in the best tradition of father & son movies such as Chaplin’s The Kid. Mortensen, Robert Duvall and the boy Kodi Smit-McPhee are outstanding.Edit: Watched Netflix's red hot Bird Box with Sandra Bullock. Although it's a rather gripping movie, it's packed with post-apocalyptic clichés we've all seen countless times in other alien-zombie-pandemic-you-name-it disaster movies. John Malkovich, as an old curmudgeon soaker, is the only one who plays his cards right — the music is interesting as well. I haven't read Josh Malerman's novel (feel free to comment if you have), but this is quite obviously a pastiche of McCarthy's story."
6288,1760498454,it was amazing,"The Road is a painful, beautiful, horrifying, heartfelt, and compelling novel about a father and his son that astounded me from its opening pages through to its conclusion. I’ve made known my disparagement for post-apocalyptic stories, which all seem to eventually fall into the same tropes ad museum. You’ve read or watched the stories where one band of survivors tries to survive only to run into another band of survivors who, despite initial appearances, have devolved from society into little more than beasts. The Road is patently not that story.Where much of post-apocalyptic literature sets itself apart by small increments, The Road moves as far away from the mores of the genre as possible. McCarthy’s novel focuses on an unnamed father and son who trudge through what is possibly the bleakest future I have ever read. The world is covered in ash, the sun blotted out, food is so scarce that cannibalism is the norm, and as winter approaches our two leads are placed in immense jeopardy. With this grey, black, and white palate, McCarthy paints a relationship in vivid colour. For this novel is truly a novel of fatherhood, unyielding love, and the lengths we go to for the ones we love. A recurring conversation between the boy and his father is their status as carriers of the fire. While at first it seems like a cheap contrivance, by the novel’s end I was dazed by how they truly do illuminate the novel. The moments shared between father and son demonstrate love overtly and subtly. In the man’s struggle to keep the darker parts of the world from his son despite their ubiquity, the reader comes to know the character of the man. The moments are so many and too well written to be sullied by my meager paraphrasing. Suffice to say that these moments are delivered without artifice, pretense, or falseness. The novel is raw, and it comes through not only from the world or emotion, but also from the writing. My only previous encounter with McCarthy was a good four to five years ago when I attempted to make my way through Blood Meridian. Though it has been a long time between my abandonment of that novel and my reading of The Road, I have to wonder if I was too harsh on the former. McCarthy ignores a great deal of grammar, preferring to eschew commas, quotation marks, and apostrophes for the bare minimum required to convey his idea. Though I normally wouldn’t appreciate this, it was impossible for me not to be drawn in by the poetry in this language which, much like its setting, is stripped of pretense. The Road is a harrowing read, there’s no doubt about it. Though for all its horrors and inhumanity, I came to the novel’s end thinking it to be an ultimately hope-filled novel. What's more, it is a compelling adventure in that it is a story about the struggle to survive. What this novel has is what other post-apocalyptic fiction lacks: heart. Against a tide of incessant desolation stand a man and his son, and their love holds aloft the fire of humanity, the essence upon which our societies are built. I cannot recommend this novel enough, and it will definitely not be my last from McCarthy."

È la grande invenzione di questo romanzo, considerato il suo capolavoro (a torto, secondo me: il suo libro migliore è da cercare tra i meridiani di sangue e la trilogia della frontiera), adattato per lo schermo in un film molto bello che ho visto due volte, e che paga pegno al testo da cui è tratto esclusivamente per il finale, questo sì, superiore sulla pagina. Per un padre chioccia quale io sono, si è trattato di un viaggio lungo poco più di duecento pagine attraverso delizia e atrocità per approdare a un finale che non posso raccontare e quindi nemmeno commentare.Non ero abituato a un Mccarthy così dedito al dialogo, nei suoi libri i personaggi mi sono sempre sembrati tutto meno che loquaci: invece, qui, la chiacchiera abbonda e non è la parte migliore del libro.Quando ce ne saremo andati tutti qui resterà solo la morte, e anche lei avrà i giorni contati.Il bambino ci provava a parlare con Dio, ma la cosa migliore era parlare con il padre, e infatti ci parlava e non lo dimenticava mai."
6288,575702572,it was amazing,"I seem to be the last one on the planet to have read this ""Dystopian Masterpiece"" destined to go down in history as blah blah blah. :) Yeah, it's good. Simple tale told extremely simply. Poetic in places, very realistic in almost all ways, and it was true to human nature, both in the good and in the bad.People are scared. It's how we deal with the fear that makes us good people or average or just plain bad.This is true at all times, of course, not just when the rubber tires on the highway have melted into the pavement. If we deal with the terror with optimism and decency, such as the kid deals with it, we see it as how we would like to be, but how the man deals with it is a lot more realistic, full of self-deception and compromise and desperation.The best part of the novel is in the descriptions, the heavily oppressive setting. I personally thought these two characters were a bit too everyman for extended consumption. Fortunately, this classic is also rather short, so it didn't really bother me that much.Well! Now I can say I've read the classic, even though it's pretty much like all the bookcases of dystopian literature I've already read. :) Nothing groundbreaking, just solid writing and a universal feel.I suppose this is what makes classics, classics."

Stripped Bare
Something awful has happened to the planet. Everything is burned or burning, and ash is a persistent, suffocating blanket. People are nomads, moving from place to place in terror and in desperation to find food and shelter. Houses and towns and cities are abandoned, mostly looted and picked clean. Think ""The Walking Dead"" minus the zombies.This was by far the easiest, quickest read of all dozen or so Pulitzer Prize novels I've read. This is partially due to my emotional investment in the story - I truly cared about ""the man"" and ""the boy"" and their survival - but even more so due to the bareness of the writing. It's the opposite of cluttered. Each word lies naked, unadorned, as though with the apocalypse, flowery adjectives and superfluous verbiage were destroyed as part of the mass carnage.It's true. In this book, there is no room for melodrama. There's no room for purple prose either, though there is definitely poetry hidden in the simple, raw words. There's no room for punctuation: can't or don't inexplicably becomes cant and dont and there are no quotation marks during dialogue. There’s no room for identity, either, as our main characters have no names. No characters have names, actually. And, there's not a great deal of room given to 'plot'. The story is simply a journey that the father and son take along the road, the telling of their mental and physical survival during unbelievable stress and constant danger. It also documents the survival of their humanity, in times where people cross every line imaginable in the name of self preservation. The boy holds dearly to his innate moral compass - they are the ""good guys"", which means there are things they absolutely will not do in order to live. This is what separates them from the ""bad guys"". It is interesting to me that this child, born into a barren, unfriendly world, a child who had never seen a bird or tasted Coke, knows his life, while precious, isn't worth losing his self. The father saves his son time and time again, in the physical sense. But the boy saves his father too, keeping him from shedding the very thing that makes him a good person. And this is both beautiful and painful to see.However bleak this story is, there is hope. In this decapitated, desecrated world, there is still love. Still love, no matter how dark the road."

My fellow bloggers and I have been trying to put together a post about positive father figures in books for Father's Day this year. It's troubling because it has been kind of hard! It almost seems like we need a post just to talk about the LACK of positive father figures in books. Maybe we are just reading the wrong genres? Anyway, shout-out to one of my favorite dads in all of literary history. This guy. What he does for his son, his determination, courage, love... it brought me to the Ugly Cry - and that is a scary place to be (thankfully no one saw me). Okay, that is all.Original post:This book made me ugly cry. What an unexpected emotional roller coaster. This is a book that has mixed reviews, but it was amazing in my view. A very sad story of love and survival filled with poignant moments in all the bleakness.I could never make it in a world like this. I could survive without electricity or having to learn to hunt or grow food, but in a bleak world where animals are extinct and there is nothing but ash, cannibals, and burned soil everywhere? Nope. I'd want to die during the apocalypse and not in the post-apocalypse. I can see that this book would not be for everyone. It's written simply, with no punctuation. Not much happens, really. You don't get any answers as to what originally happened or why. But the sparseness really worked for me in this case. Wow. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time to come. I fear actually watching the movie would cause stomach cramps and eye swelling from all the weeping I would do. I don't know if an apocalypse like this is possible, but it makes you think about how far you would be willing to go to protect those you love. ""The man"" in this story was an amazing person. It also makes you think about how important it is to cherish the moments you have with your loved ones now. We should think more about the world we will leave our children and our grandchildren - about the world they may inherit by tragic accident or willful ignorance.

6288,1736324829,it was amazing,"A few years back, I have watched ""The Road"" on HBO. I actually like the film, and I think it's well crafted. I held back on reading the book for a while since the movie seemed pretty straightforward and powerful enough to convey the story. An opportunity presented itself though, when I got hold of a copy on the last day of The Annual Library Book Sale. Since I can't seem to get enough of dreary stories lately, I have decided to read this one right away.""The Road"" is a novel by an American master. It has all the thrills you'd expect from a post-apocalyptic novel, a fair share of horror and gore, and you'll also encounter an incredibly sweet relationship between a father and son. Reading this can, at times, feel a lot like you are right there with the characters, slogging through a gray, bleak, uncaring landscape that stretches out before you with no hope of rescue. The book has more than its fair share of brutality and despair, but it also has a thin, but powerful, vein of love running through it. In this case, we have a boy's love for his father, and a father's love for his son. It is, for the most part, literally all that keeps them going through unimaginable horrors. As cliched as it might sound, love gets them through it. Love sustains them just like --in a very real way--we are all sustained, sheltered, and ultimately saved by the love in our own livesIf I liked the film, then I must be weak-in-the-knees in love with the novel. I should have read it sooner! The film does evoke the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy's novel. It is powerful but, after reading the book, lacks the same core of emotion the story wants to impart. I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. The novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images. Its effect comes, above all, through McCarthy's prose. His prose has the uncanny ability to convey more than dialogue and incident. It's as dense as poetry! How could a film summon this much power? The movie could only do so much, and is still found wanting. I still like the movie and find it well made, but after this read, I think McCarthy is all but unfilmable."
6288,324188888,it was amazing,"There are some books which literally sweep you of your feet and leave you gasping for breath. As one grows older and the reading palate more jaded, the chance of finding such a book becomes rarer and rarer; so the actual discovery of one is all the more delightful.The Road by Cormac McCarthy is such a book.By all means, the story ought to have been a cliche: it explores the hackneyed dystopic theme of a group of people moving across a blasted landscape. The fact that it turns out to be one of the most powerful reading experiences instead, is due to McCarthy's narrative power, and the story's focus on the father-son bond rather than the horrors of the road.The unnamed protagonists are moving south across an America of the future in search of warmth and food; a land which has been destroyed by a massive cataclysm which is never described. Some kind of deflagration is suggested (maybe nuclear). There are no animals left, and dead and charred trees dot the landscape. The sun is seldom seen, and it rains ash almost constantly. Nightmare people populate this nightmare landscape: cannibals who keep people penned up in basements for meat and roast infants on spits.The strength of the novel is that most of this information is incidental. McCarthy does not dwell on the horrors, but mentions them in passing and moves ahead. The focus is always on the man and the boy, and their stubborn will to survive.The cataclysm has occurred suddenly: the man remembers a time when everything was ""normal"" (in our everyday sense of the word). For the boy, this is ""normal"". Both father and son have adapted to their dismal environment seamlessly. Their lives are reduced to the basics of any living organism: food, shelter and the avoidance of death. As the story unfolds, we find the man slowly moving towards an animalistic state of existence; all vestiges of altruism, of “humanity”, are stripped away. He will do anything to survive, even if he destroys other human beings in the process. The only person he cares about, other than himself, is his son.As the story moves towards its resolution, the mood of quiet desperation mounts uncontrollably, reaching a crescendo on the father's death: however, the author does not let us down. The small flame of hope kept alight throughout the novel is left burning at the end, so that The Road ultimately proves redemptive.There are no chapters in this novel. It is written in short sections, and perfectly parallels the endless procession of nights and days of the journey. The dialogue is staccato, repetitive and Hemingway-esque. I found McCarthy's signature way of writing without punctuation apt for the subject matter. The many dialogues between father and son, mostly consisting of the word “okay” repeated many times (when things are definitely not “okay”-nice bit of tragic irony here) revolve around a single theme: the father assuring the son that they are not going to die, and they will find the “good” people. Instead of being boring, the repeated theme is strangely effective.The man’s sense of nostalgia for a time irrevocably lost and his love for his son comes across with an emotional force which is almost painful. In fact, the child is almost deified. Consider the following passage (which is sheer poetry):In the morning they came up out of the ravine and took to the road again. He’d carved the boy a flute from a piece of roadside cane and he took it from his coat and gave it to him. The boy took it wordlessly. After a while he fell back and after a while the man could hear him playing. A formless music for the age to come. Or perhaps the last music on earth called up from the ashes of its ruin. The man turned and looked back at him. He was lost in concentration. The man thought he seemed some sad and solitary changeling child announcing the arrival of a travelling spectacle in shire and village who does not know that behind him the players have all been carried off by wolves.The boy takes on mythical overtones here (Krishna with his flute or Pan with his pipes): a remnant of a pastoral idyll which has been sadly burnt away. We know instinctively that the child will survive. Because, as the man says in his dying speech, he is the carrier of the fire…You’re going to be okay, Papa. You have to.No I’m not. Keep the gun with you at all times. You need to find good guys but you can’t take any chances. No chances. Do you hear?I want to be with you.You cant.Please.You cant. You have to carry the fire.Is it real? The fire?Yes it is.Where is it? I dont know where it is.Yes you do. It’s inside you. It was always there. I can see it.This is the true Promethean fire, burning forever inside mankind’s heart, even while suffering eternal punishment at the behest of gods. This is the fire which is passed down from generation to generation, igniting the mind of the scientist, the artist, the writer and the revolutionary. As long as one knows one has passed it on, one can die peacefully.This novel is an emotional onslaught which will rip you apart, will shatter your world so that it can never be reassembled together in the same way again (I was in tears by the end). Very highly recommended."
6288,1769117320,it was amazing,"The Road is a moving and terrifying post-apocalyptic novel that deserves its notoriety. The two unnamed characters, a father and a son, set out on a nightmarish, nearly impossible journey. It is hard to stop reading once you start. I felt a bit nauseous at times but as always the spare but beautiful, powerful writing of McCarthy is spellbinding. I definitely understand why this book got a Pulitzer. Now, gotta watch the movie!"
6288,886825453,it was amazing,"Terror. Stark naked, clear as the day and indelible in its intensity. Terror that turns its unflinching gaze on you, commanding you to quake in your boots and disintegrate into pieces. This book is that kind of cold dread that seeps into your blood like insidious venom and drains away your strength in a steady, agonizing trickle as you read along. The horror of being stranded in a world, where the living live on either to become sustenance for other survivors or to hunt and feast on fellow brethren to survive, becomes as real as the morning sunlight pouring in to your room through the gauzy curtains.The trouble with dystopian fiction (literary and otherwise) is that if you have read one book from the genre you have pretty much read them all. And the rather unabashed confession I have to make in this regard is that I have read quite a lot of them - this is the 'guilty pleasure' I am not really guilty of indulging in once in a while. But when the focus of the discussion on dystopias shifts to a universally read book like 'The Road' then opinions range from acerbically negative criticism, a patronizing, reluctant pat on the back to disappointed neutrality and effusive praise. Cormac McCarthy's prose has also garnered less than enthusiastic responses from quite a significant number of reviewers. I suppose some thought his metaphors to be too flowery for their taste. While the rest have found him to be repetitive and dull. Fair enough. But I did not.To bring to life a world, where there's nothing left to do except scrounge around for nourishment, it is obvious the author will be hard pressed to elaborately detail the act of unscrewing a jar top and drinking from it. The monotone adopted while chronicling these trivial actions conveys the chilling truth of how much gravity is being accorded to affairs considered undeserving of even a passing mention in a former way of life.Thus, I refuse to join in the chorus of complaints. The very visceral and undiluted reaction the narrative elicited from me as a reader, caused me to refrain from belittling McCarthy's gift for utilizing the same old genre tropes to offer such insightful commentary on the human condition. And despite its bleak and nihilistic leanings, 'The Road' surprised me with its deft handling of a subject as sensitive as a parent-child relationship, a theme that is often explored in many fictional narratives but with varying degrees of success. More than any tear-inducing gimmickry, the relationship depicted here bears a frighteningly close resemblance to how things are in reality. Our two unnamed vagrants, a listless father-son duo, who move down this seemingly endless road strewn with the debris of a world long gone and the echoes of a way of life no longer preserved, seemed to me to be representatives of a large majority of humans. The father acts as a kind of misery-sponge, enduring the brunt of all the vicissitudes of fate that await them on this cruel and unforgiving peregrination, while shielding the son from the same. And as the toil of this godforsaken journey wears the parent down to the point of no return, the child is familiarized with the brutalities of the world at large and gently shown the ways in which one can side-step all the unpleasantness and maintain an existence without challenging authority in any form. Isn't this what a majority of humans have been seeking to accomplish on an infinite loop? 'Survive and don't ask for trouble in any form.' is the motto etched onto the blank slate of our minds since childhood. All the horrors lying in ambush for this father-son pair, starting from chance encounters with roving bands of cannibals to combating the evident threat of starvation and the bitter cold which freezes them to the bone, can be taken to be allegories of all the challenges of living that individually all of us have to contend with. The metaphorical road is just another minefield where one can never foresee the kind of evils one wrong step may unleash. All the lawless laws, by which the world is governed once the formerly established edifice of order and organization has crumbled to dust, are deeply reminiscent of the relentless cycle of injustices institutionalized by our so-called 'civilization'. Just as the weak are preyed upon and devoured alive in this dystopia, the downtrodden and oppressed are victims of a sort of economic cannibalism enshrined in the 'laws' of our reality. The scales are tipped ever in the favor of those who wield power in some form; in this dystopia it is the possession of a weapon, in ours it is the ownership of wealth. 
""The last instance of a thing takes the class with it. Turns out the light and is gone. Look around you. Ever is a long time. But the boy knew what he knew. That ever is no time at all.""
It disturbs me how near invisible the line of separation between an imagined dystopia and a real one is."
6288,2695125407,really liked it,"To say this is a grim read is an understatement. Cormac McCarthy's The Road stands out for its stark sense of desolation and desperation. This bleakness is oppressive even for the reader who feels pinned down on the road, hope suffocating with every page turned. In the story, winter pushes a man and his young son to take to the road where they must fend off starvation and roving militia bands. Undoubtedly, McCarthy's spare language--it is always the man and the boy, for instance--contributes to this feeling of hopelessness. While this bare-bones approach gives the novel a certain power, in my opinion it takes something away too. Is this a novel I can recommend? Absolutely. However, while the atmosphere produced is unequal, I prefer dystopian novels that give me more to think about. "

6288,10333780,it was ok,"I wrestled with a final rating for this. ""The Road"" definitely has merit. The style is purposefully minimalist. As others have noted there are very few apostrophe's, no commas, no quotation marks. The font is dull. The paragraphs carry extra spacing. The words are clipped. This all works very well for setting the atmosphere.As others have offered it is also not the job of the author to explain away all questions. Leaving a sense of mystery can be very good for a story. We should expect that in the end there should be some questions left unanswered. We should expect this all the more when the story is written in a third person form that has a nearly claustrophobic attachment to the characters perspective.However, we should always expect the story to make sense based on what we know of how the world works. The setting is not just furniture. This is true in all settings, even fantasy and science fiction. In Tolkien's world dragons may breath fire but apples still fall down. As the setting becomes grittier we should expect the rules to be tighter and more menacing.Unfortunately, rules don't apply in ""The Road"". We are presented with an apocalyptic world where every meal counts and where people have turned to cannibalism to survive. And here we are presented with our first problem. Cannibalism as a survival technique isn't very efficient. Eating people that are emaciated by hunger doesn't result in a good transfer of calories. Yet the book strongly implies that the cannibalistic cults have been active for years.Also odd is that they have avoided the bodies. The father and son are constantly coming across corpses. Some of them still smell. More than a few are mummified. Why not boil those down, since they seem to be plentiful, before having to chase and hunt humans ""on the hoof""? It isn't that this makes the cults suicidal and stupid, the problem is that there is no reason for them still existing.There are other logical inconstancies. The father and son eat dried apples from a field in a world were clouds, rain, and snow seem to be constant. How exactly are they dry? The sun can't dry them out and neither can the heat. All of that is gone.Nothing grows except one instance of fungus. If everything is dead, except the humans, where did the fungus come from? If fungus survived, why not moss? After all of this time why isn't life coming back? Even Chernobyl is virtual a parkland now. There appears to be no radiation in this world yet nothing lives, why? There are fires being set by the cults yet houses, and the author spends some time describing what is wooden frame construction sitting next to the burnt out houses, still stand. Fires are also being set to what, charcoal? The author doesn't have to explain all of these things, but he does have to be consistent.Since humans, lumbering giants at the tip of the food pyramid, survived he has to show what happened to the mice. And no, canned food doesn't count. Even a survivalist will only pack enough for his family for six months to a few years. The book implies that the son was born at the time of the disaster and he's old enough now to hold a conversation and be useful which implies that he's at least four years old. Why isn't the food all gone? Given that nothing lives, why not avoid the calorie expenditure and sit on any store of food you find rather than tromping through freezing weather to find the shore. Most critical of all, if there is a reason, why not impart this reason to your son?Since the book never answers these questions it has to rely on style, which is done well, and a questionable emotional appeal. It is, in many ways, the worst of modern decadence. It expects us to not ask any important questions about the setting and instead feel for the horrors that the characters face. It is a very subtle and powerful form of emotional blackmail. It teaches us to be less than human, to fear and not to think about what we fear."
6288,696860605,it was amazing,"There are very few authors whose entire works I've personally sought out. Cormac McCarthy is one such gem. One of the world's greatest living writers, his skill is something to behold. His books are dark, understated, well-crafted, and void of the bullshit that stinks up the work of so many other writers. Cormac is compelling through and through, regardless of what story he is telling. It should be said that McCarthy isn’t the easiest author to read sometimes. He’s an immeasurable talent who plays by his own rules of writing, breaking countless others as he does his thing. But ‘The Road’ is arguably his most accessible work, and a hell of a piece of speculative fiction. The prose is minimal and frighteningly effective, weaving a bleak world with all the right words and perfect pacing. It’s so sparse and fluid; yet holds surprising warmth in a world created out of coldness and indifference. It’s mastery more easily digestible than some of his prior works.*This book was one of my selections in my '5 Books That Made Me A Better Writer' piece.

6288,2305800671,it was amazing,"""La raza humana está destinada a internarse más y más en la noche de los tiempos primitivos, hasta que vuelva a empezar su sangrante marcha hacia la nueva civilización."" Jack London, La peste escarlataCómo hacer para reseñar un libro como ""La carretera""... Hice un repaso por los distintos títulos de los libros que llevo leídos en tantos años y me cuesta mucho recordar uno que acarree tanto sufrimiento como éste.Tal vez algún pasaje en las novelas de Dostoievski, como el final de ""Humillados y ofendidos"", pero no hay ningún libro que se le parezca y me atrevería a decir ni que se le acerque.La historia que nos cuenta Cormac McCarthy es pura desolación, sufrimiento, miseria, hambre, frío y tristeza. Es angustiante, descorazonador, lúgubre y toda la travesía de este hombre con su hijo es un fiel retrato del amor incondicional de un padre ante la adversidad más dolorosa.Las pocas ocasiones en que se topan con algo relativamente bueno, es decir, un poco de comida y cobijo, son efímeras. No pueden quedarse ni les alcanza. Deben seguir avanzando por una interminable carretera rodeada de parajes yermos y barridos por lo que parecen los resabios de una hecatombe nuclear (el autor nunca nos revela qué fue lo que pasó realmente), poblada de cadáveres y de edificios en ruinas.Da la sensación de que ambos vienen caminando desde hace meses sin rumbo fijo, guiados por las pocas hojas de un mapa sucio y rotoso, pero con la idea de llegar al mar, a la costa.Este libro tiene un antecesor, que fue escrito por Jack London exactamente 96 años antes y que se llamó ""La peste escarlata"", en el que la humanidad, devastada por una plaga letal queda reducida a unos pocos seres humanos en todo el mundo. En ese libro también un hombre, pero mucho más anciano, camina de la misma manera que los personajes de esta novela las rutas ferroviarias junto a su nieto y dos niños más, tratando de explicarles por qué han terminado en esa situación, mientras deben cuidarse de no ser atacados por ""merodeadores"", gente casi caníbal, reducidos a un estado salvaje y primitivo.El hombre y el niño de ""La carretera"" no están exentos de estos peligros. Se han vuelto desconfiados ante las pocas personas con las que se cruzan, tal es el caso del viejo y tratan de no permanecer mucho tiempo en los lugares ni encender fuegos que los delaten. Viven en una constante huida, mirando a sus espaldas, durmiendo de a ratos, calados por el frío atroz, el hambre extremo y unas condiciones climáticas totalmente adversas en donde la nieve, el viento y la lluvia son su azotes principales, ya que como perros de presa los persiguen y acucian y les horadan la moral y el temple.Son sobrevivientes, aunque al hijo le cueste mucho entender el término. A duras penas se arrastran por un país en ruinas. El hambre y el frío es lo único que conocen. Algunos pasajes son verdaderamente emotivos, con altas dosis de sufrimiento y penuria. Es muy difícil sobrellevar la historia sin ponerse un momento en los zapatos de estos personajes.Con una descripción muy detallada del entorno en el que los personajes se encuentran y con una economía de diálogos suficiente para darnos a entender que extremas situaciones están atravesando, McCarthy logra un efecto de atención total en el lector.No hay necesidad por parte del autor de ahondar en ni en conversaciones profundas ni en disertaciones filosóficas. Todo lo dialogado es rápido, directo y sin rodeos.El sólo hecho de pensar que esto podría suceder algún día nos hace reflexionar de que el ser humano no es eterno sino todo lo contrario: es pequeño, endeble, débil y fácilmente extinguible. Sólo basta que algún dictador trastornado aprete el botón equivocado para que este hermoso planeta quede reducido a cenizas como el de ""La carretera"".Para aquellos que hayan visto la película protagonizada por Viggo Mortensen, puedo decirles que es imposible no asociar al actor mientras uno lee el libro y creo que esto no es algo negativo, sino que realza a enfocarse más en la historia. Los personajes adquieren cierta identidad, tienen una ""cara"" que uno reconoce de la película que para variar respeta fielmente el argumento del libro. Diría que más dura aún y a la vez emocionante con un final no apto para aquellos de lágrima fácil.Como escribí al comienzo, no leí nunca una historia similar a la de ""La carretera"". Seguramente habrá algún libro que describe lo que en este se nos cuenta. Si algún lector puede trazar una comparación con otro libro, me gustaría saberlo para poder leerlo.Soy un lector, pero ante todo un ser humano. Como padre no quisiera imaginarme el hecho de estar en la misma situación que describe McCarthy en esta historia.El padre, más allá del precario estado de salud en que se encuentra, no flaquea ni muestra debilidad ante su hijo, sino que siempre intenta transmitirle la fortaleza y espíritu que tanto cuerpo y alma van perdiendo para dejar bien en alto la manera en la que amor filial debe sostenerse para no sucumbir ante tanto sufrimiento.Este es el efecto maravilloso que produce en nosotros la literatura. En muchas ocasiones, la ficción es capaz de irrumpir en la realidad para hacernos reflexionar y decir ¡qué fuertes somos, qué frágiles somos!"
6288,1055493239,really liked it,"Gray, dark, cold. Ash. Make yourself comfortable with these words. This is what remains of our world in ""The Road"", Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic vision set in the not so inconceivable future. At some point the reader might feel McCarthy's constant reiteration on an earth laid waste, the gray clouds and the blackened dead trees and the abandoned homes scavenged bare, is monotonous. But that's the point.This is not a pocket of America. The destruction is complete. Civilizations and order are but a memory, a distant memory. Surviving the scene are a father and son traveling south in order to escape another winter. They follow a tattered map and stick to a road where the charred and melted dead litter the streets and roadside bandits await to kill and eat. (If the world is a dangerous place now, McCarthy is hell on earth.) What makes the nameless father and son remarkable is not their ability to scavenge for food and avoid murderers and thieves in an earth pillaged bare. It is their commitment to goodness where goodness is nowhere to be seen.In this case it is the son, a young boy, who holds firm to the belief his father ingrained in his mind. They are, as the father says, ""carrying the fire"" in a world darker than dark. The boy is the father's conscience and ours, and he pleads the case for morality in a place where, it can be argued, morality no longer has residency. Is he simply naïve? No. Affected? Yes, he weeps for the world, but he's also impervious to the world's selfish corruption.McCarthy's prose is, once again, poetic and beautifully written. He keeps true to the story and ends on note both sad and hopefully uplifting. ""The Road"" is a powerful tale of survival. A survival of the noble qualities in human nature: benevolence, forgiveness and love. It serves as a reminder that though evil may flourish and, ultimately, destroy, goodness will find a way to carry on."

“On this road there are no godspoke men. They are gone and I am left and they have taken with them the world.”
This is another one of those “100 books you should read before you go to that big ol’ malt shop in the sky” that I attempt to read a couple of every year. For whatever reason there was a huge waiting list at the library and when it finally became my turn to ease on down The Road I discovered Jeff and The Hufflepuff were getting ready for a buddy read. Me being me, I immediately invited myself to join their party, but Jeff was all like . . . 
Luckily I’m super strong (or he’s super weak – tomato/tomahto) so I was able to elbow my way right in to the cool kids table. Then I couldn’t stop myself from reading this book in like two hours and proved once again why no one should ever want to buddy up with me. I have a shame : (The one perk of reading with me is you get Mitchell’s input when it comes to reviews. Jeff has already had the “full Mitchell experience” (if you know what I’m sayin’ *wink wink*) so he allowed Ashley temporary custody this go around – leaving me with Harvey Dent (get it, Two Face? because his face is in two different parts? Ha! I kill me!!!) as this review’s co-host . . . 
What better friend to read a book about a lonely trek down a road through a deserted wasteland than a dude who looks like he might have been found on the side of the road in a deserted wasteland, right?You’re probably beginning to wonder when I’m finally going to start talking about this book, huh? There’s not really much I can say. The Road is a love it or hate it kind of story. Obviously from my rating I fall into the love it category, but I can completely understand how it falls short for many. The setting is . . . well, the road – duh – that extends through a desolate post-apocalyptic 'Murica, but you don’t know how the world got to be that way. Tiny Easter Eggs are left to inform you that the story takes place in the near future, but again no definitive answer. The characters are minimally developed – I’m talking they don’t even have names. The writing is sparse, the situation bleak. And the road? As The Beatles once said, it’s long and winding . . . .
I sat down thinking I would read 50 pages and stop in order to stay on track with my buddies. I had no idea I wouldn’t be able to put this book down. I was drawn in immediately and couldn’t leave the world of the man and the boy until I turned the last page. I’m fairly certain I lost a couple of pounds from all the virtual walking too, so BONUS! As I said, this is not a book for everyone – but if you’re looking to add to your Pulitzer Prize winners list or want your friends to believe that you are a super genius while they are reading crap, The Road is short and easy to get through. And if you have a phobia of quotation marks? McCarthy’s books might be the only books written especially for you : )If you really want to be a cheater, apparently this is a movie too – but Viggo Mortensen like this . . . 
equals ewww. I prefer this . . . 
thank you very much."
6288,1891828050,it was amazing,"In the beginning there was THE BOOK. Later came THE MOVIE. But some people watch the movie first and this time I found myself among them. The movie was good enough – sad, post-apocalyptic and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth, the kind of taste that you get when a story has both a happy and a sad ending. This isn’t a spoiler. After you start reading you come to realise quite quickly that in a world built like this one is there’s no place for sunshine. The book was... impressive, as only avalanches and tsunamis and human tragedies can be. There wasn’t much of a plot – in a post-apocalyptic America, a father and a son try to reach the coast, hoping they’ll find... something, anything to help them survive. But you don’t really feel the need for a complicated plot. If you want something full of action this ISN’T the book for you. There aren’t zombies or crazy fights or anything of sorts. On the contrary, The Road relies heavily on description and the prose is almost lyrical. And the weird thing is, I’m not someone who usually enjoys this kind of writing, BUT I LOVED IT HERE. More than anything else, ’The Road’ it’s a heart-wrenching story about love, sacrifice and family. And it’s not a book for everybody. You have to be patient and understand that the beauty of it is in the details and in that amazing father-son relationship. It’s all about the characters and the world building."
6288,1306038379,really liked it,"English review at the bottom
""En esta carretera no hay interlocutores de Dios. Se han ido y me han dejado aquí sólo y se han llevado consigo el mundo""
¿Hay algo que quede cuando el sol se ha apagado? ¿Esperanza cuando todo se ha ido a la mierda? ¿Existe algo por lo que luchar? Uno de los mundos más deprimentes que he visto y una atmósfera de completa desolación es lo que McCarthy presenta en este libro. Este mundo es desolador, no puede ser cambiado pero ha cambiado a todos los que lo habitan. El autor se vale de una serie de recursos para hacerlo sentir de esa manera tales como pocos [y cortos] diálogos y párrafos creados por varias frases más que por una narración continúa, además del desarrollo de los personajes, especialmente de ""el niño"", es entendible y doloroso, pero ellos mismo hacen que la desolación sea mayor al presentarse como desconocidos, personas anónimas cuyo categoría es la única representación de lo que son: ya no son seres humanos, sólo una especie más de distinta edad, pasando esto no sólo con los protagonistas, sino con todos los habitantes de este mundo: La naturaleza de los hombres se aleja de la humanidad y se vuelve simplemente cruda, el instinto es más necesario que la piedad.
""Donde los hombres no pueden vivir a los dioses no les va mucho mejor""
Todo el libro se desarrolla de manera lineal, en ocasiones repetitiva, debido a que son sólo dos personajes durante casi toda la historia, pero las variaciones que se fueron integrantes, Ely, son excelentes, si bien no te habla más del mundo si te hace entender a sus habitantes...y pensar ""Sí yo estuviera en esa situación ¿sería de los buenos?"". 
""Tiempo prestado y mundo prestado y ojos prestados con que llorarlo""
¿Lo recomendaría? Si, pero se que a muchas personas puede no gustarles, consta principalmente de descripciones y tiene un ritmo muy mesurado, inclusive los momentos más intensos carecen de rapidez (que no de tensión) y es fácil que te aburra si esperas que todo, o la mayor parte, del tiempo estén batallando con los peligros del lugar (cosa que no sucede), además de que mucho tiene que ver con la interacción de ""el hombre"" y ""el niño"", algunos recuerdos y lo árido del paisaje.
""Los días se sucedían penosamente sin cuenta ni calendario""

“On this road there are no godspoke men. They are gone and I am left and they have taken with them the world.
Is there anything left when the sun has gone out? Hope when everything has gone to shit? Is there anything to fight for? This book presents us one of the most depressing worlds I have ever seen and the atmosphere of desolation that McCarthy managed to create is impressive.This world is bleak, canot be changed but has changed all who habit it. The author uses a series of resources to make it feel that way, such as few [and short] dialogues and paragraphs created by several sentences rather than a continuous narrative, in addition, to the development of the characters, especially ""the child"" is understandable and painful, but they themselves make the desolation greater when presenting as unknown, anonymous people whose category is the only representation of what they are: they're no longer human beings, just another species of different age, this happen not only with the protagonists, but with all the inhabitants of this world: The nature of men moves away from humanity and becomes simply raw, instinct is more necessary than piety.
""“Where men can't live gods fare no better.”
The whole book is developed in a linear way, sometimes repetitive, because they are only two characters for most of story, but the significant variations, Ely, are excellent, even when they not speak about the world they make you empathize with their inhabitants ... and think ""If I were in that situation would it be good?"".
“Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it""
Would you recommend it? Yes, but I know that many people may not like, mainly it consists of descriptions and has a very measured pace, even the most intense moments lack of speed (not voltage) and is easy to get bored if you expect that all, or most of the time, they're struggling with the dangers of the place (which doesn't happen), a lot has to do with the interaction of ""the man"" and ""the boy"", some memories and arid landscape.

6288,9672097,liked it,"The Road is a literary mash up composed of equal parts William Faulkner, Raymond Carver, Samuel Beckett, and pulp sci-fi. This sounds great on paper but works only about 50% of the time. For the first 25-30 pages of The Road my BS detector rang like a fire alarm. It soon quieted down, but ultimately the things I disliked about the book—it’s egregiously overwritten in places and some of McCarthy’s more “experimental” techniques seem arbitrary --kept me from fully appreciating its virtues. It took James Woods’ definitive review in The New Republic to help me see what there is to like about it. Wood praises The Road for: the way the McCarthy taps into a post 9/11 fear of apocalypse; his combination of an ornate lyricism a’la William Faulkner with the deadpan minimalism of Raymond Carver; and for McCarthy's rigorous attempt to imagine what a post-apocalyptic world would look and feel like. The Road doesn't extrapolate a dystopian future from some present fear or potential calamity. Rather it plops its characters down in a world engulfed by some kind of nuclear winter (the cause of the catastrophe is never specified) and obsessively imagines what that world would look and feel like.Despite these virtues, there’s just something about the way The Road is executed that puts me off. Critics praise McCarthy for his linguistic inventiveness, and there are some beautiful passages in The Road, but the writing often struck me as showy rather than inventive. I mean, what’s so “inventive” about the arbitrary splicing together of two words? How much linguistic creativity does it take to call a cash register a cashregister, or a pump organ a pumporgan. Such devices occur frequently enough to annoy but not often enough to add much to the musicality of the prose. Then there’s the frequent use of antiquated words: gryke, discalced, scribing, laved, etc. There’s nothing wrong with this in principle—writers should make maximum use of the linguistic resources available to them. A generous interpretation of this tic would be that it adds to the sense of inhabiting a time that’s spiritually detached from the present, or makes the point that the future involves regression rather than progress. But it struck me as showy and gratuitous--a kind of screw you to 21st century sub-literates.The other thing that bugged me was the frequent dropping of profundity bombs—brief portentous statements tacked onto the end of a paragraph that hint at philosophical or religious themes. Two problems with these: First, they are almost always duds; they are never developed and rarely explode into meaning. Second, they often come wrapped in convoluted syntax that I suspect obscures their banality. So, in this case, is McCarthy tweaking the language to make the banal sound profound?Despite these misgivings I liked the book and found it hard to put down. When McCarthy stays in his minimalist register the writing is quite good. He definitely creates a mood, and many of the word-pictures he paints, especially when describing landscapes or the objects necessary to the two main characters’ survival, are quite beautiful. And I do have to give him props, as Wood notes, for advancing the post-apocalypse sub-genre by creating a remorselessly unedifying world in which our present concerns have almost completely faded from memory. Most of the dialogue in The Road is banal in the extreme, and the characters are almost completely without inner lives. But give McCarthy credit for credibly representing the psychological reality of a world in which the things that support inner lives—history, culture, community, an unacknowledged but ever present sense that humanity will extend into the indefinite future—have all but disappeared. McCarthy doesn’t tell us how to avoid the apocalypse, but he gives us a pretty good sense of how we’ll be spending our days when it comes."
6288,266380181,it was amazing,"Everyone warned me it was depressing, but I read it anyway. I read it anyway because each and every one of those people also said The Road was really great. They were right. With masterstrokes of economic elegance, McCarthy colors his spartan, post-apocalyptic landscape, bringing a barren world to life in all its misery. The characters are developed only as deeply as necessary, showing admirable restraint by the author. Yet even with the barest of bare essentials a character could possess (they don't even have names!), I still found myself pulling for them in a way I seldom do. The Road is a compact, tightly-wound novel that truly deserves the praise it has received."
6288,1552354589,really liked it,"The Road is such a visually powerful but slow methodical reading experience. The story is simple but the words pack a punch, it's about survival in this bleak desolate post apocalyptic world, about a man who is trying desperately to keep his son alive and protect him against the elements and the frightening prospects of encountering barbarian bad guys. The setting is grim from the start and it just gets more and more grimmer with impending doom descending onto the pages until you want some kind of relief.... and then that ending! So very sad and sombre but beautifully written but also made me feel uncomfortable at times, a wonderful reading experience but not a feel good book by any means."
6288,1702587868,really liked it,Gorgeously written. Evocative and powerful. The atmosphere is bleak and depressing but so immersive. I definitely teared up a bit at the end. 
6288,1243691912,it was amazing,"Set in a post apocalypse, post extinction event world – this is the story of a man and his boy, a Father and his son and their attempt to make their way through a destroyed and devastated world. This is a book about fear, death and utter devastation in every sense; it’s about a very real struggle for survival and about the sometimes shocking cruelty of life, the world and its inhabitants. Ultimately however it’s the story of life, hope and kindness; it’s about the human spirit and the quest for survival. Despite and in spite of the devastated world in which this is depicted, it is a story about hope and about living in the ‘here and now’ and ultimately redemption. Everything about this novel is great, the prose, the dialogue between Father and son (so simple, so very touching and affecting) the feel of authenticity and the creation of a world, of a story that will stay with the reader for a very long time.‘The Road’ is a monumental, powerful, profound, moving, compelling, engaging, original and great novel – one that is hard to put down and one that I didn’t want to end.Just a quick word on the film adaptation – this is a very good film which is largely faithful to the book, well-acted and directed - however it does lack the same sense of emotional intensity as the novel, and it also either omits or down plays one or two key (more shocking scenes). Worth watching but the novel is in a different league altogether. Don’t miss reading this book – highly highly recommended."
6288,34737864,did not like it,"As a writer I'm a harsh critic (and participate in critique groups where the intention is to make a book better by pointing out its flaws) so I don't leave many reviews as they will tend to have a negative slant.When I see a negative review of my own books they sometimes start out with a comment such as... ""I don't normally write a bad review but this book is just so horrific that I had to balance all the good reviews. I fully realize that I'm in the VAST minority about my opinons on The Road...and as a writer I probably shouldn't speak out so strongly on something that others love. But I am moved so strongly by the Road that I will indeed make an exception for this one book.Now while I'm often critical, I generally don't hate a book and I'm fully aware of the differences in subjective tastes and that what really apeals to one person is exactly what another person hates. I get that. But I'd like to take a moment to share my experience with ""The Road.""I came across it when I was joining a face2face club. As part of signing up they asked which book I disliked the most - and I had no answer. But that soon changed. The monthly read for that particular club was indeed the Road and as I was going to the first meeting I didn't have a chance to read the book. Someone there offered me their copy and I thanked Sue and told her I would return it the next week. ""No,"" she said. ""I don't want this book in my house. You can keep it or burn it...your choice."" I thought that was a strange comment...until I read the book.Having heard the buzz about this book and having seen the plethora of positive reviews, I felt compelled to write my own if only to be that voice of reason in a wilderness of pretentious insanity. Cormac’s McCarthy’s The Road, I can honestly say, is the worst book I have ever read. I am stunned to find such a critical following for a novel that is so clearly bad that I have yet to meet a flesh and blood person who does not hate it, or cannot, even after the most mild inquires, explain its appeal beyond the latent thought that they “ought” to like it. To do otherwise would mark them as uncultured and ignorant. Modern art had Duchamp's toilet, and now literature has its own case of the emperor’s new clothes in, The Road. What sets this novel apart from all others in its genre of ill-conception, is the totality of its failure. There is nothing good that can be said of it. Some virtue can be found in every book, as in the old adage—“…but she has a nice personality.” The Road breaks this rule, and soundly. From the plot and characters to the writing style and even the cover design, the book is abysmally uninspired and a black hole of skill. Much has been made of the writing quality. Alan Cheuse, of the Chicago Tribune, and book commentator for NPR calls it “…his huge gift for language.” Let’s look at that for a moment. It is universally accepted that the first few sentences of any novel are the most crucial—the words which a writer labors over the most to get them just right. Here are the first two sentences of The Road: “When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he’d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before.” I once presented these two sentences to an amateur writer’s forum and asked their opinion. Several members politely replied that the sentences were badly in need of work. Not only were they not grammatically correct, but they were awkward, confusing, used several unnecessary words and had all the rhythm and pacing of a dog with four broken legs. Nights dark beyond darkness, has got to rank up there with, it was a dark and stormy night. This is not at all an isolated example. It is merely the beginning—literally. Other laudable narrative sentences include: “The Hour.” “Of a sudden he seemed to wilt even further.” “A lake down there.” Lest you think I am selectively picking the worst, here is the passage Mr. Cheuse used in his own review as an example of genius: “tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings. An old chronicle. To seek out the upright. No fall but preceded by a declination. He took great marching steps into the nothingness, counting them against his return.” What McCormac is describing here is that it is dark and the man can’t see where he is going. The author is clearly a master of communication. Let’s also pause to consider his brilliance of dialog, and his mastery of the monosyllable conversation that make the screenplay dialog of Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger on par with Shakespeare. Nearly every conversation has the word “Okay,” which appears so often I began to think it was a pun, like a ventriloquist routine. One might conclude McCarthy is attempting to reflect a realistic vernacular into his work, except that the conversations are so stilted and robotic, as to lack even the faintest aroma of realism. There is no slang, no halted speech, no rambling. It is Dragnet. First dialog in the book: Can I ask you something? Yes. Of course. Are we going to die? Sometime. Not now. And we’re still going south. Yes. So we’ll be warm. Yes. Okay. Okay what? Nothing. Just okay. Go to sleep. Okay. You’ll note that I did not use quotes in the above excerpt. That is because neither does McCarthy. There are no quotes anywhere in the book, nor are there any tags designating the speaker, which manages to successfully make determining who is speaking quite a dilemma at times. Moreover, McCarthy never provides names to his characters this forces him to use the pronoun “he” frequently which very often leaves the reader bewildered as to whether he is referring to the father or the boy. McCarthy doesn’t stop with quotes. He rarely uses commas or apostrophes. It doesn’t appear as if he is against contractions as he uses the non-word, “dont” quite frequently. Nor is he making the statement that he can write a whole book without punctuation as he does, on rare occasions, use a comma or an apostrophe, (as you can see from the dialog segment I listed above,) as if he is going senile and merely forgot. As the lack of most of the necessary punctuation’s only result is to make it harder to read, I can only conclude that McCarthy, or his editor are the most lazy people I’ve ever heard of—although I am certain no credible editor ever saw this book. If they had I am certain we would have heard about the suicide in the papers. One might overlook the shortcomings of writing skill if the novel’s foundation was an excellent story. Sadly, this is not the case. Not that it lacks an excellent plot—it lacks a plot. Often times writers anguish over distilling the plot of a novel into a few sentences that might fit on the back of a book cover. It is often impossible to clearly convey all that a book is in such a short span. The Road does not suffer this. Instead I would imagine that if it were possible to put this book in a microwave and evaporate all the extraneous words all you would have left is one sentence: A boy and his father travel south in a post-apocalyptic United States, then the father dies. I wonder if the blurb writer for the, The Road, realized he was also providing a spoiler for the novel so comprehensive, no one need read the book. What the book lacks in plot it clearly makes up for in even less characterization. The father and the boy—that is about as much characterization as you will get. McCarthy doesn’t even provide names from which readers might glean some associative characteristics. We know the boy is afraid, because he says so approximately every four pages, always with the same robotic level of emotional intensity, backing it up with his many reasons, regrets and concerns as in the passage: I am scared. Likewise, the father is equally a pot bubbling over with emotional angst and frustration so vividly expressed in his response: I know. I’m sorry. We might as well burn all our copies of Grapes of Wrath now that we have this tour de force. As amazing as it is, with only an eggshell of plot, McCarthy manages to run afoul of logic. The boy and his father come across shelters packed with food and water, and yet the father insists they move on. Why? Because they must keep moving so as to avoid encountering others. Clearly staying in one place is the best plan to avoid meeting others, hermit do it all the time. Yes, other people might wander into you, but you double that equation if you too are roaming. The only argument for pressing on with the journey is to find others. I am certain I am being too kind here, but given that this is a Pulitzer Prize winning, Oprah Pick, National Bestseller, I don’t want to ruffle too many feathers. Of course, Duchamp's toilet (Fountain) was once voted ""the most influential modern artwork of all time""."
6288,2684995143,it was amazing,"Cormac McCarthy has a simple formula for most of his novels. He begins by creating a relationship of heartwarming innocence and his genius is being able to create a protective love for his characters so quickly and effectively. Then he leads his characters out into a world of malevolent danger. This malevolent danger reaches its apotheosis in the dystopian world he creates in this novel where any stranger encountered is likely to be a murderous cannibal because we're in a world where the food chain has ceased to exist. This is the story of a father whose sole remaining purpose in life is to keep his young son alive. The sun never appears, all vegetation is dead, there are no birds, no insects even. The father's only plan is to get to the sea. We never learn his name. He is ""he"" throughout and he rarely gives himself up to introspection. We don't learn how the earth was all but destroyed; we simply see the effects of the climate catastrophe. Most of what we learn about the former life of the father and son is achieved through brilliant simple dialogue. The novel is simple in its dynamic - we're kept on constant tenterhooks about the safety of the father and son. There are perhaps only two moods in the entire novel - the intimacy shared by two people who love each other and the ubiquitous threats to this love. The big surprise is how much life affirming beauty McCarthy manages to extract from this bleak futuristic vision. I'd already seen the film of this and it was pants compared to the book so don't be put off if you saw the film. This is a stunning novel! "

You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”In “The Road” by Cormac McCarthy"
6288,1336801189,it was amazing,"Wow. This book is like all my worst nightmares rolled into one horrifying ultra-nightmare.'The Road' is one of the most harrowing, gut-wrenching, tragic books I have ever read... and I loved every damned minute of it!This story was incredibly powerful and only made moreso by the knowledge that this could easily be our future. It isn't ever explicitly stated what the apocalyptic event was but, from the hints McCarthy drops here and there, I think it was probably a series of strikes by large meteors. This would cause global forest fires like those described in the book, enormous tsunamis (the beached ship could be evidence of this) and an 'impact winter' where the dust kicked up by the meteor impacts would block out the sun for several years. The only other comparable event would be a nuclear war but I ruled that out as radiation is never mentioned or referenced anywhere in the book.Ultimately, it doesn't really matter what caused the post-apocalyptic scenario the characters in this book are living in, as the point of the story is to depict the deeply personal story of a father desperately trying to scrape some kind of life for his son out of the nightmare world the child was born into. While fathers with young sons may find this especially resonant, anybody who has ever loved anybody can't help but empathise with their plight.I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind having some pretty awful nightmares."
6288,1364763938,really liked it,"Hauntingly realistic post apocalyptic story of survival and love between a father and son. Pulitzer Prize winning, long on description, short on punctuation. A world stripped past the point of basics. For me, the story implies that the son is humanity's last chance. Some of my favourite quotes from the book: father about son; ""If he is not the word of God. God never spoke."" father to son: ""My job is to take care of you. I was appointed to do that by God. I will kill anyone who touches you."" Father to son, son's reply: ""You're not the one who has to worry about everything."" He looked up, his wet and grimy face. ""Yes I am. I am the one."" The ending left me wanting more but it was a good ending, sad but hopeful. In a time when hope is almost nonexistent. A few parts of this story were instantly gratifying for me as I read them. Other parts were horrific and disturbing. Only after a time of contemplation did I realize that it had to be that way. As I've said, It's a realistic story. "

6288,281830686,it was amazing,"Utterly dark and exceptionally sad, suspenseful and gorgeous in its words, this book was recently chosen by one of my reading groups for semi-real time discussion. It is a testament to how much I care about those people that I read this book for the second time.Some things are too somber to revisit, despite their beauty. But I did.McCarthy's youngest child was born when the writer was far older than the average dad, and he began wondering one day what his son's life would be like. War and natural disasters were in the news. What would he do to give his child a chance, even in the darkest of times?If you are one of the few folks to have neither read or seen the movie, the essence is this: a man and his young son travel on foot along the road to the south and to the sea. They journey relentlessly through an ash filled world devoid of living plants, animal life, or bird song and encounter violent people desperate to eat anything. The cold of winter is beginning to bear down on the walkers, and they risk capture every time they spy an abandoned house or gas station because like any other survivors, they are compelled to go have a look. Canned food, blankets, and first aid kits can sometimes be found but they have to walk amongst the dried and mummified corpses shrunken into their beds.Nuclear war? Meteor impact? Eruptions? I am not sure what the initial cause of the apocalypse is as the clues don't add up properly, but I've got a good guess. Regardless, death outweighs life by massive margins. Even remembered death of those the man had never known...""At night when he woke coughing, he'd sit up with his hand pushed over his head against the blackness. Like a man waking in a grave. Like those disinterred dead from his childhood that had been relocated to accommodate a highway. Many had died in a cholera epidemic and they'd been buried in haste in wooden boxes and the boxes were rotting and falling open. The dead came to light lying on their sides with their legs drawn up and some lay on their stomachs. The dull green antique coppers spilled from out the tills of their eyesockets onto the stained and rotted coffin floors.""The metaphors and word use are achingly beautiful in this story but reading all of them will cost you a little piece of your soul. Do they make it to the beach? Yes, but it is not the blue joyous place the boy expected.""They stood, their clothes flapping softly. Glass floats covered with a gray crust. The bones of seabirds. At the tide line a woven mat of weeds and the ribs of fishes in their millions stretching along the shore as far as eye could see like an isocline of death. One vast salt sepulchre. Senseless. Senseless.""I now need to go snuggle a mess of wiggly puppies and eat a rainbow popsicle!PS. want to know what the apocalyptic event was? I'm a geoscientist and guessed it correctly (which is like cheating) ...but read down to what Erwin has to say. http://www.davidkushner.com/article/c...EDIT...I'm just now reading Twilight by Wililam Gay. Gay wrote...and he went on. He went on. He used this term over and over, and it occurred to me that these are the words in The Road. Both were published the same year. Gay obviously revered McCarthy as he used excerpts from his work as a chapter heading. Nice Easter Egg or coincidence or collaboration...I'd like to know if they were friends."

Aquí es donde yo dormía. Mi cama estaba contra esa pared. En las noches contadas por millares, soñar los sueños de la imaginación de un niño, mundos ricos o temibles según se presentaran, pero nunca el que iba a ser. Abrió la puerta del armario casi esperando encontrar las cosas de su infancia. La luz diurna cruda y fría colándose por el tejado. Gris como su corazón. Siempre es un abrir y cerrar de ojos. En esta carretera no hay interlocutores de Dios. Se han ido y me han dejado aquí solo y se han llevado consigo el mundo. Duda: ¿En qué difiere el nunca será de lo que nunca fue?

Cuando no tengas nada más, inventa ceremonias e infúndeles vida. ...Quizá el apocalipsis constituya solamente una excusa argumental en este purgatorio desolado que nos presenta Cormac McCarthy: una tierra devastada por la lluvia y la ceniza, espejismo de una civilización por la que deambulan hordas de bárbaros y peregrinos de fábula. Porque este paisaje de recuerdos difuntos parece en su conjunto una metáfora brutal y cruel de la existencia humana, obligada a preservar un fuego interior que resurge y desfallece en perpetua oscilación, condenada a perseguir la esperanza incierta de un utópico Sur."
6288,1984578489,did not like it,"The average rating for this book from my friends is 4.17 and glowing reviews. Add Pulitzer to the mix and this became that irresistible book that i had to read. So obviously I was very excited to start it.Set in a post-apocalyptic world, this is the tale of a father-son duo who are journeying towards south on ""the road."" They don't know what is it in south but they are hoping to find something""good"" at the end of this journey. Throughout this journey they try to hide from other people. There aren't many but they still hide at the first indication that someone is near by. So, yeah it is a long journey with minimal of dialogues.I haven't read many post-apocalyptic books. In fact this is the third one only. While reading this I kept going back to those two i.e. The Passage and Swan Song, and kept thinking why I didn't admire them more. Both books had much more action (and pages too), gave a close insight into people who stuck together in these dangerous times, and also gave a spine chilling version of a post-apocalyptic/dystopian world.The Road tells us how this father-son duo survive each day. Even the relationship between these two failed to impress me. While the father knows that he is about to die, instead of teaching son some survival tactics he is just sheltering the kid from everything. I get that he is a parent and every instinct in him tell him to protect the kid but how would the kid survive in these tough condition once his father is dead? He keep telling him to go south and look for good people, like the kid know how to differentiate between good and bad people when he has been with his father fof most of his life?The end seemdd very flimsy and abrupt to me. Like author was in a hurry to wrap up the story ASAP once (view spoiler)[the father died (hide spoiler)]. Also I felt like author wanted to give the reader something to be happy about. But it was done in the most easiest way considering how throughout the book it was drilled into the reader that it was a very dark and dangerous world.I gave this book 3 stars initially but once I sat to jot down my thoughts on this book, I couldn't find a thing that I liked in this book. Hence removed 2 stars. I am not recommending this book to any of my friend."
6288,901875084,really liked it,"What a book! Both inspiring and terrifying!An unnamed man and his young son are going southwards to escape the harsh winter. They travel through a post-apocalypse America. Civilization is lost! Society has collapsed, humans have been reduced to cannibals – roving gangs move around looking for victims. Some have enslaved fellow humans and use them as food. Nature has been destroyed, no animals are left.The man and his son soldier on, and scavenge whatever they can to survive. They face unimaginable dangers during their journey. The landscape is bleak, fellow humans can turn out to be enemies. The man takes every precaution possible to ensure their safety. They carry with them their meager belongings and a pistol (at times referred to as a revolver).You know this is probably the most terrifying piece of fiction that I have read till now. Real terror is not induced by werewolves and demons; it is induced when humans are reduced to predators preying on defenseless people. This book reinforced the notion how much we take the comforts and security of the society for granted. We don’t think twice before wasting food and water, and turn blind to the wanton destruction of nature which provides us with sustenance.What I liked about the book was how the author has balanced the characters of the man and his son. The son, a child really, is so generous, like he is generous to a fault, while the man is more practical to a fault. Children are innocent but a grown man knows the way of the world. The child is the embodiment of humanity.The book also reminded me of the movie – The Book of Eli, starring Denzel Washington which was about a man’s journey through a post-apocalypse America.I am not a fan of the post-apocalypse genre. Human civilization, though not perfect, should be preserved at all costs. But, this book was a worthy read. However, this book can put you in a gloomy, dismal mood. The choice is yours if you want to give it a try."
6288,57189352,it was ok,"I agree that the story is mind-boggling as McCarthy brought us to the bleak and sad post-apocalyptic cataclysmic America. I agree that the sparse searing prose beautifully mimics the sad and hopelessness of the two unnamed characters: a boy whose age and name were not revealed and the man who he calls as “Papa.” I agree that the book is a good reminder to us of what can happen if we do not take care of our environment. And for these reasons, I understand why this book won the nod of the Pulitzer jurors in 2007. The reason why I did not like this book was similar to the reason why I did not like Jodi Piccoult’s My Sister’s Keeper. There was just too much sorrow that my empathy to the characters became desensitized in the second half of the book. The hopelessness and sadness were not just too much to bear but everything became false and artificial. The repetitive dialogues of ”I’m scared”, ”Okay”, ”We will not die”, ”We are the good guys” and ”Because we have the fire” lost their meaning and became irritating. The repetitive cycle of “food found” followed by “eating” followed by “the last apple/tin can/juice/what-have-you” followed by “hunger” after sometime lost its impact and when McCarthy introduced other elements like the cannibals, thief, fever and spitting of blood, the artificiality of it all surfaced out and I just could not help feeling that I was just taken for a ride. For a person living in a Third World country, this sorry state (well, except cannibalism) is not new to me. I grew up in an island in the Pacific and if it was full moon, my fisherman father would come home without any fish. Since the island was within the usual typhoon path, whenever there were big typhoons the young coconuts would fall down so that the harvest would be very few (and my parents’ income would not even enough to pay for our daily needs). I remember that my mother would ask one of us (her four offsprings) to go to the nearby sari-sari store to ask for a can of sardines an hour before meal time so she could feed all of us including my father. So, I grew up seeing poverty, around me and even at our very home.I would imagine that the hunger described in the book would be shocking to some especially those living in the First World where, if you are jobless, you can file for bankruptcy and you live on welfare and you line up whenever there are some charitable organizations are distributing rations of canned goods for poor people. Then you don’t feel hungry anymore. For us in the Third World country, you either beg (and normally no one at some point would help you) or steal (that will make you end up dead or in jail). My point is that, even if my heart bled for the man and the boy, the hunger and the sickness that they went through were not shocking at all. If I just open my eyes and detour from my normal daily home-office-home route, I should be able to see them by rolling my car off by some few meters.It seemed to me that McCarthy, after thinking of a fantastic theme, did not know even bother to write a decent profile (in the writing workshop I attended, this is called the character’s resume) for his main characters. What happened in that cataclysmic event? Could they not just stay at home and the man defend himself and the boy againts attackers just like why Robert Neville did in Richard Matheson’s I am Legend? True that there was snow, could the man not have thought of something to insulate the wall or burn fire wood in their house’s or somebody’s house’s chimney? The boy kept on addressing the man “Papa” (and this pinched my heart each time) but why did the man never addressed him “son”? Why did the mother kill herself? Considering the man’s fortitude, why did the father not do anything drastically to prevent it?I know that I may be a minority her but I just did not get the whole thing. True that it was a good different book from the many that I’ve read so far. It was just that when I finally closed the book, it had an repugnant aftertaste: bitter and plastic. "

Check out this Wikipedia article about the end times. It almost feels like we have a very low opinion of ourselves since the beginning of time. Even Science and literature agree with this particular sentiment from time to time. Let's hope these prophecies won't come to fruition. Because it is not going to be pretty.Anyways, Let's talk about The Road. Is it depressing?

We used to talk about death, she said. We don’t anymore. Why is that?I don’t know.It’s because it’s here. There’s nothing left to talk about.

Well, a couple of my friends have a shelf named depressing-af especially for this book. So....In this engrossing story, we are dropped in the middle of a lifeless wasteland formally known as United states of America. The end times have conquered the world. There are only a handful of souls left and many are on the road, searching for something that is not there. A man and his young son walk the road among them.This is one story that I would recommend to my friends with caution. Why? Because it is unique; Unique doesn't always mean it's good. Fortunately, I found this uniqueness gripping! There are a lot of red flags here. Even though the story is set in an apocalyptic world, there is absolutely no science here; The story never reveals what happened to the world. The dialogues are short and repetitive; The prose sparsely uses any punctuation. (At first, I thought it was my edition's printing mistake! Apparently, it was not.) Yet, I found myself totally captivated by this story. The story felt deeply personal as Mccarthy's writing style exposes the reader to an idiosyncratic relationship between the father and son. It also presents the unnamed man's struggles as he does his best to keep them alive. He also has to convince his son to stay alive. He becomes a man trying to teach his kid to hope, even though he has none left in him. These moments were nothing less than moving.Another interesting aspect of the story was the people we meet during their time on the road. The horrors of what humanity can become just for survival. There are always such characters in every apocalyptic tale. But I found the nameless ghosts of this story the most disturbing.Overall, The Road delivers a story worth telling. Recommended."

The track of the dull sun moving unseen beyond the murk.”Written with such sublime prose, The Road is completely different from anything I have read before. It is tragic yet somehow simple and lovely. Through the bleak and desolate landscape of a post-apocalyptic world, a father and son make a treacherous journey of survival towards an unnamed coast. Not knowing whether life there too has been snuffed out, the two persist together with an enduring bond of love for one another and a glimmer of hope for the existence of light beyond the darkness of their surroundings. “The cold and the silence. The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air. Sustained by a breath, trembling and brief. If only my heart were stone.”I felt completely drawn into this journey. I had to reach whatever destination it was that father and son trudged towards; I had to know what would happen to them. Despite the fact that I felt the result could be nothing short of ominous, I still had a fragile sense of hope that there was something better ahead for them. McCarthy did not divide this book into chapters; whether this was his intention or not it seemed like a clever way of making the reader carry on one grim page after another much like the pair were forced to take one harsh step after another. But, how does one carry on through such hopelessness? Does good always overpower evil? “… he would raise his weeping eyes and see him standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle.”I may not recommend this book if you are in a dismal mood. However, if you are feeling relatively poised and enjoy exquisite language then certainly pick this one up. This was my first Cormac McCarthy novel and I fully intend to read another. "

So I read, taking breaks only to eat. And it was just the right length for that, in my opinion.So, this is a good story of a father-son relationship, of hope and faith fading and becoming strong like a candle, in a world where luck is now needed to find food and other necessary things. Apocalypse has taken over the world, though what kind is not told (only this description: ""a long shear of light and a series of low concussions"", heard some time after midnight), but I don't quite believe it to be that nuclear because at no point is radiation issues mentioned. It's just the man and his son that travel south, seeking some sort of better place. The son's mother has chosen to give up and is only there in their dreams, memories. Ashes, ashes everywhere so facemasks are needed; it rains sometimes, sometimes a part of forest lights up on fire by itself but the pair manages to avoid it.Ruins of houses, cities, car wrecks on the road. Food is a constant source of concern. The rare can of cola drink found, the suddenly finding of mushrooms (another point of no radiation likely). But they have some points of hope, points of abudance (view spoiler)[: the wonder bunker full of food and other useful things, the boat from Tenerife on the beach (hide spoiler)], and strange, sometimes horrifying sights(view spoiler)[: the train, the remains of a wandering group taken over by a forest fire with bodies and plastic melted into the road *ew* (hide spoiler)].There used to be more people wandering around, both good and cannibalistic, slowly fading through hunger or through the latter group attacking the former. The man and his son come regularly upon corpses during their wanderings, usually dried up or charred from fires that killed them, in houses and on the road. But they do meet people alive too... I'll just list what I found as I read here(view spoiler)[: a man struck by lightning, two separate groups of robber-slaver-cannibals, a lone boy in oversized coat about the main boy's age, a house of cannibals with a live-meat cellar, one old tramp, a thief, and so on (hide spoiler)]... but the truth is that while they meet some people here and there, there's days without meeting anyone, and no doubt the number of humans will keep dwindling on(view spoiler)[, including the group that the boy joins at the end (hide spoiler)].The book had a quiet feeling of sadness with moments of desperate action a few times. But it's a story of post-apocalypse without much fast-paced action. No quote marks - """" - but with McCarthy books you expect it to be so, and it doesn't really bother me. Yes, it's a post-apocalyptic story, but also a story of a strong parent-child bond, and a story of hope existing stubbornly no matter what. And so it is a great book. :)"
6288,6011647,it was amazing,"Ok. I know that nothing I can say can do this book justice. I will say that it is beautifully written. The characters have no names. The land has no name. Everything is covered in ash from something that happened but that we the reader are not meant to know of.The author uses simple, straight foward words to pull you into the landscape, to yank you off your couch, or out of your bed, and put you out there in the cold, walking side by side with the father and the son, walking the road.....surviving, trying to get to a better place. I. Loved. This. Book.I read it in one sitting. I could not find a place worthy of stopping. Page after page I absorbed the story.... finding myself every so often wondering if I would have made it that far... If I had it in me to live the way they were living, surviving just to survive. A bleak and weary future... if there was a future....You have to read this book."

I was like this with the Fever Series. The enjoyment I received from the book far outweighed some small character problems I had.The Road is different. It is actually brilliantly written. So wonderful in its prose and the thought behind every word that I had to give it four stars despite the immense heartache it gave me.It would have received five stars but it was a struggle to finish. Not that it was poorly written but in the end it was a little boring. There's very little ""page turner"" quality about it. What happens in this book? Not a whole lot. There is no real plot to speak of. Gloomy and depressing last page, gloomy and depressing this page and, oh, what was that? Gloomy and depressing on the next page.I sometimes felt like there were many cheap shots in this book. Babies burnt, people trapped in a house being eaten by others. There was a lot of things that I sometimes felt were there for shock value.This was a book about hope. There was none. And yet, in the end, what else do you live for if you can't hope that the next day will bring something better? What else is there for you? This is a world built without hope. Nothing grows. No animals, no plants, no sun, no joy. Everyone on the road is jaded and dangerous. This story is about the strength in refusing to despair.However, it was a great read. I'll never, never, NEVER read it again - but I'm glad I did read it. As melancholy and depressed as it left me, I'm glad I read it.Now I'm going to give my son a BIG cuddle and let him eat as much banana and bread and cheese as he likes this afternoon.I may even let him watch The Little Mermaid... again. *Shudders*Okay, maybe not."

That it's post-apocalyptic fiction is a plus, because that's one of my favorite genres of all time.I gave up after about 30 pages, though, because I just couldn't stand the way it was written. This isn't a judgment against the author or anyone who enjoyed the book, but for me, reading it was like watching a movie with an incredible plot that's shot entirely out of focus, or lit so poorly, I had to struggle to see the actors and enjoy the story.I may give it another try again at some point in the future, but I'm too old and have too little time for reading to invest it in books that make me work really hard to digest them."

This damn book was one of the most emotionally draining books I've read so far (and probably will read). Also, this one was one of the most fucked up books that I've read. Sometimes I had to put the book down for few minutes just because how hard it was to read it. This a dystopian story about a father and his son walking down one road, while around them the world we know is in ruins. The book follows two of them, trying to survive. My favorite part about this book, without a doubt, was the relationship between the father and the son. And that's why the ending of this book completely emotionally destroyed me.

6288,327099728,it was amazing,"There are large holes in my reading experience—works by acclaimed authors I ought perhaps to have read by now, novels that have created genres, shaped cultures, and incited passions. There are writers I have tried to read—really, I have—but whose styles made me want to engage in self-flagellation as the lesser of two tortures: William Faulkner, John Updike, Gabriel García Márquez; others whose classics I promise to tackle someday, when I'm smarter and less distracted: James Joyce, Nikolai Gogol, Herman Melville. Then there are those celebrated writers who choose subject matter or settings which don't much interest me. With some significant exceptions, I've never been keen on books set in the Deep South or in America's West or in a dystopian near future. So, I've always passed on Cormac McCarthy. Certainly, The Road was never going to be my cuppa. Grim, post-apocalyptic and hopeless are not for this reader who prizes sinking into a good story above all. But when I read reviews as passionate as  Nandakishore Varma's or as insightful as  Jay 's—who puts McCarthy on the same high rung as two of my favorite authors: Tim Winton and Colm Tóibín—I know I am missing something great. Why I started with The Road and why I read it during a painful, angry, bleak period in my life really don't matter in the end. Because by the end of The Road, which I soaked up, transfixed, in a day, I was a reader and writer transformed. To read The Road is to experience a prose writer as poet, forming a narrative in which each word has weight and meaning and each sentence has a rhythm, which the omission of punctuation and manipulation of words create something recognizable but unfamiliar; techniques that work in concert to shape the mood, tone and color of each scene: 
 He started down the rough wooden steps. He ducked his head and then flicked the lighter and swung the flame out over the darkness like an offering. Coldness and damp. An ungodly stench. The boy clutched at his coat. He could see part of a stone wall. Clay floor. An old mattress darkly stained. He crouched and stepped down again and held out the light. Huddled against the back wall were naked people, male and female, all trying to hide, shielding their faces with their hands. On the mattress lay a man with his legs gone to the hip and the stumps of them blackened and burnt. The smell was hideous. 
When you read this paragraph aloud, you breathe along with the man. You take in what he sees and smells, the horror dawning as the weak light of the flame reveals a Holocaust. Be warned, for three hundred pages of a living nightmare will shatter your soul. But the brutality is balanced by a tender and beautiful relationship between the man and his son. McCarthy's story, absent of all sentimentality and sheared of all hope, still allows us to believe in mercy and dignity. The reader never learns why the world was nearly destroyed or by whom or what. The plot is as bare as the blasted out forests and abandoned cities that the man and his son trudge past on their way south, to the ocean. We never learn what they hope to find there, at the water's edge, at the end of their world. The past and the future are not relevant to The Road. Only the present journey matters, and it serves as a warning to a world in grave danger of losing its way. I don't know that I could read The Road again. But I will return to passages, to be reminded of the power of word choice and placement, the poetry of well-crafted prose. And although I know this novel stands apart from others in McCarthy's œuvre, I look forward to exploring more of his world. "
6288,137127437,,"This isn't the review you think it is.When she woke in the cave in the light and the warmth of the morning she'd reach out to caress the child sleeping beside her. Nights glowing beyond brightness and the days more colourful each one than what had gone before. Like the onset of some warm aurora illuminating the world. Her hand rose and fell softly with each miraculous breath. She pushed away the covering of knitted fabric and raised herself in the crumpled robes and blankets and looked toward the east for remnants of darkness but there were none. In the dream from which she'd wakened she had wandered into a forest where the child led her by the hand. Sunlight playing over the moist and thick-barked trunks. Like pilgrims in a fable enchanted and lost among the winding paths of some living beast. Shallow stone streams where the water gushed and sang. Whispering in the babble the minutes of the earth and the hours and the days of it and the years into infinity. Until they stood in a great wooded clearing where lay a many-coloured and mysterious lake. And on the far shore a creature that raised its dripping mouth from the shimmering pool and stared into the light with eyes electric blue and all-seeing as the gaze of eagles. It bowed its head low over the water as if to confirm the scent of what it saw. Crouching there pale and naked and translucent, its alabaster bones cast up in shadow on the trees behind it. Its lungs, its beating heart. The brain that pulsed in a shiny glass bell. It tilted its head from side to side and then gave a high pitched cry and turned and stepped along the bank and loped joyfully towards them.I used to know this woman whom I'll call Lydia and she was a bit weird. She wrote awful poetry and worse prose. She sent me this a while ago. An idea for a fantasy she had. Told me she'd showed it to some guy she'd met in Mexico. He'd read it and told her to keep practising. Said she needed to learn how to construct sentences. Cut out the flowery adjectives and the lengthy descriptions and the conjunctions appearing several times in one sentence.And he said that nobody would want to read about a woman and a kid on an adventure where they journey through a beautiful world filled with people who are kind and caring and who believe in and act upon the essential and innate goodness of each other. Nobody would be interested in a happy kid growing up in such world under the loving eyes of her mother or empathise with a parent looking forward to watching the development of her child.So she asked him would it matter if she wrote about a different relationship. He'd told her to stick to writing females. She wasn't competent enough to write males. That was when she asked me what I thought.Well. Her prose was disorienting, surreal, too colourful, too much like over-the-top films and CNN broadcasts flashing the latest pictorial world headline. And this guy in Mexico, actually I thought he might have had a point. Who considers identifying with an obviously desirable and completely unreal utopia, and who believes, anyway, in the essential goodness of humanity? Zen monks, maybe? We're all so zoned out with just getting on with our lives, aren't we?On the other hand, if she'd decided to write a dystopia, using washed out, dull and gray prose painting a landscape like this:[image error]and rendered her characters as empty receptacles into which the emotions of the reader could be poured, with dialogue that kept them as nameless and faceless as this:then she would have achieved the goal of extracting an intense empathic response from the reader which justified her own feelings, while simultaneously allowing the reader to experience an emotional blood-letting scorned or avoided in real life.I figured that if she used the kind of prose which seems to be spare and crafted, that reads like a movie script or a play, she'd render a portrait bleak and stark enough to capture the attention of our visual-media-swamped oculi. Nothing to interfere with the absorption of the reader into this dark and forsaken world.She wasn't really happy with my answer. She didn't want her readers to identify with fictional characters. Just as she wanted to record her own happiness, if she was going to write about ugliness, she wanted to record a real dystopia, like this:or this:with ecological destruction such as:and:forming the setting for her story.What story? A couple of starving kids in Africa? A few hectares of burnt rainforest? So what. Who cares?Then she surprised me. She talked about a book she had read called hector. She told me how the author described in painful and vivid detail the life of someone we all know, and about whom we never think, who suffers on a daily basis and has no joy in life, experiences no serenity, no peace, no fulfilment, and could just as easily be you or me. And she said she cried when she read this book, and wished that other people would read it also, and change the way they thought about that someone, and act differently toward that someone, because that might bring us closer to the utopia she imagined as real.I promised her I'd read it. What else could I do?But she didn't stop there. There's another book, Existence Costs. She told me how she walked with the author around a city where people lived and worked and ate and slept every day, completely unaware of 'the others', the ones who raided garbage bins for food, who slipped silent forever beneath a placard pleading for recognition, who shuffled through the subways without a place to rest, to stay, to belong. Real people, who were gray amongst all the dapper business suits and colourful slogans advertising the next 'must have' on flashy billboards and on blaring loudspeakers. She wanted empathy for those people, because their reality was an urban dystopia from which they could not escape, but which they deserved no more than the inhabitants of the city deserved their insularity and well-being.I assured her I'd look at this book, too. It seemed the only human thing to do."

Or so it may seem.I generally enjoy dystopia and post-apocalyptic novels but this here was a tough one for me to read. Cormac McCarthy sets an overall mood throughout the narrative. A bleakness that followed you as you read. What followed was a character-driven plot with a very perplexing writing style.McCarthy is a poet. A brilliant one at that but the format of this book is taxing. Where are the quotation marks? Apostrophes? Semi-colons? And why combine it with a narration that switches often from the third person and first person point-of-view? It was hard enough to look up archaic words and bear through the repetitive dialogues.The format left me disoriented yet I found the story to be touching. I was amazed at how McCarthy embedded a tender and enduring love story of a man and his son amidst the gruesome and horrifying tale set in a desolate landscape.Overall, it was a conflicting reading experience. The prose is not to my liking but the story makes up for it. Worthy of the Pulitzer Prize? Maybe so. Would I recommend it? Only if you have read enough adult literature."

Even a small glint of hope is hard to come by as a man and his young son wander endlessly in search of sustenance. 'The frailty of everything revealed at last.'

      “People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didn't believe in that. Tomorrow wasn't getting ready for them. It didn't even know they were there.” 
    





Finally sitting down to review this modern classic and after finishing it 4 days ago I am still haunted by the atmosphere. I have read a few books that actually left you feeling cold and isolated, this definitely joins that list with its haunting presence and minimalistic style it will leave you thinking and glad that it isn’t a reality.

    “You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.” 
  

  The premise of the book is very mysterious in the sense that the author doesn’t reveal the name of the place or the characters, we follow two of them a father and boy (nameless) as they navigate through a barren land on the aftermath of a disaster which almost wiped everything. The father decides that they have to go south on the beach for safety and we follow them, their thoughts, relationship and it is so quite but a powerful one.
Before reading this book I had originally seen a review from Max of WellDoneBooks Review Here and I was instantly captivated by everything he commented on, I now understand why McCarthy is on everyone’s top list. His use of language is so weird and minimal almost disjointed but the overall outcome of each paragraph just works. He crafts such moving sentences that I find myself rereading some or would stop my friends and read it out loud to them. eg...

“Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”



      “He walked out in the grey light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.”
    

Nothing much happens plot-wise because of the anonymity so the reader pretty much focuses on the two characters and trust me you will not put this book down. You constantly want them to find the promise land to overcome the odds but deep down you also know that it is hopeless to even think that this will end up on a happy note. I appreciate that McCarthy didn’t try to explain what happened prior to the current situation because the book would have lacked its originality. The unnerving feeling is almost similar to
 The Handmaids Tale by Atwood
 in which the story felt like it could happen. Scary enough the burned bodies and the empty scenery was similar to the aftermath of a nuclear war & I was freaked out, I even got a little emotional towards the end as the book was such a slow burn that as you read on you don’t realise how much it packs a punch till you close the book. I really do want to read all of Cormac McCarthy’s backlog so if you are familiar with any of his other books please tell me down in the comment section. I also can’t wait to see the adaptation of it because a lot of people have praised it for its atmosphere.So until next time stay Bookish ;)

6288,1774380228,really liked it,"Dark but powerful, The Road is about a father and son who are travelling through a destroyed world. They're trying to get to the coast and south to warmer climates, but many obstacles lie in their way. In addition to starvation because of the nuclear fallout, the duo face external threats like cannibalistic tribes of savage men and women. But it's not just a battle to save their bodies, the father must teach the son the proper way to live (like not eating other people) to save his spirit from the crushing darkness that has overtaken everything. It is a struggle to retain the internal spark that divides humanity from the animals. This is a book about survival in a dystopian reality, but it is also about the sustaining and literally life preserving power of love.My one complaint about this book is that the author didn't clearly label who was speaking during the dialogue. He just went down a line to illustrate change of speaker. I had a really tough time keeping track of who was saying what. Take this passage, for example: ""Can I ask you something? he said. Yes. Of course. Are we going to die? Sometime. Not now. And we're still going south. Yes. So we'll be warm. Yes. Okay. Okay what? Nothing. Just okay. Go to sleep. Okay."" pg 9 The whole book is like that, anytime anyone is talking. Otherwise though, this is an amazing, heart-pounding, thrill ride of a book.I loved the father's advice to the son throughout the journey: ""A corpse in the doorway dried to leather. Grimacing at the day. He pulled the boy closer. Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might want to think about that. You forget some things, don't you? Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget."" pg 10 The father/son relationship described in here was fascinating to me. Generally, at least in my experience, the relationship between a mother and a child is the closer one in the family because of certain biological imperatives. McCarthy flips that whole paradigm on its head with this story. In here, it is the father who stands between the child and death. It is the father who finds meaning in a world gone mad through helping the child find food, stay clean, and stay protected from the elements.""The boy sat tottering. The man watched him that he not topple into the flames. He kicked holes in the sand for the boy's hips and shoulders where he would sleep and he sat holding him while he tousled his hair before the fire to dry it. All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you've nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them."" pg 63. I think one of the main lessons in here is that life holds the meaning that you assign to it. And, even if civilization falls apart, you can create your own mini-civilization through your actions and intentions.""He'd had this feeling before, beyond the numbness and the dull despair. The world shrinking down about a raw core of parsible entities. The names of things slowly following those things into oblivion. Colors. The names of birds. Things to eat. Finally the names of things one believed to be true. More fragile than he would have thought. How much of it was gone already? The sacred idiom shorn of its referents and so of its reality. Drawing down like something trying to preserve heat. In time to wink out forever."" pg 75 Beautiful. If civilization ever ends, look for me at the library. Probably will be reading this book. :)I picked this classic up because of David Schaafsman's excellent review which you can read here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Some read alikes: Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel, Railsea by China Miéville, or The Last One by Alexandra Oliva."
6288,1497152182,it was amazing,"Unthinkable yet just around the corner: the scariest kind of sci-fi nightmare. Dark, gorgeous, understated, visionary, devastating. Sadly, one of my all-time favorites."
6288,75232803,it was amazing,"Sometimes I just need to change gears with no notice and no serious analysis. I’ve always had this behavioral tic. I’ll just come home on a Friday after a long week and shave my head, or buy and wear women’s t-shirts or interlocking male symbol earrings (you can borrow, just ask). Or pick up something short and compelling to read while toiling through never-ending (yet very worthwhile) behemoths. I did this a few months ago by racing through The Stranger and The Lover during my earliest foray into Proust; with To the Lighthouse while reading Infinite Jest. And now I’ve done it again with The Road, which my brother suggested would act as a good ‘palate cleanser’. True. There’s something about taking a long time to finish books that, independent from my actual enjoyment of the currently-readings, frustrates me. I can’t figure out why this is, but I imagine that it’s not unusual and may account for the long-book phobia common among people who still read a hell of a lot of pages/books per year. It isn’t readily apparent why one long book is harder to tackle than three or four short ones over the same time period, but I think most would agree that this is indeed the case. (Thoughts?) At first I suspected that this need-to-finish anxiety may have been exacerbated by Goodreads, but I now believe that this website actually keeps me accountable and encouraged to finish long books by threatening me with admission of failure in front of 60-odd (not ‘60 odd’--that number’s probably closer to 50) stranger-friends. So anyway, with no end in sight for the other books I’m reading, I wanted a quick fix. No matter how pathetic the need from which it stemmed, I had to feel the satisfaction of finishing a book, and soon. So I picked up The Road, which promised to be completeable in a few solid sittings, and it certainly fulfilled that requirement. I can’t recall ever being sucked into a story so quickly and thoroughly; McCarthy immediately invokes a desolate setting and desperate mood with only the barest of sentences. It’s like he’s tapped into something so primordial that we humans can’t help but sit transfixed. I think it’s pretty damn close to “The Entertainment” that DFW dreams up in Infinite Jest--something so entertaining and engrossing that we’d give up eating/going to the bathroom/sleeping to continue with it. This is getting a little excessive, but bear with me: it’s been a long time since I read a real page-turner. In a sense, The Road is kind of like a kid’s book for adults, in that it reminds me of the experience of reading when I was child. I’d pick up a Roald Dahl, and it was creepy and moving and delightful and I just couldn’t put it down; McCarthy pushed the same buttons that Dahl was manipulating all those years ago. I’d forgotten what this sort of reading experience was like, and its reemergence was a welcome revelation. Raw, visceral power in a book allows you to forgive a great deal, and thankfully, McCarthy doesn’t push his luck too hard with the reader here. Yeah, his punctuation omissions are unnecessary and annoying, and he frequently switches words around into awkwardness for novelty’s sake, and occasionally he pops out with two-sentence paragraphs that are borderline nonsensical in the context of the book. But given his masterful instinct for pacing (notable for its utter unnoticeability while reading), and the gripping sense of purpose and dread he infuses in each paragraph, these truly become minor quibbles. Perhaps most impressive is how simple McCarthy makes it all seem. I bet more than a few writers and would-be writers read this and thought, “Damn, if only I had written this first,” rather than the actually true statement of “Damn, I wish I could write something like this.” In no aspect is this beautiful simplicity more apparent than in the preternaturally moving and sparse dialogue. After the first few father-son exchanges, only a couple pages into the book, I knew that this story had the raw materials to really get to me, in the same way that Kevin Costner asking his dad for a catch makes me swallow in an embarrassingly audible fashion at the end of Field of Dreams. And the book followed through on that early promise. Boy, did it ever. Cried like a baby. Never before have I seen two or three-word sentences carry that kind of weight, convey so much with such unwriterly restraint. Along with the dialogue, it’s the book’s handling of morality that elevates this to the 5-star level. The setting allows for a distilled treatment of basic goodness that's astonishingly potent. How often did I find myself siding with the father when the protagonists encountered others on the road? How often did my own cynicism and skepticism match his, while I became impatient with (what I perceived as) the boy’s innocence and naivety? My tears weren’t only for the characters in the book. I am ashamed and in awe. "
6288,582423497,it was amazing,"I bought the book six days ago and I've read it twice in a row. It left me with the strangest feelings both times. McCarthy is a brilliant writer with a style that is uniquely his own. I cannot decided if I love or hate the story. I will not lie, I got overly emotional at the end of the book each time I read it. It's not for everyone. If you like neat little happy endings then buyer beware. I've already recommended it to almost all my friends, to be able to discuss it with someone because nobody seems to have read the book in my real life... and maybe because I'm a little freaked out and need to talk to somebody about it too... lol"
6288,1632410592,it was amazing,Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.Two Shades: A Story of Black and GrayBleak is an understatement. Brilliant is fitting. You love McCarthy or you hate him. There is no God and we are his prophets.
6288,1567863015,it was amazing,"Cormac McCarthy... prose poet. Amazing writing. You almost don't care that very little happens in this novel about a man walking with a kid down a road post apocalypse. If you're strictly interested in action, this survival story may not interest you. If you are a writer and have a fondness for words, you definitely want to read The Road. "
6288,2083326577,really liked it," We are in a world transformed by bleak devastation that matches the psychological devastation of our characters, and yet it is a world in which the flame of ""the fire"" is kept alive with a father and son against all odds with the moral abandonment all around him. The conversations the man and the boy have together are brief, but meaningful. Both reassuring the other that everything was going to be alright. This novel shows extreme love between a father and son.We follow the journey of a man and his boy as they make their way south to the sea in search of warmth. What landscape they are walking through, we never discover. We might guess, perhaps, the Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern United States, but there is really no evidence to support such suppositions. And if these facts are unclear, the two characters are even more unclear. They are nameless, the man is referred to only as ""he,"" the boy is usually ""the child."" We discover that the man's wife committed suicide sometime after the apocalypse, but we learn nothing more about them.There is a poetic force to the spare language which at times attains a curious beauty, and which always impels the reader through its silent emptiness with all the drive of a novel crowded with incident and colour and character. This book is strangely emotional, dark, sad, loving and I was glad when I was done. But not. It took me way outside of my comfort zone. McCarthy's prose in this book are wonderful and you definitely get to know the characters"
6288,101394141,it was ok,"Some spoilers.I honestly wasn't impressed with The Road. Like it's title, it seemed to drag and drag.I dislike McCarthy's writing style. I've read only one of his books before (Child of God, 1974). I wasn't impressed with that one, but I decided to give The Road a try, since it was written more than three decades later, won a Pulitzer, was made into a movie etc.Boy, was I wrong. It reads just like Child of God. I don't know why the guy receives so much praise for writing if all he does is ignore punctuation, quotation marks, splices together two words into one and such. His dialogues are also dull - either there's a lot of sadism ( he/she said) or he just mixes his speakers who talk one after another and make the reader unable to decide who's who. Apparently recognized and acclaimed authors can do this and the public will think that it's okay while it's not okay okay ? okay.I couldn't help but wonder about the cheesy sentimentality of it.I enjoy stories about fathers and their sons who struggle against the cruel world, but it's difficult to read page after page about a man who pushes a shopping cart full of stuff while his son constantly tells him how's scared he is and how good that his papa is with him. The struggle is difficult, but not too much; there is apparently a fallout shelter full of food hidden just for our heroes to find. The papa tells the son constantly how they're the good guys and how they're carrying the fire. Didn't he notice that everything around him is burned to ash ? Lol.All this is sparkled with sentences like ""The snow fell nor did it cease to fall."" What ?Oh, and at the end the heroes reach the south, and (surprisingly) there's nothing there. The Father dies, But no worry, a man has been shadowing them and he takes the boy with him. If you're making a postapocalyptic work a Hollywood ending is not exactly good - and that's why it has been made into a movie. It's basically an award bait, emphasizing the strenghth of the human spirit, the importance of ecology etc. Wonder why the boy doesn't wear a ""I SHALL PREVAIL!"" T-Shirt.I know that the cold, detached prose was meant to reflect the state of humanity, the postapocalyptic grayness and other mystycism that's in the novel. But McCarthy just fails at it. All he has to offer is a bunch of banal, uninteresting sentences, tedious murmuring between father and son and a whole lot of weeping and shallow sentimentality. The print is large, the paragraphs are scattered making this seem more a novella than a novel.You can safely skip The Road - it won't give you anything that you don't know already. Rather poorly written - the constant abuse of grammar rules is not cool, it's just poor. A post-apocalyptic rehash of better stories, such as Mad Max or I Am Legend. Two stars only because I'm a sucker for dystopian fiction."
6288,587884953,it was amazing,"SPOILER ALERT IN PARAGRAPH 3!I got The Road as an audiobook from my local library and listened to it at night just before going to sleep. I had intended to read the book since it came out but it was always on loan in my library, so I just put it off. Fortunately, my library has recently added an ebook and e-audiobook section, and I was able to download it when it became available. It was an abridged edition, so I'm not sure how much I've missed. The hard copies are still all out on loan, so I can't check.The Road had an enormous impact on me. Perhaps it was the mesmerising voice of the narrator -- I loved that voice! Perhaps it was also the fact that I turned off all the lights and just listened to the voice, an arrangement that I think suited the bleak atmosphere of the book particularly well. I was able to detach myself from the external world completely, like when we say 'I got completely absorbed in that book' only this time there was not even light, not even the side vision that you have when reading a book, no matter how concentrated you are. It also depends on whether you think what is described in the book can become reality or not. If you think this is pure fiction that might be useful in deciphering the depths of human nature, but can never happen, then I you'll probably not going to lose much sleep over it. If, however, you think that the kind of destruction that forms the background of the book is a real possibility (and by this I don't mean it will happen but that it can, in principle, happen in the not-too-distant future), then you're bound to take the book more seriously...There are of course gaps in the story line. Is this a destruction that affected the whole of the planet or just the United States? How did people survive in the years between the destruction (that's not explained but taken for granted) and the events currently described the book? Has all industry and all agriculture collapsed and if so how do the remaining people survive? Yes, I know, through eating each other and through accidentally bumping into bunkers full of tins but this could hardly sustain a population, no matter how small, over extended periods of time. Have other countries been spared the catastrophe and if so, what communications are there with this?"
6288,1713106127,it was amazing,"“Nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave.”These words would shape the theme of the story. There seemed to be so little hope, and they really just wanted to take their own life, but they couldn't, because they were holding on to something , because they had the fire, as they said, which would hold an even deeper meaning in the end of the book.McCarthy wrote this as a love-letter to his son, which is fairly obvious throughout, depicting the difficulty for a father to try and raise his son in a world which is dead. What I really noticed throughout this book was the incredibly simple dialogue, often sentences that were only a few words long, and sometimes even less. It almost seemed slightly comical at first, but when I thought about it a little, i really noticed how realistic his depiction of the conversations between a father and a son in a post-apocalyptic society actually was.What is so great about McCarthy, is that he does not trivialize the difficulty of their situation. He never tries to give the reader hope, there is however hope throughout, it is never however, brought about by McCarthy himself. What this gives us is an incredibly bleak, yet realistic, depiction of a post-apocalyptic world in which we would never want to be in ourselves. Therefore i believe this book can be treated as a warning for what is to come, if we do not stop destroying our own world."
6288,901662840,really liked it,"A dark and brooding meditation of a man and his child’s struggle to survive in a society that has decayed and collapsed around them. This is a short but thought-provoking novel with an unconventional narrative style…full of ambiguity. Names are never used and the reader has only a vague notion of the cataclysmic event that preceded the story. The detached tone and obscure details render the novel all the more menacing as it mirrors the reality of living on a planet without our massive world infrastructure.Post-apocalyptic novels are not what I usually choose to read. However, I was mesmerized by this book. For me, it was like living a little slice of what it might be like after some catastrophic occurrence. Because of 9/11, our constant fear of terror attacks and all of the current wars and unrest in contemporary society, it almost felt prophetic. "
6288,2040945426,liked it,"This book is universally lauded. It won the Pulitzer. Though this terrifying tale was both devastating (soul-crushingly dark) and deeply moving, I struggled mightily with the writing style and the repetition. I understood the reason behind those stylistic choices, but combining that with my not being a fan of the post-apocalyptic, this didn't reach me the way it did others. I wish I felt differently. 3 stars"

It didn't even know they were there.""3.5Beautifully written and grim, 'The Road' focuses on two characters traveling through a dying world in a dead civilization. Ash covers everything, even tainting the sea itself, and nothing pretty remains. It soon becomes clear that the point of the novel isn't to show why the world was destroyed or a reason behind the madness, but the purpose is just existing and why a father holds on to such a limited life. Love may not conquer all in a reality that's destroyed, but it's still a light that radiates a bit of calm and peace.The man doesn't even get a name, but the bond he feels for his son is tangible, as are his memories of a wife who still haunts. Contrast between someone who bailed and someone who stayed due to their child is interesting. The bond was what drove the story forward, not a hidden message or one particular scene. World-building was brutal but it wasn't complex with explanation. I still don't know what happened to their world, a Nuclear Winter matches with the ashes, but the author makes a point that it doesn't matter anyway.It's definitely not an action-intense story. There are a few harrowing scenes that up the tension stakes and I just knew it would end brutally but was secretly hoping for a semblance of a happy ending because really - this needed a little light shed through the dark world covered with soot and inhabited by deranged survivors who look for people to victimize, steal from, rape and actually eat. Cannibalizing is mentioned quite a bit. I won't delude myself into assuming this wouldn't be our reality either - but still, give me a little hope, especially when a small child I bonded with is involved. I'm happy with what realism the author injected into a grim circumstance, but I'm also happy he threw me a small bone of peace at the same time. Yeah, I'm a softie.It's bleak, it's brutal, it's memorable - but my enjoyment of it did not reach the five star label. The pacing is fine and it's mainly the writing and emotions that keep it riveting, but it's not a heavily paced story. Don't mistake this to mean it's ever boring, because it never is. The Road is an apt title because the point of the book seems to be the experiences on the journey but not the journey itself.McCarthy is writes beautifully. Poetic prose with few commas and unconventional dialogue format. Run-on exists but you just don't care with his bleak style. I'd read Harold Bloom remark that he is one of the four great novelists writing today while he heavily promoted his 'Blood Meridian'. I look forward to reading more of his books, to walking with him on more of his desolate roads.And no, I haven't seen the movie yet."
6288,4620979,it was amazing,"I bought The Road on a whim from some tiny airport bookstore on Long Island, NY. I was dismayed by the Oprah sticker but I lugged it to the counter, where I was informed by the woman that if I kept the receipt that I could return the book for at least half the price. I decided then that if I didn't like it, I could at least get 8 dollars toward another book.I left the bookstore, removed the horrible ""Oprah"" sticker, started reading the book in the terminal and didn't put it down for 8 hours, literally. I was even stopped at baggage claim in Chicago, where I was still reading the book and glancing up every minute to see if my bag had passed me by, by a man who gushed with me about how amazing it was.The story that Cormac McCarthy creates is dark, heavy and at times terrifying of a man and a boy. On the flip side he also creates a story that is full of hope, burnt hope that under all the black soot still burns red. You never find out much about the man or the boy, including their names. You never find out what the man might have done before the world fell apart, though at times it is kind of alluded to. You never find out where they are coming from or exactly the spot they are searching for. In fact, sometimes I think that I never knew much about the characters except WHO they were.The fact is: This story is not about the post-apocalypse. It is not about why all the trees have been burned or why people were burned straight into the road. It is the story about two people and their quest to keep their hope alive, no matter what the cost. it is a story that perhaps more parents can relate to, that small hope that our child will have a future and he will carry on our flame in their hearts to keep hoping.I believe that this book is one of the more amazing books I have read this year.Sadly for the lady with her tight curled gray hair and weak chipped-toothed smile at the airport bookstore, I won't be returning The Road in order to obtain more word porn. It's staying right where it is on my bookshelf so that I might, just maybe, be able to share it with someone else very soon."
6288,1505423347,it was amazing,"What does one say about ""The Road""?This text is brutally disheartening and uplifting, and all at the same time. Not an easy feat to accomplish! I won't rehash any plot points here, that has been done to death. But I will say that McCarthy is a master at using his prose to exploit the emotions of his readers. The characters are indeed flat and one dimensional, as some negative reviews have pointed out, however, that is the point. They are archetypal characters, and are the Everyman of medieval morality plays. The boy is the young innocent, as yet untainted by the corrupting forces of maturation and humanity. He still possesses the ""light"" of human compassion, responsibility, and morality. The father represents the man searching for grace and redemption in a world where he can no longer find it. But there is the son, his (and our) hope.You as the reader find yourself elated at a simple trove of old, shriveled apples. Rejoicing in the father's momentary find of abundance in a bleak landscape.You find yourself devastated when you can understand the father's motives for abandoning other survivors to certain death. Wishing that you, like the boy, could not.You find yourself pondering at the wise and quizzical ranting of the ""prophet"" Ely, and wondering why those kinds of people always provide more questions than answers.And your heart soars when you discover at novel's end that death is not the end of all things, and that hope is undying and not a unique part of humanity. You realize it is something that is innate in us all, and if we cultivate and protect it in ourselves, there will always be a chance for humanity.Is ""The Road"" an allegory? Maybe?Is it Biblical in character, prose, and story? Definitely!Read this text, but read it with others so that you can discuss it. It will make for a rewarding experience."
6288,1485935404,really liked it,"4.5-starsStark, bleak and beautifully written. Full review to come...stay tuned!"
6288,17850945,it was amazing,"Immersed in the world of The Road, I wrote a review for my blog, and rambling though it is, thought i'll include it here :What can you say about a seventy four year old author who has been interviewed by the media just thrice? That his work is dark and luminous? That he brings to life the contemplation of death? That he loves Dostoevsky, Faulkner and Melville, in alphabetical order? I knew very little about Cormac McCarthy until I heard that he had won the Pulitzer Prize for The Road. Last Monday, a two hour wait for a delayed flight at the Chennai airport sent me into a bookstore. Going in to check for Vikram Chandra's Sacred Games, I ended up purchasing The Road, Peter Carey's Theft and John Updike's Terrorist. Cormac came first, since I hadn't read any of his work. I finished The Road in a couple of flights, and cab rides in Delhi and Bangalore. 
Warning : Plot details follow -
The back of the book says ""A father and his young son walk alone through burned America, heading slowly for the coast. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. They have nothing but a pistol to defend themselves against the men who stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food - and each other."" That is one more hyphen than I found anywhere in the novel itself. The pistol is to ensure that the two can kill themselves before being taken by others who will ensure a slow, horrible death. The world is disintegrating, even ""the names of things slowly following those things into oblivion"". What is left of humanity reverts to barbaric practices.The first thing that strikes you about the book is the form rather than the content - Spare prose that somehow is denser than the richest writing possible. An eschewal of punctuation that doesn't seem contrived. Words like rimstone, slutlamp, gryke, riprap, gambreled, and these in just the first 16 pages of the paperback, unfamiliar but evocative.The atmosphere of much of The Road is laden with futility. Deep stone flues where the water dripped and sang. Tolling in the silence the minutes of the earth and the hours and the days of it and the years without cease. Yet the father and son carry within them a fire that smoulders on against the nothingness that surrounds. A blushing Cormac admits in an interview that the novel can be seen as a love story for his son. He describes an incident in his relatively recent fatherhood as the spark that created the story. The love blazes through the novel and culminates in a climax that appropriately has been described as redemptive.Apocalpyse and its aftermath have been imagined for centuries. Yeats' The Second Coming has always been a favourite verse of mine. I can't help noticing some connections between his poem and Cormac's prose -Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer; Like the great pendulum in its rotunda scribing through the long day movements of the universe of which you may say it knows nothing and yet know it must.A shape with lion body and the head of a man,A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,Is moving its slow thighs, ...... twenty centuries of stony sleepWere vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
... a creature that raised its dripping mouth from the rimstone pool and stared into the light with eyes dead white and sightless as the eggs of spiders. Crouching there pale and naked and translucent, its alabaster bones cast up in shadow .. It .. gave out a low moan and turned and lurched away and loped soundlessly into the dark.
Yet the connection could be more due to the lyricism of The Road, rather than any allegory the two have in common.The book has been received with acclaim, and Cormac talks of it in a rare interview. He says it is just about the boy and the man on the road, but obviously you can draw conclusions about all sorts of things. License having been given, I speculate about the Biblical themes in the novel. The Man and the Son of Man. In this case, it is not the Son who (though he loves the world entire) gives his life up, but the Father. In so doing, he provides the only light in a dark story - salvation for his only beloved Son who is then enfolded by the rest of good humanity. A cataclysm that sounds like the casting out of Man from Eden. The Woman who succumbs to temptation - this time taking Death for a lover as she cannot face continued existence. A house that the Man enters after they have run out of food - there is seemingly nothing in it, but the Man stops on the grass half-faint. He looks back to see the Son watching him. Suddenly he seems to find the ground beneath him special. It is - a bunker with a huge cache of food lies beneath. Food that is like the multiplying of loaves and fish. A prophetic voice in the wilderness that does not see any sense in prophesying - People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didn't believe in that. Tomorrow wasn't getting ready for them. It didn't even know they were there.The pivot in the book seems to be the discovery of a stranded sailboat by the man and the boy. Named Pajaro de Esperanza, or the Bird of Hope, it evokes the Trinity completed by the Holy Ghost, who is usually depicted as a dove. It also brings to mind an Emily Dickinson poem, Hope is the Thing with Feathers Hope is the thing with feathersThat perches in the soul,And sings the tune without the words,And never stops at all,And sweetest in the gale is heard;And sore must be the stormThat could abash the little birdThat kept so many warm.I've heard it in the chilliest landAnd on the strangest sea;Yet, never, in extremity,It asked a crumb of me.Dickinson of course lived a hermetic life, much as Cormac McCarthy seems to. To return to the novel, it gathers pace after the man and the boy retrieve as much as they can from the boat (leaving behind a sextant - a beautiful object but of no use in a world in which precise navigation is pointless). The boy sickens with fever and recovers, only for them to find that all their belongings are stolen. When they catch up with the thief and repossess their cart, something changes. The boy has always had compassion for the stray humans and animals they come across in their wanderings. The man ignores them as much as he can in his desire to keep the boy safe. After the latest encounter, the father says to the boy, You are not the one who has to worry about everything. Yes I am the boy replies, I am the one. After this pronouncement, there seems to be very little left to do, except for them to reach the south and the Father to hand over the flame to humans. Yet those undertones seem to come to nothing. The religious symbolism does not resolve into anything explicit, which is just as well. Like a reviewer says, if we do destroy the planet it will be [perfectly plausible that it is:] because of religious faith and not in spite of it.In a 1992 interview, Cormac comments ""There's no such thing as life without bloodshed. I think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea. Those who are afflicted with this notion are the first ones to give up their souls, their freedom. Your desire that it be that way will enslave you and make your life vacuous."" The realization that I can be eaten by my neighbour when the planet immolates and the local grocery store stops delivering food is one that will clarify the priorities in my life, I think. I do not jest. The casual cannibalism in the book is shocking. The immediacy of portents on our planet that can result in the world of The Road lets me know how powerless I am, and a vast majority of humanity is, in shaping our future. A few men and women often deluded by the trappings of their office will dictate our legacy to our children.There are very few words strung together of late with the power to bring tears to our eyes. Ten thousand years of history seem to render every generation a little more immune to the power of the written word. The Road reminds me how it was for a writer to take ahold of my mind and make it imagine. In the Oprah interview, Cormac talks of his life and how just when things were truly truly bleak, something totally unforeseen always happened. His novel is full of unforeseen events that allow the man and the boy to carry on, and the end must be the most unforeseen of them all, for a Cormac novel. Oprah also asks him if he is passionate about writing and as he hesitates, describes how she goes around telling students to follow their passion. Cormac sets her down gently, calling passion a fancy word but says he likes what he does. I hope he continues to like writing and writes more than ever."
6288,60694640,really liked it,"I've always been interested in the end-of-the-world genre, though its quality has always existed along a broad spectrum, from the pulpy to the philosophical. After thinking about this for approximately ten seconds, I've decided there are two broad types of doomsday novel. You can deal with people waiting to die, as in Nevil Shute's minor classic On the Beach (it's like Jonestown in Australia!), or you can follow survivors as they try to...well, multiply, such as in William Brinkley's entertaining, if overwritten, The Last Ship (featuring some of the best/worst sex writing ever!). Cormac McCarthy's The Road is somewhere in between. The protagonists are not waiting to die, nor are they planning to repopulate the earth. Instead, they're on a journey, a road trip if you will, but not the fun kind of road trip where you drink Red Bulls and eat gas station hot dogs and stay in Super 8s. Something horrible has happened to the world as we know it. It's not really clear what. A war? Some kind of environmental disaster? An asteroid? A comet? An asteroid and a comet that have fused together and then slammed into earth? The repeated references to ashes make me think nuclear war, but nuclear winter would've ended this story a lot quicker (think of poor Steve Guttenberg's hair falling out in The Day After; or better yet, don't think about that). The references to the tragedy that befell this earth are oblique: The clocks stopped at 1:17. A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions. He got up and went to the window. What is it? she said. He didnt answer.If you're looking for details as to what happened, you can look for them in the same place that McCarthy put all his apostrophes. Aside from this description and a few dreams and flashbacks, we are placed in a hauntingly burnt-out place that is both similar and horribly strange. (You can't tell what year this is supposed to take place in. Moreover, you aren't even sure this is America. If you search the internet, you will find people have actually expended time theorizing about these questions). The story is as simple as you can get. Almost a parable. There are two main characters: the man and the boy (McCarthy thinks capitalizing proper nouns is gauche). The man is the boy's father. The world has been destroyed. They head towards the mythical south where they hope they might find other ""good guys"" like them. Page after blunt, grim, nightmarish page chronicles their arduous trek, as they search for food and water and attempt to evade the masked gangs of cannibals that roam the scorched landscape. They passed through the city at noon of the day following. He kept the pistol to hand on the folded tarp on top of the cart. He kept the boy close to his side. The city was mostly burned. No sign of life. Cars in the street caked with ash, everything covered with ash and dust. Fossil tracks in the dried sludge. A corpse in a doorway dried to leather.The writing is taut and constrained (though McCarthy has an annoying habit of throwing a $100 word into a $5 sentence, so that I have to slink with shame to a dictionary). Though simple, there is a certain lyricism to the descriptions, and the imagery is quite vivid. It even gave me a nightmare, though I have an overactive imagination and a Nyquill addiction, so I don't know if the book caused it. (I have a friend who is a doctor, and he says it's probably the Nyquill).On the way south, the man and boy see some awful things:They walked into the little clearing, the boy clutching his hand...He was standing there checking the perimeter when the boy turned and buried his face against him...He turned and looked...What the boy had seen was a charred human infant headless and gutted and blackening on the spit.The man tells the boy: You wanted to know what the bad guys looked like. Now you know. It may happen again. My job is to take care of you. I was appointed to do that by God. I will kill anyone who touches you. Do you understand?The world that McCarthy has created is unrelentingly bleak. There is no law, no humanity. The air is shot-through with evil. You can't trust anyone. Everyone is out to get you: to steal from you; to murder you; to chain you up in a basement and eat you from the feet up. Odd, then, that McCarthy chooses to leaven this dark atmosphere with some utter corniness, as embodied by the angelic boy. The dark scenes in this book are hard-hitting and do not pull back; the soft scenes in this book seemed culled from Hallmark cards, Tuesdays With Morrie, and blog posts by Paulo Coehlo. Without doing anything to spoil the ending, I will say I was disappointed. Throughout the story, there are several deux ex machina moments, where the man and boy manage to stumble into some food trove that allows them to survive. I felt the novel ended in a similar vein, coming as it did from nowhere. However, at least I understood it, which is saying something with McCarthy. After the danse macabre that concluded Blood Meridian, and Sheriff Bell's opaque dream to finish No Country For Old Men, I appreciated being able to figure out what was going on without taking a masters-level English class devoted to parsing the last few paragraphs.The Road seems to be a continuation of the ""widely accessible"" phase of Cormac McCarthy's career, which I have enjoyed of late. I'll even forgive him his cooler-than-thou, punctuation-be-damned style. "
6288,112174070,it was amazing,"I've read most of McCarthy's books, and he's an American original, no doubt. He's also, often, one of our darkest writers. For example, Blood Meridian has to be the bloodiest book I've ever read. And Outer Dark is, well, Dark. Then came his Border Trilogy. You can see the Light coming through. But at the end of Cities of the Plain, you could see the Darkness returning. Indeed, the weirdness of that book's ending signals to some extent The Road. The Road is McCarthy's greatest book, his Billy Budd, his Old Man and Sea, but more fulfilling than either of those great books, because the stakes are higher. The book is grim, austere, operating on the border of despair, as a father and his son walk through what seems to be end of the world. As a reader, and parent, I felt an extreme ache throughout, as the two dodged one new Bronze Age danger after another. In one leap, McCarthy has jumped over the admirable efforts of both genre writers and literary ones, whether it be Stephen King (The Stand), William Golding (Lord of the Flies (technically not an end-of-the-worlder)), or the many others who have looked hard at the End. The reason why is that McCarthy has staked out his post apocalyptic territory with the weighted language belonging to Job or Jeremiah. The lament is stoic, but real, the destruction endless. So what of Love? Hope? I couldn't anticipate the uplifting feeling I found at the end of the book, but it was well-earned. It's a hard road indeed, for both the reader and writer, but one well worth traveling. "
6288,536892760,liked it,"I have to thank Vanessa for lending me The Road and saying (after I first declined to borrow it) that it’s quite a good book but it’s also one of those books that you either love it or hate it. It’s always a pleasure to be surprised by the quality of a work when reading a writer for the first time and Cormac McCarthy is no different fortunately.Wandering a Barren Earth:In brief, The Road is a post-apocalyptic story where a boy and his father journey from where ever they are supposed to be towards the south, to the sea. They seldom encounter life and when they do (or think they will) it’s usually someone in a much sorrier state than them or its the ‘bad guys’. As they make their way on foot, we get glimpses of the dismal surroundings, an occasional grotesque scene and the hardships of starvation, loneliness and uncertainty. The theme of hope and love is represented by the relationship between father and son.Quick Prose with Subtext:What I liked here was the prose. While I’d normally be irritated at writers who choose to change convention with things like quotations or sentence construction etc.. the fact that there was no punctuation other than full stops (or the scarce comma for subclauses) didn’t bother me one bit. In fact it made the experience all the more enjoyable because McCarthy opted for short simple sentences, which represented both the urgency and the bleakness that the characters faced.The descriptions were at the right level, not too detailed or gory but occasionally hinting at that, which left a lot for my imagination. They also added to the novel’s bleakness as well without going into overkill. The boy and his father – both nameless – had short, succinct dialogue, just enough to reveal what kind of characters they were and the relationship they had without any narrative explanations needed to elaborate on this. McCarthy certainly has a technique all of his own at work here and it’s simply beautiful.The Plot Holds Back:What bothered me was the repetitiveness of situations making the pace slow. Twice I thought I was going to deal with the boy and his father starving but then they would stumble upon a stash of food. Likewise I thought at several junctures in the story they were going to face the ‘bad guys’ but this never materialized, and I’m still not sure what to make of the action scene at the end of the book.Basically McCarthy painted a picture of people who were cannibals and ‘evil’ but I never encountered them. That left me wanting… and yet, was that the whole idea – the power of suggestion? Or the fear the characters had of the unknown that helped spur them to their goal?Which brings me to another point, the goal seemed bleak too! Why head South to the sea when you don’t even know for sure that there are other ‘good guys’ alive or where they may be. I suppose all this points to the plot and my dislike of its deployment. One gap too many for the me to fill which didn’t make it come across as tight enough or convincing enough. I think the emphatic focus on the boy, his father and their relationship outbalanced the plot and the action involved with it, this in a story where the plot would have been as equally useful.McCarthy for me:I’m curious now to read some more of his novels. I’ve read about some of them and they seem interesting enough. I’m interested in his style of writing and how different or similar it will be across his books.Any recommendations?"

6288,9175919,it was amazing,"This is the bleakest book I have ever crawled inside. When I wake up in the morning after having gone to sleep reading it, it's as if the grit of ashes is still caught in my eyelashes. The desperation of the man clutches around my heart. I have known that horror and loss of hope, if only for fleeting moments. I know the chasm this character teeters at the edge of. Oh this is the abyss we all frantically, busily keep ourselves distracted from knowing. Cormac McCarthy drags us through it, unflinchingly. I hate him for that. But now that I'm inside of it I can't look away. I'm almost grateful for the luxury of despair this book wallows in. The fact that the cover of the book is black and unadorned is perfect. Warning: this is not a gay romp.I'll let you know how the rest is when I'm finished... but I'm pretty sure there are going to be no happy endings. There have been no happy beginnings or middles, so... pffft. Don't think so.ETA: and indeed, I was right. No happy endings. But it wasn't as bleak as it could have been. For that, I am grateful. Really one of the most important reads of our age."

6288,2613237687,liked it,"3,5 estrellas.Si tuviera que destacar algo de esta historia es el desasosiego que provoca. El libro está lleno de descripciones, de paisajes desolados, pero sobre todo, de acciones. Todas y cada una de las acciones que tiene que llevar a cabo ese padre con su hijo para sobrevivir un poco más, auque sea un minuto. Todo cuesta. Sobrevivir cuesta. Y luego la recompensa es mínima, porque ni siquiera tienen tiempo para disfrutarla, no hay un momento de solaz. Todo es gris, y la forma de narrarlo acentúa esa sensación. Es una sensación buscada, pretende que no puedas disfrutar del color o el sabor de ese mundo, porque todo es un erial. ¿Para qué seguir viviendo en ese asco de mundo? Y sin embargo lo hacen, porque los humanos somos así. Muchos se rinden, sí, pero otros muchos no. Aunque tengo la sensación de que hay algo que no llego a comprender del todo, de que el mensaje intrínseco de la historia se me escapa. Tal vez por esa conversación sobre dios que tienen con aquel vagabundo, o por cómo termina la novela. En cierto sentido, creo que va sobre cómo nuestros progenitores siempre nos mientes, a veces para protegernos, otras para protegerse a sí mismos. Cómo los hijos heredan el mundo de sus padres, un mundo que puede ser una mierda por culpa suya (hay guerra, violencia, una crisis ecológica...), pero es lo que les toca, aunque no lo hubieran querido, aunque nunca pidieron nacer. Cómo se puede heredar la violencia, pero cómo, también, se puede romper con ella. Cómo los ideales, esos constructos sociales como son la compasión, la justicia... incluso la esperanza o la fe, puede que sean mentiras que nos cuentan nuestros mayores, pero son esas mentiras las que nos hacen humanos, las que al final nos salvan.Puede que vaya de todo esto. O puede que no. Puede que lo haya entendido mal. Puede que solo sea una historia sobre un padre y un hijo en un mundo postapocalíptico que deben sobrevivir cada día, por miserable que este sea, enfrentándose al hambre, al frío y a otros seres humanos."
6288,1331392339,it was amazing,"“There is no God and we are his prophets.”Darkness and ash fill the skies. A life that they had known is gone. A father and son are walking to the coast, and along the way he cares for his son by protecting him, by teaching him how to survive during their long walk through what is now barren land of America. What do they expect to find at the coast? Warmer weather? Less ash? What destroyed the planet? The author never says, he doesn’t have to because we already know deep within. Conversation is limited. The boy’s father has ash in his lungs, and if you can’t breathe, you say as little as possible. You just have to walk, to get there. And then there is the shock of what had happened, the death of family, of friends, of most who were once living. What does anyone who has survived have to say? “Listen to me, he said, when your dreams are of some world that never was or some world that never will be, and you're happy again, then you'll have given up. Do you understand? And you can't give up, I won't let you.”“Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might want to think about that.You forget some things, dont you?Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.”The most beautiful prose, the most powerful words are in this book, and it feels like every word is a jewel or a reminder of what can and shouldn’t be. “He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.”“Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.” Cormac McCarthy said in an interview that this book is a love story to his son and so considered his son a co-author. They had both been in a hotel room, his son sleeping while he was looking out the window at the city below, and in his mind’s eye he saw the town being destroyed by fire, and that was how he realized this book--his best. Update April 16, 2016:I am re-reading this book while on the trip that my husband and I are taking across the middle of America to the east coast. The book feels new, as if I had never read it, and so it remains just as powerful as it had the first time I read it. Maybe it always will. I know I will read it even again someday.We have just visited Senoia, GA, one of the places where they film ""The Walking Dead,"" a post apocalyptic TV series that we can’t get enough of. Georgia is so beautiful; the world is so beautiful, and to think that all of this can happen to it, to us, to all life. It seems closer to happening now than it ever has, and for this reason I am filled with tears when I re-read some of the passages of the book that I posted here. There is a fence that surrounds the community of Woodbury, as it is called in the TV series, The Walking Dead. It is to keep the walking dead out. But now, some of the people of Senoia live behind that protected gate in wealthy homes. A guard sits in his white car just outside, and if you get too close he will tell you to stand behind the railroad tracks. You look back and you see the tracks and realize that you are really not that close, but you obey his arbitrary command, the line he has drawn, and you realize that the tourists have now taken the place of the walking dead because it is now they who wish to enter. And in the motel at night you think about how strange it is that you are taking a trip with this book and are going to the coast and have just visited this community, which was not planned in the beginning, except for coast.And if I could give a book more stars, I would give this one 20."
6288,34528308,it was amazing,"Haunting. This was an incredible read for me. Never read McCarthy before. Totally blown away, master of language imo. Love the style. The starkness, imagery, use of language. Phenomenal. This will not be up everyone's alley but worth trying out especially if you enjoy a certain mastery (and style) of language. Also recommend if dystopias are your thing (personally I LOVE them!). But when you come down to it this story is about relationships, human emotions and coping under extreme duress, themes that are universal. Dystopia is merely the backdrop but it is important. A dying earth... setting the stage for the themes on the nature of hope, redemption, love, loss, fear, suffering. Many things are unspoken and unwritten, McCarthy doesn't show you or tell you everything, and this mystery adds power and poignancy to the story forcing you to think, imagine, fill in the blanks. He is crafty in what cards he shows you and what cards he decides shall remain hidden. No need to worry about overexplaining and overwriting from this writer!I was riveted throughout the story (focused on a man and his son). There was a pall of tension, mystery, and terror overhanging the whole thing that kept me reading and reading. The granular details and writing brought it to life in the most amazing ways, the story ended up hitting me hard, much harder than I could have imagined. I was quite surprised by that. The way McCarthy describes things, he has a granular mechanistic approach and understanding of a lot of things, both industrial things and natural things. I think he is a lover of the outdoors and as I found out because I was curious he worked as an auto mechanic, so his understanding of the industrial and how it infuses the writing makes a lot of sense. I found McCarthy's mechanistic, granular detailing had a grounding effect on the story and made the horror (of the situations, backdrop) all the more palpable, making this terrifying reality pop up with contrast.I haven't read much fiction of late, and reading this was like a lighting bolt to the head. Yowee. Love. I often think the best fiction, or the fiction that we end up connecting with, is the fiction that puts a mirror up to our own selves and helps us see and think about life and how we are operating in this thing.And that ending (I mean you see this coming, the pending outcome slowly unfurling throughout the book but it still hit me like a truck)... just damn.How does a person maintain purpose, hope, keep traveling down the road when they have lost everything? I guess the only thing you can do is hold tight onto that fire and make sure it doesn't go out. Because without that there is nothing. It is not easy to keep alight. The question of morality is central and what type of person one chooses to be is a question that features prominently in this book."

6288,1285934346,really liked it,"Read for the 2015 Reading Challenge: #18 A Pulitzer price-winning book 3.5 A very interesting, emotional and smart read about good, evil, humanity, family, innocence. A post-apocalyptic jewel. Expect the slow build up, and long descriptions with shorts conversations. Expect the feeling of isolation. More than a story about the end of the world, it is a story about human reaction against despair and death. In fact, most of the time it feels like a philosophical read, especially towards the end. It can get a little repetitive at times and tedious, but this is undeniably a great read. 
""Tienes que ser rápido. Para poder estar a su lado. Abrazarlo. El último día de la Tierra.""
Bueno, bueno, bueno, ese fue un viaje bastante desesperado y depresivo. Interesante, también, sobretodo en el aspecto técnico. No hay capítulos ni diálogos escritos como tales. Siendo honesta, me perdía en algunos y debía releerlos para saber quien decía que cosa. Es un libro bastante lento, y aunque es muy corto se siente muy denso, algo en la atmósfera que crea es pesado y lúgubre. Y es algo que cuenta a favor y en contra de la novela para mí. Muchas veces estaba inmersa en la lectura, las descripciones me intrigaban mucho, y en otras tantas me aburrían, sobretodo por lo repetitiva que podía resultar a veces la trama. Lo impecable en esta novela son los personajes, sin saber sus nombres y prácticamente nada de su pasado, terminas queriéndolos mucho. Los llegas a entender tanto al padre como al hijo y sus muy diferentes formas de ver las dificultades que les llegan. No esperen explicaciones, ni nada de eso, porque no las van a obtener. El final es algo apresurado, pero me hace pensar que tiene un mensaje más emotivo/filosófico metido ahí que no pude captar en su totalidad. Alguien que ya lo leyó que diga que le pareció? Me es difícil darle un objetivo al libro, creo que el autor intento plasmar la desolación que puede uno sentir, y lo importante que es seguir adelante y no estancarse solo porque se encuentra un lugar agradable donde estar. Las decisiones que tomamos y como estas pueden desviarnos hacia lo bueno o lo malo. Y a mi parecer lo logra con creces. Aunque creo que cada quien interpretara o vera cosas distintas o le dará mas importancia a otros aspectos de la historia. Definitivamente lo recomiendo, sobretodo ahorita en época de vacaciones, porque si puede resultar pesado de leer en algunas ocasiones. Les recomiendo que lo lean despacio, ya que tiene unos pasajes muy lindos. Un libro muy emotivo, lleno de humanidad. 
Tranquilo, dijo el hombre. Tarde o temprano todos los árboles del mundo tienen que caer. Pero no encima de nosotros.

Se sufre toooodo el tiempo.De verdad me gustó mucho y ese final me destrozó pero lo disfruté más cuando me enteré que McCArthy había tenido un hijo siendo muy adulto y que este libro está dedicado a él. Es como una carta o un manifiesto para su hijo con el que le quiere decir algo como: la vida es muy dura, te vas a encontrar con muchos obstáculos y gente que te quiera lastimar, pero debes seguir adelante y ser bueno siempre.Y no digo más porque tengo que llorar e ir a buscar la película que me han dicho está muy bien adaptada, además tiene a Viggo Mortensen...pa qué más?"
6288,1602094424,it was amazing,"I just realized that I've never rated this book, nor have I written a review! Shame on me!I can't remember when exactly I've read The Road but it was some years ago and yet Cormac McCarthy's voice is still fresh in my mind and the horrors The Man and The Boy have faced are still with me. This is one of those REALLY post-apocalyptic books that are so dark, you can't read them often (which, funnily enough, is exactly what makes it so realistic in contrast to many Hollywood-ish stories).Many have critizised that not much is happening in the story but I find that to be untrue (or undiscovered by some readers). The real happenings are between the lines. The acts of sacrifice and kindness and love and stubbornness against all odds.The story is about a man and his young son who live in a world devastated by some apocalyptic disaster. It is noteworthy that while the book never states what exactly it was and gives no hint whatsoever that it was a nuclear war, the movie shows gas masks that made me think the producer wanted to push the audience's imagination towards that. I, personally, rather think it was an asteroid or meteorite that hit Earth (there is a banked ship amongst other things that indicates tsunamis, we have huge forest fires and ash so thick in the air that it blocks out the sun, maybe also from volcanoes). Moreover, I think it is important that the catastrophe wasn't man-made. Why? Because the author gives special emphasis to the human connection, the odds being NOT in our favour, us being the plaything of fate. Saying we made this would give humankind too much power and importance I think.Anyway, the catastrophe happened quite some time ago, before the boy was born and (view spoiler)[the mother couldn't stomach the new world so she unfortuantely killed herself (hide spoiler)] which is something I will never support. Don't get me wrong: McCarthy's descriptions make it more than clear why anyone might despair in this world but still ... (view spoiler)[not only could I not bring myself to give up hope (I'm extremely stubborn and would not leave my husband behind), I could definitely not do it once I had brought a child into this or any other world (hide spoiler)]!At a certain point, the man and his son have to go and find a warmer climate so they can survive the coming winter. There are a lot of obstacles on the way such as (view spoiler)[losing their meagre supplies and cannibals (hide spoiler)], which give us a glimpse at different paths a human can take after such a catastrophe.Through it all however, there is one thing that remains a constant: the man telling the boy that they are ""the good guys"" and the fact that he will not give up until his son is somewhere he will have a fighting chance.As dark as this book is and as many nightmares as it brings, I've always seen this as a positive tale. Love, despite all the fear and darkness, was the driving factor ((view spoiler)[not to mention the salmon, a mythical creature, at the very end and that family picking up the boy (hide spoiler)]). There is a point to be made about the man (view spoiler)[sacrificing himself because the boy's nature is brighter, ""better"" than his own, which might be why the boy lived and the father didn't (hide spoiler)] but I like that the author leaves that for the reader to decide. Just like McCarthy introduced figures who believe in God and others who don't. He shows the entire spectrum without judgement.The lack of quotation marks and the writing style in general need some getting used to but the landscape descriptions are hauntingly beautiful and nest themselves deep inside you. One of the rare occasions I use the phrase ""a must-read""!"

Loro si muovono in mezzo ai boschi ormai grigi,su asfalti illuminati da una luce di piombo, trascinando a stento un carrello che raccoglie la loro vita, le loro poche provviste per sopravvivere dove ormai non esiste più nulla. Loro,  “l’uno il mondo intero dell’altro”, si difendono da un’umanità incattivita, selvaggia, famelica e senza più morale. Loro sono diversi. Come Prometeo portano la luce.

Ho però avvertito una certa monotonia nelle descrizioni collaterali, che mi sono parse ripetitive, benché la scrittura rimanga sempre di alta qualità.Riconosco che il libro possa definirsi bello e che ci siano lettori capaci di apprezzarlo compiutamente.

Maybe because I adored the fact that nothing is really explained or made clear. Maybe because the image of the cannibalistic horde traveling along an ash-covered highway will haunt my dreams tonight. Maybe I was blown away by the sheer, crushing hopelessness of this story. Maybe it's because Road Warrior is one of my favorite movies and I just loves me some post-apocalyptic wasteland literature. It could be all of these reasons, or maybe I still can't put my finger on why I spent the better part of today finishing this book with bated breath. I'll go back to this review later, once everything's sunk in, and try to figure it out then. PS: this book is not on The List. I thought it was. WHY IS THIS BOOK NOT ON THE LIST?

Seu pai era advogado e providenciou aos filhos uma educação em escolas católicas. Descendente de famílias nobres Irlandesas, optou por alterar o seu nome para Cormac McCarthy para o equivalente gaélico de ""filho de Charles"".Após duas tentativas, não concluiu os estudos universitários em artes. Alistou-se na força aérea, onde permaneceu 4 anos, dois dos quais no Alasca. Trabalhou como mecânico de automóveis, mas foi pelos prémios literários que ganhou na universidade enquanto estudante, que lhe deu o impulso para continuar a escrever. Alma em constante desalento, com sede de ver e experienciar o mundo, Cormac viajou pela Europa durante anos, Irlanda, Inglaterra, França, por fim Espanha, onde aprendeu a falar castelhano.A sua experiência de vida, combinado com a sua qualidade da escrita valeu-lhe ganhar vários prémios, que o mantinha financeiramente e lhe possibilitava andar pela estrada.

O segundo filho, John Francis, nasceu tinha ele 66 anos.O autor ultrapassava a casa dos 70 anos de idade quando iniciou esta caminhada. “A estrada” foi publicada em 2006. Fonte: http://www.cormacmccarthy.com/biography/O livroA história versa sobre um mundo distópico, onde não se sabe bem como, talvez pela ganância e avareza humana, talvez por punição Divina (autor deixa esta consideração para o leitor), o planeta está reduzido a cinzas. Os animais morreram queimados, assim como as culturas, as florestas, as casas, as fábricas. Os lagos, rios e mares estão poluídos e sem vida animal. Os poucos humanos que sobrevivem a esta apocalipse tentam viajar pela estrada para o Sul. E porquê para o Sul? O autor não refere, mas na sua opinião e esperança da continuidade humana reside no Sul, é lá que estão as pessoas boas. Uma viagem, pai e filho caminham pela estrada em permanente alerta, fazem-se acompanhar de um carrinho de supermercado onde vão guardando algumas coisas que vão encontrando que lhe poderão ser úteis. A fome, a sede, o frio, os dias curtos e as noites intermináveis e gélidas vão derrubando todas as barreiras da humanização. O autor providência duas visões do ser humano, os homens bons e os homens maus. O filho preconiza os bons, a sua puerilidade e infinita bondade, o pai preconiza o mau, não por estar na sua génese, mas porque devido às circunstâncias, nenhum homem é bom. O amor incondicional que o pai tem pelo filho, a esperança que deposita neste para dar continuidade à vida humana, obriga-o a exporem-se aos perigos, para conseguir mantimentos e sobreviverem até chegarem ao fim da caminhada, o Sul. Ao longo da caminhada, os dois vão encontrando resquícios de vidas humanas, que vão falecendo e desfalecendo à beira da estrada, uns escondem-se como podem, por medo, medo do ser humano que aí vem, outros, faltam-lhes a força para continuar e vão servindo de alimento. Mas nem tudo são espinhos, quando tudo parece perdido, há uma esperança, que por golpe de sorte se abre uma brecha de pequenos momentos de felicidade. Incomodou-me muito o alçapão com os estropiados e o bebé."

I read this hot on the heels of a two day sprint through World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War by Max Brooks. Clearly rather than feeling that spring has now sprung, the over-long British winter has rendered my outlook bleak and dystopian. Don't worry - it's not altered any of my other fundamental personality traits and I am still a confirmed vegetarian and not about to start chewing on the puny office-based limbs of work colleagues any time soon.The first thing that many people comment on is how they struggled to get beyond all the ""bleak"". Bleak? This book makes the surface of the moon look like Disney's Magic Kingdom. Some might even be happier to try and transit into space without the aid of the appropriate astronautical equipment and watch their lungs get sucked up and out of their mouths like a double headed balloon on a sinewy string, rather than attempt to survive in the post-apocalyptic world as described by Cormac McCarthy. The man and the boy are making their way across a landscape ravaged by an undescribed event which has ended the world, reduced the population and covered everything with ash. One might speculate that god finally extinguished his cosmic cigarette and used planet earth as a convenient ashtray. The new world is empty of birds and animals, water and air are contaminated and food is scarce. Survivors are divided into two camps - those who are desperate to find other members of humanity in order to create a new civilisation. To raise a community again and settle down somewhere safe. The other camp is desperate to find other members of humanity so they can settle down, light a big fire, hog-tie and BBQ them and use their brains for dipping sauce. The anonymity of the man and the boy add to the bleakness. By never revealing names or biographical details it is as if McCarthy is trying to encourage us not to care about them and to remind us that such things as names, place of birth and other identifiers are only important when there are enough people around the make such badges of individuality seem necessary. When it's just you left, why bother with a name? Ultimately you might care about their fate but you might also spend a long time hoping that deliverance will be through the merciful release of a swift death. This book seems to have divided goodreads into a love/loath camp. I'm erring towards the side of love for this but I can see why many others felt it was too one-sidedly dark."

He may be lost in the wasteland. We may never fully know. Anyway, I'VE finally finished. It took me a little while to get into the rhythm of how McCarthy writes, but soon enough it was flowing along at a steady pace. This book is basically the granddaddy of all modern dystopia novels (well, this and The Jungle by Upton Sinclair-- another one I have yet to read), and I had to keep reminding myself of that fact because as it went along I was always strongly reminded of Ashfall (which I highly recommend if you haven't read it). It's not fair to say not a lot happens in this book, even though that's what it felt like sometimes-- you could tell from the back-and-forth dialogue between the man and the boy that there were so many things going on in their minds that weren't being said. I do think this is overhyped a little bit, and once I watch the movie again this will probably wind up on the liked-the-movie-better shelf, but mainly because I think I find it similar to Lord of the Rings -- almost excessively wordy and drawn-out in its meandering style, whereas the film adaptation streamlines a lot of that just by giving you sweeping shots of the landscape. I'm not discounting McCarthy's talent, not at all, I just think this is one aspect where the films can do something just as well as the books.I went through this book almost clinically; that is, I don't know that it ever sparked a lot of emotional response, until the end. Eyes welled up, the whole bit, and it surprised me because it really felt like it came out of nowhere. Here I'd spent the last two weeks with this book not feeling a whole lot of anything and then WHAM. If you're one of those few people like me who still hasn't read this book, be prepared for that ending.

On this road there are no godspoke men. They are gone and I am left and they have taken with them the world. Query: How does the never to be differ from what never was?
Whenever I read good dystopian literature, I am always convinced that I would rather be at ground zero and gone immediately than to deal with what comes after. In Cormac McCarthy’s depiction of what would occur after the ultimate world destruction, a man and his son are survivors trying to find their way back to something that might resemble civilization. Although the father tells the boy there are other “good guys” out there, the further into this story I wandered, the more I doubted the truth of that statement. Perhaps the most harrowing thought was that this did not seem improbable as an end of the world scenario. After all, he who is ruthless will most likely survive he who is not. I can’t really say this is an enjoyable book, but it is thought provoking and makes you hope that man will be wiser in the end than our imagination forebodes. I wonder if there is the kind of strength in people today that would allow them to deal with this kind of hardship. I know there would not be that kind of strength in me. 
He walked out in the grey light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in the their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.
I know there are those who do not care for this book. It is bleak, sad and scary. However, forewarned is forearmed and lightness in a book on this subject would be misplaced."
6288,545528719,liked it,"There was a whole lot of road. And a whole lot of walking. And a whole lot of nothing.I made the unfortunate mistake of seeing the movie before reading this book. Despite picturing Viggo Mortensen walking that road, it did not bring this book to life -- the movie was far, far better. (As was The Lord of The Rings trilogy where Viggo also did a whole lot of walking, if I recall. But I digress.) McCarthy's very sparse prose doesn't do this story any credit: I felt like I was walking behind the ghost of Hemingway, who was trying to talk, but couldn't get through the cosmic plasma enough to communicate his thoughts clearly. You see, to use words sparingly, to good effect is one thing. To write as if you were talking while your throat had been cut is quite another.I bow my head in shame before all those who thought this was the best post-apocalyptic novel ever written. But ... nah. It's just not doing it for me. Empty, yes. Vacuous, more apt a description.The ending -- the part that always changes things for me -- raised this to three stars. (The last 30 pages or so turned it from a 1-star rating to a 3-star. Pull on my heart strings in a certain way, and it gets me every time.) Once again, a tip of the hat to Hollywood, they did it better. This was my first McCarthy book. It will also probably be my last. I wish I had heeded Robert Frost, Two roads diverged in a wood, and I/I took the one less traveled by,/And that has made all the difference.Sometimes, it's better to stick to the highway."

6288,429192244,it was amazing,"The living is sparse a few walk upon the land.The two of us, my son and i wonder the land constantly on the movenever in one place for more than a nightwe eat what we can find.Canned fruit in high numbers.My younger companion is constantly asking me questions of which the answer I can't really give honestly.Will we meet some good people?How many are alive?When will the road end and how?When the food is no more will people yonder resort to eating each other?In the quite times when I watch over him at night I read and I contemplate on the parallel life led in a great journey of survival on the road in a world gone to the dead in a book called The road by Cormac McCarthy. The story rings true to what we are faced with, everything i just mentioned of our day to day survival, the main characters find themselves in the same dilemma.The prose, language and simplistic storytelling communicates a story of hope and great significance,I hoped for the father and son to reach safety and good health. The story captivates and demands your attention in a continuing beautiful prose that provides hours of effortless reading taking you through their plight down a road that ends either in one of two fates safety or death.Loss, death I have witnessed itbut we will not submit to it we shall not part company we die and live together companions on this road.The son in the story also has this want to never be parted, the tragedy they are part of bonds them forever, a closeness that could not have been a fact in the world before the darkness spread upon the earth. I hope this struggle we are midst proves to be a lesson and aids any souls who read of this, those that find themselves too part of a struggle for survival, to not give up hope.These two roads/journeys.The odyssey explained here and in the novel The Road be carried forward eternally retold in time to the masses.For the greatness of the human endeavour, love, bond with hope against fears to survive. We have plenty fight in usThe fire is not out!Burning eternally in us and the characters unavoidable fates.Shocking, harrowing and heartbreaking this story was and so is our plight if I only had more time to add to this brief accounting of mine.As day is soon to come close I must catch only a few hours sleep,I must watch over my son while he sleeps for safety from the walking dead.My son must not have knowledge of this walking dead, as i wish for his heart to not beat unhealthily and his nightmares be more harrowing.They have no rest in searching out food,The flesh of man has never before been of such demand till now since the fallout and breakout. Indeed we possibly are all living on borrowed time like that of the two in 'The Road.'The sense of another world yonder, beautiful and peaceful, beckoning and calling for our souls is a surety an inevitable end that gives me hope and the conquering over the fear of dying.Cormac McCarthy commands the page with a lyrical style, originality and language his own trademark like that of another great writer that comes to mind who has expired but voice alive in his works, William Faulkner.The author is a genius, a true understander and writer of the plight of the people, tragedy, love and war, hopes and fears upon this terrible beauty. A dwelling place on borrowed time.For us and those characters contained in 'The Road.'(This is a review with a different approach using a fictional voice)
""Nghts dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before. Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world. His hand rose and fell softly with each precious breath.""""He lay listening to the water drip in the woods. Bedrock, this. The cold and silence. The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth agin. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air. Sustained by a breath, trembling and brief. If only my heart were stone.""""In those first years the roads were peopled with refugees shrouded up in their clothing. Wearing masks and goggles, sitting in their rags by the side of the road like ruined aviators. Their barrows heaped with shoddy. Towing wagons or carts. Their eyes bright in their skulls. Creedless shells of men tottering down the causeways like migrants in a feverland. The frailty of everything revealed at last. Old and troubling issues resolved into nothingness and night. The last instance of a thing takes the class with it. Turns out the light and is gone. Look around you. Ever is a long time. But the boy knew what he knew. That ever is no time at all.""""They squatted in the road and ate cold rice and cold beans that they'd cooked days ago. Already beginning to ferment. No place to make a fire that would not be seen. They slept huddled together in the rank quilts in the dark and the cold. He held the boy close to him. So thin. My heart, he said. My heart. But he knew that if he were a good father still it might well be as she said. That the boy was all that stood between him and death.""""In a drawer he found a candle. Now way to light it. He put it in his pocket. He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intense earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.""""The land was gullied and eroded and barren. The bones of dead creatures sprawled in the washes. Middens of anonymous trash. Farmhouses in the fields scoured of their paint and the clapboards spooned and sprung from the wallstuds. All of it shadowless and without feature. The road descended through a jungle of dead kudzu. A marsh where the dead reeds lay over the water. Beyond the edge of the fields the sullen haze hung over the earth and sky alike. By late afternoon it had begun to snow and they went on with the tarp over them and the wet snow hissing on the plastic."" ""They slept more and more. More than once they woke sprawled in the road like traffic victims. The sleep of death.""""They trekked out along the crescent sweep of beach, keeping to the firmer sand below the tidewrack. They stood, their clothes flapping softly. Glass floats covered with a gray crust. The bones of seabirds. At the tide line a woven mat of weeds and the ribs of fishes in their millions stretching along the shore as far as eye could see like an isocline of death. One vast salt sepulchre. Senseless. Senseless.""

6288,1068512,it was ok,"Review for Chimes (May 11, 2007)“The blackness he woke to on those nights was sightless and impenetrable. A blackness to hurt your ears with listening. Often he had to get up. No sound but the wind in the trees. He rose and stood tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings.”In his new novel “The Road,” Cormac McCarthy portrays the journey of a father and son across a bleak, post-apocalyptic world in stark, muscular prose. The plot, structure, style, characters and dialogue are all barren, echoing the landscape through which the unnamed characters traverse.McCarthy never explains why or how the world is barren and dead. All we know is that a father and son are pushing their shopping cart of canned food, a map, a tarp and a loaded pistol down empty roads, seeking the coast or a warmer climate for winter. The rest of the world, it seems, has either reverted to cannibalism or died.The structure of the book reinforces its bleak tone. Its 240 pages (in large font, mind you) are composed not of chapters, but of small narrative or descriptive nuggets that are never more than one page long. The sentences, too, are short, punchy and at times lyrical, reminiscent of Ernest Hemingway. This style, like Hemingway’s, is intensely effective for a short story or novella – just read “The Old Man and the Sea” sometime – but halfway through the book, the short sentences lose their impact and become tiresome.But McCarthy goes beyond Hemingway at times and ends up trying too hard. For example, in the following passage, the son spots a corpse in the road (they seem to appear nearly every other page) and asks his father about it:Who is it? said the boy.I don’t know. Who is anybody?“All horror all the time” seems to be McCarthy’s mantra, and while post-apocalyptic literature certainly requires the theme of hopelessness, it need not dominate the work like it does in “The Road.” For example, Samuel Beckett’s play “Endgame” is equally bleak, yet one laughs at its absurdity through the whole production. Instead, McCarthy over-emphasizes the darkness, making the novel predictable and boring on occasion.Despite these faults, the general critical response to “The Road” has been positive. In the last three weeks, it won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was selected for Oprah’s Book Club.While the Pulitzers aren’t perfect in their selections (e.g. “Gilead”), their praise of “The Road” is warranted. Digging beneath the structure, style and tone, one finds at the core of the novel the classic father-son story of tension of love, frustration and the inability to communicate.Another way to see the father-son relationship is as an allegory. The ever-cautious father represents Survival. He frequently threatens, steals from and sometimes even kills other people to save his son and himself. The son, contrarily, represents Compassion. He often pesters his father to assist the ravaged, desperate people they encounter. The novel, then, becomes the inner struggle between serving oneself and serving others.A final interpretation is to see “The Road” as an attempt to face mortality. An old, accomplished writer at the end of his life, McCarthy faces the mystery that lies beyond the grave. Perhaps the darkness of the post-apocalyptic world is the darkness of death, and the father and son are our wandering souls searching to make sense of the incomprehensible terror of the present and the rapidly fading memories of the past.In “The Road,” Cormac McCarthy brings his audience into a grim and barren landscape through his (tiringly) stark prose, forcing them to confront the possibility of a dismal future. As a graduating senior, I hope I won’t have to relate."
6288,233685270,it was amazing,"Very, very dark. Apocalyptic. The story of a journey to a better place, in a world destroyed by events unexplained - in a world where, in all probability, there is no better place. A man and a boy. A battle with the elements, with the lack of food and water and with other survivors.It's bleak, grim in extremis, but I loved it!"
6288,1893405983,it was amazing,"I co-host the Glowburn podcast; a podcast about post-apocalyptic roleplaying. I've been a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre since I was very young, being raised as the son of a military man during the cold war. It seemed fated that one day the bombs would drop and we would all wake carrying guns openly in the streets fighting four-armed, two-headed mutants with glowing eyes.Or at least, that's what we wanted to believe.But that's fantasy.The Road hits closer to potential reality. And it isn't glitz and guns and heroic escapes. It's about survival and scraping by in a gray, boring landscape where most of the other inhabitants - when you can find them - want to rape you, kill you, then eat you. Every step is tedious and terrifying.And yet, somehow, McCarthy has carved out a thing of dark beauty here. Part of the beauty is due to the sheer economy of words the author uses. Much of the dread is unspoken, implied between the words.He woke whimpering in the night and the man held him. Shh, he said. Shh. It's okay.I had a bad dream.I know.Should I tell you what it was?If you want to.I had this penguin that you wound up and it would waddle and flap its flippers. And we were in that house that we used to live in and it came around the corner but nobody had wound it up and it was really scary.Okay.It was a lot scarier in the dream.I know. Dreams can be really scary.Why did I have that scary dream?I don't know. But its okay now. I'm going to put some wood on the fire. You go to sleep.The boy didn't answer. Then he said: The winder wasnt turning.Simple, and easy to gloss over, but on reflection, this little vignette is terrifying in that it opens a window on a little boys fear of the unexplained, the inexplicable. And much of the world he inhabits, with his guardian father, goes unexplained. There are many answers to many questions, few of which provide any hope.So hope has to be made on the fly. Faith has to be lit and stoked from within.The boy sat tottering. The man watched him that he not topple into the flames. He kicked in the sand for the boy's hips and shoulders where he would sleep and he sat holding him while he tousled his hair before the fire to dry it. All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you've nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.And this, after the man had washed the boy's hair of the brains of a dead man who had tried to kidnap the boy from his father. Tried . . .Still, hope is hard to come by.They scrabbled through the charred ruins of houses they would not have entered before. A corpse floating in the black water of a basement among the trash and rusting duct-work. He stood in a livingroom partly burned and open to the sky. The waterbuckled boards sloping away into the yard. Soggy volumes in a bookcase. He took one down and opened it and then put it back. Everything damp. Rotting. In a drawer he found a candle. No way to light it. He put it in his pocket. He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.There is no triumph in such a world. Only pyrrhic victory and a dim candleflame of hope against the gale winds of decay. But there is, in the end, love and memory, which keep that dim flame lit until the last inch of wick is finally, quietly, consumed."

No animals, fish or birds, the ground is burnt and the trees are dying. Just a man and a boy walking along an eerily deserted road, scavenging for food, avoiding gangs of thugs who would steal from them or worse. Unable to help anyone else and knowing that they will probably die when no more tinned food can be found. But still there is love as they look out for each other and head south to the coast and there is also hope that they will find others like them and a future to fight for."

6288,28394432,it was amazing,"Wow. This may be one of the saddest books that I have ever read, yet I couldn't stop reading.Essentially, I've been hearing rumblings on the Internet now and again that McCarthy is the Faulkner of our age, so I grabbed this book haphazardly off the shelf from the library to give him a look.The premise of the book is pretty basic: a catastrophe has occurred and a father and son are trying to survive. One could assume that the catastrophe is of the nuclear bomb variety and that the setting is America, though this is never explicitly stated. One might also assume that this is never stated because the people remaining are either unaware of the details or else it is just not important anymore when faced with the bigger picture of day-to-day survival. The boy and his father are staying close to a road that is taking them South, as they believe that the warmer climate will eliminate that particular variable to their continued existence. Their most valuable possessions are a gun with two bullets in the chamber and a shopping cart. As they travel the road, the two major concerns are the search for food and the avoidance of other people. The reason to avoid others is because the disaster has caused humanity's worst face to show itself. Any stranger brings a high potential for harm. While the nicer ones may only take your possessions and leave you to certain death, there are others (that seem to travel in groups) that have a penchant for rape or cannibalism. There is a kind of melancholy inspiration that can be found here. The boy often echoes the words heard from his father that they are ""the good guys"" and ""keeping the fire"". What this means to me is that they choose to persist in maintaining their humanity and not degrading it like the marauding cannibal rapists or cashing out early like the boy's mother chose to do (which would be a tempting option for anyone in a similar situation).The prose of this book is also a curious thing. It is very sparse, almost to the point of being minimalistic. Basically, it is all scenery and dialog, with only the occasional glimpses into dreams or thoughts. I didn't think that I was going to like the writing style when I first began reading, but I am now of the opinion that it is crucial in making the story so effective. It forces the reader to become more engrossed in the microcosm that is the boy and his father. If we had been given all of the background behind the disaster, etc, I think it would have detracted from the story in the long run.My only possible complaint with this book is the way that the dialog is printed. The punctuation is also very sparse, and there are no real chapter divisions to speak of. Each paragraph is written as a block of text, and the dialog is printed within a block of text with a character's utterance starting a new indented line. There are no quotation marks and none of the "",said the boy"" business that readers are used to. This caused me to sometimes lose track during verbal exchanges between the father and son as far as who was saying what. At first I also thought that the dialog was too stilted and the characters were hollow. I then started reflecting on the things that people most often chat about, such as work, school, television shows and movies. In a world such as this, where a rusty can of peaches meant more than all of the movies one has ever seen, I'm pretty sure all of our dialog would become stilted rather quickly.Sadly, I found this to be totally believable for a post apocalyptic type novel. One only needs to look back at footage from New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina to realize that when the chips are down, human beings can get really ugly really fast. Although I loved this book, I wouldn't recommend reading it for anyone who is uncomfortable about getting all freaked out and then rushing to the grocery store to stock up on non-perishable food items. I'm going to have to look this up again, but wasn't this book on Oprah's list awhile back? If I'm correct about that, I am now totally intrigued by the prospect of how magnificiently awful it must have went over with the soccer mom demographic that we assume makes up a majority of her viewers."
6288,257990345,it was amazing,"Wow! I wasn't too sure about The Road going in. I've heard all the talk about the lack of punctuation, the confusing dialogue. As an English teacher, incorrect punctuation is usually offensive to me, but holy hell! I was completely ravished by this book! I love, love, LOVE post-apocalyptic stories (except the endless loop of recycled YA tropes that all end up with teenagers saving the world--yeah, right!). Interesting that so many of these books are massive tomes--The Stand, The Passage, Swan Song: great stories, all. Not one of them, not even my beloved Stand, managed to make me feel the gritty reality of what it might actually be like to survive in a post-apocalyptic world like The Road did, and in such a succinct format.I felt like the lack of punctuation actually reflects this world that Man and Boy live in, where the mundane structures we surround ourselves with no longer matter. That applies to the bleak prose, as well. Their world is so grey, so cold, so desolate--how better to express it than with such stark diction?I found the Boy's outlook interesting. I know he represents the good side of humanity, the qualities that used to abound (in some people) in the world that was no longer. I was still not quite convinced of his reactions to the people he met. I would have thought, having never known anything but the terrible, dangerous life of a survivor, that he would be mistrustful, suspicious, self-protective. Instead, he abounds with compassion and tolerance. Where does this come from? He's never really been around other people, from the sounds of it--he and his father spend all their time pretty much fleeing encounters with other people. The ones they do have are almost always unpleasant. I mean, it's not like the people they meet are just rude; they are actively trying to kill them. The child sees the cellar with the captured victims chained, awaiting their turn to be the entree of the day. He sees the horrifying sight of a newborn baby, butchered and spitted over a fire like a woodland animal. Still, he wants to invite strangers into their midst, share their precious food stores, even after being on the brink of starvation himself more than once, knowing that there is no guarantee they will find more. Even his father, his role model, the only person he can observe to learn behavior as children do, does not practice this generous acceptance. So . . . why? Is it just because he's so lonely and starved for human interaction that he's willing to risk death? Something to ponder!The ending, also, was just a little pat, but I'm willing to overlook that. It would have been more in keeping with the tone of the book if the convenient stranger had started pinching the boy's arm to see how much meat was on his bones--that's what I half-way expected! Still, I loved the book so much that I was willing to accept this hopeful ending.I don't know what my love for and fascination with these apocalyptic stories says about me. I mean, there are no good types of apocalypses where the world is overwhelmed with rainbows and fairies that grant wishes. Nope, just pestilence, nuclear detonations, and the undead. Oh, well, what can I say? I'm a ghoul, and I'm at peace with it! If you have ghoulish tendencies and can overlook some missing commas and apostrophes, I highly recommend this!"
6288,698301878,it was amazing,"This is one of my favorite books. It has its detractors, and of course, your mileage might vary, but here are a few quick observations about Cormac McCarthy's brilliant The Road. 1. This book made me cry. You've heard of the iceberg technique of storytelling? The one Hemingway championed? This book is the textbook example of it. The father-son relationship, which is absolutely the axis on which the entire novel turns, is so full of raw emotion and undying love and unwavering loyalty that it brings me to tears. And not so much by what the father and son say, but rather by what they don't say, and yet how clearly their emotions still resonate with the reader. I'd like to think that I'd behave like this dad if ever my son and I faced a situation this harrowing because, imperfect though the father might be, everything he does grows from his love of his boy. I admire that. And respect it deeply. There's an iceberg of love inside many of us men, even if one can't always see it. This book expressed that truth beautifully. 2. Folks sometimes get hung up on McCarthy's unique punctuation (or lack of punctuation) style. As though a writer of his abilities needs to resort to some stripped-down gimmick in some desperate attempt to garner attention. Okay, so maybe the no-quotation-marks thing isn't for you, and I can respect that, but let's be real here--McCarthy doesn't need to use gimmicks of any kind. He's a genius. And for me, the form of this novel is part of why it moved me so deeply. Each book is different, and each author must find the right voice, form, and style to express his or her ideas. In The Road (and other McCarthy books), his style reduces the distance between reader and character to the point where we can feel each one of the father's labored respirations. Our throats tighten with emotion and fear as we swing wildly from one extreme emotion to another. There are no impediments to our readerly intimacy. And again, McCarthy executes this beautifully. 3. Lastly, I should mention that I read The Road several years ago and have not gone back to it yet. But doesn't that illustrate just how powerfully it affected me? I'm writing about it now, and though I don't have a Matt Damonesque Good Will Hunting memory, I can remember vividly several moments from the novel. I remember many exchanges between father and son. I remember ash coating the ground like a newly-fallen scrim of snow. And I remember two horrific moments that gave me nightmares and haunt me still--one with something roasting over a fire and another one involving a horrible revelation in a basement. And that's where I'll end. The Road, in my earnest opinion, is a horror novel. Many of you will disagree with this assessment, perhaps because you see horror as a genre populated merely by vampires, werewolves, and masked serial killers. And while horror can feature those tropes, it can also be lyrical, heartfelt, and as literary as any other genre. The Road, of course, is all of those things, and it's damned frightening as well. Both in its plot and in its implications. It also happens to be one of the most loving and life-affirming books I've ever read, and I can think of few tales that more deserve a five-star rating. "

6288,2020395519,it was amazing,"""Nunca te enviarei sozinho para o ventre das trevas."" (p. 163)Num dado momento do livro de Blake Crouch, Matéria Escura, o personagem principal é transportado para um mundo de cinza, pós-guerra nuclear, com ""um pivete a queimado e a morte"". Não permanece lá mais do que breves minutos e continua a sua jornada à procura do seu mundo. Os personagens de A Estrada vivem num mundo equivalente a esse. O homem e o rapaz, pai e filho. Emaciados e sujos, têm como objectivos diários encontrar comida e água, e dirigir-se para sul com o seu carrinho. A luz do dia é pouca e à noite é impossível descortinar uma estrela sequer. Está sempre frio, não se vê um único animal e as árvores tombam com estrondo. Restos humanos surgem com frequência no seu percurso e, numa ou outra casa, vão encontrando alguns mantimentos que passaram despercebidos a outros.McCarthy conseguiu criar e transpor para o papel um autêntico pesadelo. Tão cedo não me esqueço da cena da página 132 desta edição."
6288,2158763756,it was amazing,"Cormac McCarthy is truly a literary genius. With a completely unique style, unconventionally developed yet very relatable characters and a situation that is both heartbreaking and intimate, The Road takes a somewhat tired post-apocalyptic genre and makes a very human story, both tragic and life affirming. Never before have I read a book so bleak. The oppression of the scorched landscape is a constant struggle both for the characters and the reader. I was actually slowed down, feeling my energy drained as book moved forward. However, this is countered by the loving, though never idealized, relationship between the unnamed father and son. Their love throughout the journey is the only source of light, even when strained by the harsh decisions need in the dead world. I'll be very careful who I recommend The Road to, and do suggest a steady stream of cartoons between reading sessions, but the reward of truly remarkable reading experience is well worth the pain of the journey."
6288,64768674,it was amazing,"The futility of continuing on for any purpose other than to express love, but that is enough, and so he does, with no hope of any reward other than that which he feels in the moment.Is it a fearful look into what McCarthy feels is a possible future? Is it an allegory for everyone's approach to what we know is certain death?Whatever McCarthy's purpose, which could well encompass both of the above and more, The Road is an utterly compelling read. The sparse sentences express emotion in so few words yet with such power. The absence of names makes the story universal. The only part that did not ring true for me was the ending. Why, among the possible choices, was this ending chosen? ... any thoughts on that?"
6288,1285846803,it was ok,"I don't think me and Cormac McCarthy get along very well. This is the second book of his I've read (blood meridian) that has sorely left me wanting some form of structured narrative, or just more of a story in general. The prose in this book is poetic in places. It's a real shame theres not a huge amount of story to back it up. The 'whys' of this book aren't answered, the man and the boy are referred to as such, no character names and the dialogue is the most annoying I've ever encountered:The boy ""I'm scared""The man ""It's okay""THE END!If this book was longer it might've warranted a four star. As it is, it feels like a bit of a short story."
6288,1809104956,it was amazing,This book broke my heart in ways I couldn't have imagined they existed. It has the most emotionally heartbreaking/warming love story between a father and his son I've ever come across in books.
6288,11417726,it was amazing,"This took me an embarrassing amount of time to read, and it's not that I didn't enjoy it, I just gave it the lowest priority out of two other books I'm reading at the same time. Not to be daunted by the jabs and subsequent emoticon ditto given to me for a review of another Oprah book I'll once again show that I'm not one to overlook the Queen of All Media and creator of literary tastes among the generally not-so-well read and hark once again on Oprah and her choices of books. This book makes no sense as an Oprah book, and it's sad in away that it is one, not sad in that boo-hoo I'm going to lose a favorite author to the masses kind of way, but because too many people who read this just because it is an Oprah book just don't deserve to read it. That's right, they don't deserve it and they will not realize that they are reading something truly great and moving, and just think they are reading some kind of staccato nonsense about a man and his boy walking around on a road and not really saying too much to each other. This book isn't for the uninitiated into the writing of Cormac McCarthy, I'm not sure what I would think of this book if I hadn't read most of his other books before this one. The same could be said of No Country for Old Men too though, both of these books have their strength in being beautiful while being held against the world he has created for his characters in books like Suttree and The Border Trilogy. In McCarthy's stoic world these books are probably about as close to an overflowing of emotion that one is going to find, and he puts that emotion quite subtly into the experiences of the boy and the child. He doesn't hark on it, just like he never seems to feel the need to really give the reader a real sense of what is going on in the world that these two characters are living in. The world is post-apocalyptic, but the reasons are never really given. Some really bad shit happened after whatever it is happened, but again the reader doesn't know exactly what that was. Why are they wearing pieces of cloth over their mouths sometime? Why did the tar on the road melt? Why did some people cut their fingers off? What sent the masses onto the road, something that was bad enough to scare the shit out of everyone, but not bad enough to kill them, and something that left people living on the road for years. The average reader I think will find the lack of answers annoying, but it's in the very slight clues and sparse flashback scenes that little tantalizing bits of information are given, and I think it was McCarthy's idea to leave it to the reader to fill in the blanks. Not because it's the lazy way out, but because the speculation and ultimate unknowing is more satisfying to the imagination while reading the book, then any answer and author could give. We've all read about the end of the world, there are even plenty of 'road' apocalypse books (like The Stand), and to get into the details of why the world ended and why all the crazy shit is going on ignores the central crux of the story, the relationship of two people , a father trying to raise his son in a world that is on it's death bed. There is a sense of futility to the book that's as if it came out of a Beckett novel, but unlike the characters of Beckett who are trapped most of the time in the absurdity of a lack of hope, McCarthy chooses to have his characters continue to slowly trudge on towards something better even if there is nothing better out there. This book isn't for everybody, and I can't imagine what it would be like coming to this novel after the generally melodramatic family stories that Oprah normally chooses for her readers, maybe it will be a good thing for them. I don't know. I'm running out of characters quickly, but I'll throw in my one pet theory of the novel, and I have no basis for this, but it's sort of how I saw the man when I read the book. The Man is Suttree. "
6288,29686637,did not like it,"I have read a lot of post-apocalyptic fiction and “The Road” by Cormac McCarthy is probably in a tie with “On the Beach” by Nevil Shute for the most depressing example of the genre ever written. It was so relentless that I was very surprised by the ending.As I was reading, I kept hearing Spencer Tracy’s voice narrating in my head the way he narrated the voice-over in the movie version of “The Old Man and the Sea.” In fact, within a couple of pages, I noticed a great similarity between McCormac’s style in “The Road” and Hemingway’s signature style. If anything, he’s even sparer than Hemingway. His words and sentences aren’t just short, the punctuation is even leaner. He doesn’t use any apostrophes for contractions and he doesn’t use any quotation marks for dialogue. He doesn’t even have chapters, just very frequent page breaks. The characters have no names, just “the man” and “the boy”. Sometimes, they are referred to as father and son. Let me state flat-out that I hate Hemingway. I suffered through a couple of his short stories and “The Sun Also Rises” only because I had to as an English lit major. However, I think McCarthy’s writing in “The Road” is effective. It fits the story of a father and son just trying to stay alive on a barren, devastated planet. I have to admit that I’m really torn on the ending. I can’t decide if it’s a cheat or not. It certainly was a twist and it raised more questions than it answered. I think it would have been more true to the narrative if it had ended differently. It almost seemed as if McCormac ran out of steam and just decided to end it. Despite the possibly flawed ending (and I’m still not sure it was flawed), I must shamelessly admit that it made me cry. If you decide to read “The Road”, I highly recommend that you have a humorous book on hand to start reading as soon as you finish. You’re going to need some humor when you’re done.I suppose I should also add my reasoning for only giving it three stars. While it does have a lot of critical acclaim and people really like this book, I didn't find it to be particularly creative. I've been down this road before in numerous post-apocalyptic books and films, many of which were done much better. I liked it, but I didn't love it and I definitely wasn't blown away by it."
6288,966046546,liked it,"This is a very dark book. It is a sort of a post- apocalyptic western told as a long, somewhat poetic nightmare. It is about a man and his son who survived the Apocalypse (some sort of a global fire, not many details are revealed) . They are waking up each day walking towards the South hoping to live another day. Why are they going south? The only reason stated in the book is the hope that it would be warmer. Every day they face death, starvation, disease, extreme cold, hopelessness. There is no long term goal, only the need to survive but not with all cost. The man and the child are „the good guys” and they are trying not to hurt other human beings even if sometimes it is impossible. The are constantly on the run from cannibals hordes that are hunting any survivor.All the world is grey, unknown, the toxic ash is everywhere. There are some glimpses in the past that offer slight information on how things came to be but not much. The prose is very repetitive, there are very few concrete details with not record of time. The repetitiveness might help to introduce the reader into the bleak, hopeless atmosphere but, in my opinion, does not make the book an attractive read. There is a lot of small conversation between the man and the boy which is almost the same every time. „We have to get going”, „Are you ok?”, „I’m ok”, “I’m scared”, “it’s ok, don’t be scared”. The dialog is not separately marked and you have to guess who is saying what. Not that it actually matters.I think that this repetitiveness of the banal dialogue and of some of the descriptions was the main thing that I did not enjoy about the book. I did not manage to care about the characters or to get involve in story. The language is poetic in some parts and there are some interesting abstract comments about life and death but otherwise it failed to impress me. All I felt was the cold. The author made a good job to make me feel cold all the time I was reading the book. That probably happened because the weather outside is also bleak and cold and in sink with the atmosphere of the book. I sort of feel guilty I did not like this book more as I know it is seen as a masterpiece. "
6288,1668745531,it was ok,"I joined a real life book club for the first time and THE ROAD was our book to read. I had never heard of it but I learned it had won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007 and in 2009 the book was adapted into a movie. I was pretty excited to know it had all these great accomplishments and we were going to read it. Unfortunately, for me, I was bored throughout the book. The story was one continuously long chapter that added to the feeling of dragging on. It was descriptively written which added to the essence of how bleak the world had become. While all that was well done it made me tired of reading about this world. I know this book was written a few years before the tv show The Walking Dead had started but I kept waiting for zombies to jump out and attack the two characters (a young son and a dad). No, there aren't any zombies in this book but it had that desperate how are we going to survive and keep the bad people away feel to it. Even though I'm in the minority in my thoughts about this book there are many articles that call it a 'masterpiece.' Those who like worst case scenarios and survival type books should give this one a try. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world with a boy and his dad relying on each other. Really it's a love story between a parent and a child.  How far would you go to protect your child if the apocalypse happened?STANDALONE

Esa descripción de un mundo post-apocalíptico envuelto en penumbra, hambre, desolación, canibalismo... ha sido agobiante. Hay cosas que no me gustaría concebir: ""Tal vez en su destrucción sería posible al fin ver cómo estaba hecho el mundo. Océanos, montañas. El fatigoso contraespectáculo de las cosas dejando de existir. La extensa tierra baldía, hidróptica y fríamente secular. El silencio.""Me parece que con esa descripción de escenarios y afmósfera y de ese amor entre padre e hijo, no han hecho falta más personajes, más dialogos, más historia. Un final desgarrador e interpretado desde nuestras más profundas creencias."
6288,563001643,did not like it,I suppose I'm just too impatient to be able to enjoy Mr. McCarthy's books or I picked a bad time to read it because from the beginning it just droned on and on without anything happening. I own another book by McCarthy that I plan to read in the future so maybe I'll have a better experience with that one.
6288,1764022557,it was amazing,"Hay libros de los que uno lee que, cuando se enfrenta al momento en que tiene que hablar sobre él, encuentra las palabras adecuadas, precisas, que lo describen a la perfección. Existen otros con los que ocurre algo opuesto: sabemos qué nos produjo pero ponerlo en palabras no es fácil. Y hay un tercer grupo de libros que, teniendo en cuenta que es hasta complicado explicarnos a nosotros mismos qué nos transmitió, más arduo será contárselo a otra persona. Por ende, acertar en los conceptos para describirlo será algo más complejo aún. La carretera se ubica en este último grupo. La premisa de la novela nos plantea un paisaje desolado, destruido por algo que no se sabe bien qué fue. Allí viven (mejor dicho, tratan de sobrevivir), un padre, el hombre, y su hijo, el chico. De ellos dos poco sabemos, ni siquiera sus nombres; solamente que la supervivencia es el único objetivo claro que tienen. Podría parecer que el argumento tiene poco de originalidad. Es probable que así sea. Pero a veces en las novelas no es necesario tener una gran cuota de originalidad si hay otros factores que hacen que la historia sobresalga de una manera especial. En el caso de La carretera, la clave está en cómo McCarthy puede contarla. En todo momento transmite el desamparo de los personajes, sus miedos, sus deseos, su tristeza; el hecho de permanecer juntos pase lo que pase. En ese paisaje sombrío, oscuro, inquietante y desesperanzador es donde ocurre todo. Decir ""todo"" puede dejar entrever que en la historia pasan muchas cosas, de esas que nos hacen sorprender, esos giros de trama. Mentiría si dijera que en La carretera pasa eso. En esta novela, los hechos son, de alguna manera, predecibles. Los personajes buscan comida, la encuentra, no la encuentran, caminan, paran a descansar, divisan personas, se escapan. Lo que podría pasar en cualquier novela postapocalíptica. Pero reitero, lo central en esta historia no es lo que pasa, sino la genial habilidad que tiene el autor para lograr que lo que sienten los personajes nos llegue. En todo momento, mientras leía, preponderó en mí un sentimiento que se me hace muy difícil describir con claridad. Las palabras quizás más adecuadas para definirlo serían algo así como miedo, intranquilidad, nervios, perturbación. Es una mezcla de todo eso. ¿No son los buenos libros los que nos hacen sentir?La novela no da respiro en ningún momento. No solo porque lo que pasa es atractivo para el lector, porque por lo menos para mí, siempre es atrayente leer sobre mundos distópicos (bien construidos, gracias), sino porque el autor tiene una forma de narrar que, literalmente, no deja que respiremos. Habitualmente, cuando uno enumera una lista de cosas, o de acciones, las separa con comas, y recién une la penúltima y la última acción con una ""y"". Parece que McCarthy no se guía por las reglas normales de puntuación, y opta por dejar a un lado las comas y unir todo con yes. Esto genera que la lectura se haga mucho más vertiginosa y no nos deje tomar aliento en ningún momento; porque de hecho, las comas son las que nos permiten hacer esto, son pausas no tan prolongadas como los puntos pero pausas al fin. Entonces, esta manera de encadenar los hechos junto con las acciones que se describen, hacen de La carretera una novela que, si uno se engancha rápido en ella, se puede leer en unas horas. El hecho de haber tardado ocho días en terminarla no da cuenta de esto, ya que en un principio sí me costó un poco acostumbrarme a la historia y a la prosa del autor, pero una vez que me adapté, la lectura fluyó con total naturalidad. La carretera es una novela que me encantó no solo por el tema que trata y por lo que consigue transmitir el autor, sino porque también da lugar a reflexiones sobre nuestra vida cotidiana, la relación que tenemos con los otros, la supervivencia y el valor que le damos a nuestra existencia."
6288,1939155966,really liked it,"For its own genre (post-apocalypse) it is very strongly written - it is a Pulitzer winner anyway. It could show fears and emotions, horrors and crimes, hopes and despairs and many other human existential concerns very well. Especial language. Short sentences with sometimes no verb, short conversations between the father and the boy (who are unnamed). Descriptions of the ruined nature and planet earth were so precise that I could see them in pictures in my mind very easily. The good and the bad people and the father's prophetic inspirations. All in all, the subject was a little repetitive for me, I could relate it to Saramago's The Blindness and O'Connor's realistic and hard stories written in Hemingway's style but it was worth a read."

6288,16741384,it was amazing,"In his latest novel, The Road, Pulitzer-prize winning author Cormac McCarthy chronicles the journey of a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, where everything that made the world a beautiful place has been destroyed. Lacking civilization, the only ones that remain are victims of the unknown catastrophe desperately searching for salvation (the good guys) and those who have converted into cannibalism, victimizing passersby, to stay alive (the bad guys). The Road is a remarkably written novel, engaging the reader in a world of despair and hopelessness with language arranged so elegantly, it leaves images in your mind you never would have dreamed of.The father and son, both unnamed and without age, are suffering from starvation, the suicide of a wife and mother, and winter’s frigid weather. They embark on a journey to reach the southeastern United States, in order to have a chance at life in a warm climate, with the knowledge that they may not be able to survive the winter. The father is devoted to keeping his son safe from attack and somewhat adequately nourished while trying to avoid thoughts of his wife’s death that seem to haunt both him and the son throughout the story. They find abandoned carts and houses full of food, but not without consequence. Human remains are scattered all over the landscape and the child has seen so much more than any adult in our world has likely ever witnessed. Despite having a childhood tainted with such gruesomeness, the son seems to be certain there exists some kind of ethical humanity beyond the melancholic road they are traveling.As a student with grammatical and mechanical rules embedded into my brain, I couldn’t help but cringe at the run-on, punctuation-less sentences; but as a lover of words and the power that they hold, I put my years of English class knowledge behind me and embraced the fantastic imagery. The world McCarthy creates is so dreary that when he refers to “dead limbs” in the woods, one cannot be sure whether he means broken tree branches or human extremities. He paints such a dull, gloomy life that even the snowflakes, one of nature’s most beautiful and intricate creations, are gray from the ash covering the earth.McCarthy makes us wonder what our own lives would be like post-apocalypse. He forces us to question ourselves: Would I be able to survive? Would I have the strength to bear all the things that they have endured? There are no laws, no rules to live by, no sense of order in that world. The only true form of currency is the heartache those who are still alive feel for their past, present, and future.At first, I thought the only shortcoming of this novel lay in the conversation between father and son. The age of the son is unknown, though it is a common conception that he between six and eight years old. Repetitive and monotonous, I initially considered the dialogue hard to accept as realistic between a father and a child of that age. The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to believe that the exchanges of words were a mere representation of the world they lived in, which is exactly that: repetitive and monotonous. I suppose in a life after the apocalypse, there is nothing left to say. All the stories have been told, all questions have been asked, all memories have been recalled.McCarthy’s choice of words in The Road create graphic and disturbing images in your mind. He describes a house filled with human bodies, both dead and barely alive, kept hostage by cannibalistic maniacs. He goes into great detail about the bodies strewn about, burned alive in their final resting place. Though his imagery bordered terrifying at times, what upset me the most was the colossal fear and desperation that lead the father to hand his son a pistol and tell him to commit suicide if the bad guys found him. “If they find you you are going to have to do it. Do you understand? Shh. No crying. Do you hear me? You know how to do it. You put it in your mouth and point up. Do it quick and hard. Stop crying. Do you understand?” The idea of that tore through me; I couldn’t wrap my mind around such a horrific experience for a child. For a novel in which nothing major occurs or is accomplished, The Road has a stunning way of keeping the reader engaged. It is simply a story of a journey for a father and son who are just trying to stay alive. Cormac McCarthy truly has a gift for language and creates a world for the reader he or she never would have imagined. The fluidity of words makes for a graceful storytelling of the unconscionable. While The Road offers a dark, gloomy post-apocalyptic tale that is nothing short of depressing, the beautiful vocabulary and imagery are what makes it so difficult to put down. I recommend this novel to those who are intrigued by language, and take time to think about life in ways they have never before.~ wrote this for class"
6288,1566426000,it was amazing,"I've always been a bit afraid to read The Road. From the movie, I knew it was a very bleak depressing story of a post apocalyptic world. Even though I'm a fan of this genre, I wasn't sure I wanted to revisit such a hopeless world.I was amazed to discover a very profound story of the love between a father and son.

Reviews and morehttps://edwardsghostengine.wordpress....So, I’m not quite sure what i was expecting when I went into this one, perhaps a detailed, violent and harrowing plot. Really the only one I had was harrowing because oh boy, there were feels at the end…Anyway, this book is basically one long journey featuring a father and son walking through a post apocalyptic America in an attempt to find warmer climates as a cold winter is setting in. The first problems I can think of with this book is the fact that there’s hardly any flashback to the characters pasts and there’s no description of how the world became that way. For me these things spoiled my liking of the book immensely. What was the boy’s mother like? How exactly did she die? What were the character’s lives like before the apocalypse? If these things had even hints towards them it would have made the novel deeper for me.That leads me onto something else. None of the characters in the book had names, they were simply referred to as son, papa, the woman. the old man etc. This was one of the things I did like because by stripping the characters of their identities it also stripped them of a kind of personality making them mysteries in themselves and allowing readers to picture them and their personalities in their own ways. That was well done and well suited for this type of book I thought, but still would have liked more background history on the world at least.There was a lot less action and violence than what I was expecting. I would say in terms of violence and action this is a rather tame book, but there were a few disturbing scenes involving cannibalism and such which were vividly described. The writing style was also something I thought was well done as the landscape and the characters feelings were so well brought to life it made me feel as if I were on the road myself (this book certainly tainted me with its depression as I felt rather down when reading this, but there again the snowy weather I had recently probably didn’t help).So, this was quite a well written book with a good medium speed pacing and a very well descried landscape. I will also mention I managed to get through this book quite quickly even though I thought there could have been more action and run ins with outcasts. But there again this book was probably intended to be about the journey and the relationship between father and son in the most harshest of situations. The ending was a bit too abrupt for me and it was left open because to me I didn’t know whether the boy was in good hands at the end or not or whether he’d fall victim to cannibalism later… oh these type of endings frustrate me! But what happened to them both before the end….. FEELS!! IT EVEN MADE ME FUCKING CRY IN THE END!!! Oh I hate it when that happens :P :/"
6288,38042222,did not like it,"This was the SciFi selection for the Goodreads SciFi and Fantasy Book Club for the month of February 2009. Visit this link to see all of the discussions, group member reviews, etc.This review contains spoilers, but at least read this far: don't read this book. 
This book is vile. This book is a lie. It is a festering wasteland of despair and sadistic pathos pretending to contain some freakish remnant of love.
A father and son stumble through a dead killing land in the empty hope that life might actually survive at some coastline to the south.Something has killed everything but humans, leaving the unlucky survivors to rot away in a hell of starvation and scavenging and the constant dread of roving bands of cannibals.The death that has turned the world gray has apparently killed the birds, the fish and every single plant though hundreds of miles of trudging, many years after the cataclysm -- and every corpse mummifies, so perhaps even the microbes and fungi are dead? Yet wounds can still fester and old food goes bad.So this must be somehow allegorical -- but what awesome hopelessness is McCarthy trying to illuminate? This is a story of humans that have become the walking dead. McCarthy and his characters have apparently confused the will to survive and sustain some pitiful remnant of decency as if it is meaningful and a reason to persist in a supremely hopeless existence.The author is a mighty craftsman with his prose, and the story is haunting -- but the final result is a foul nightmare, best forgotten."
6288,1909499921,it was amazing,"Few things can encapsulate both the abject and sublime--but this does.This is definitely one of those books where less is more. The writing is concise, almost to the point of being terse. There is space between the words and contained within it is more emotion than you could imagine. I have not felt this level of distillation since reading Hemingway.This is bleak, dark, and relentless. It is also pulls you forward. There's no stopping. You're on the road. The pacing is wonderful. It's a constant surge of the sea against you as you read. Riding one up one wave and plummeting down the trough. At some point, you think the sea will calm, that you'll have a moment to catch your breath, but it just pulls you, throws you. 
Take my hand. I don't want you to see this.What you put in your head is there forever?Yes.It's okay Papa.It's okay?They're already there.I don't want you to look.They'll still be there.

6288,15630106,it was amazing,"This is a book about the moral standing of Earth. I don’t care what you say about it, the harrowing romantic tale of two people lost in the post-apocalyptic wilderness; granted. But it does not stop there. It is about so much more. It is a spectacular novel and it is extremely sad. Not only because of its bleak content and its hollowness, but because of its hinting towards a depravity that could not be written about fully, because it has yet to be understood. This acknowledgement of a future with so little hope that it can be counted by the heads of two lonely people, well its too overwhelming to be realized by civilization so far.To start off though, this dude mccarthy is a mind bending brilliant auteur, so strategically careful with his placement, but also so casual. He is so knowledgeable, but he doesn’t piss it all out like a giant of encyclopedic knowledge. His characters give impressions of being strong, sturdy central characters with a great idea about the world about them and most of all a strong keen idea about survival. That is the brilliance of his main characters, blue-collar, seemingly anonymous overmen. The good-willed nobodys who would survive the apocalypse. But there is not this burrowing gravity that lingers there either, dramatizing the strong rational directness of these brilliant men. They get caught up in the same Godotian nonsense that plagues everyone’s waking life, only in this nonexistence that suddenly has become:In a discussion about crows flying to Mars: What if they tried and they got half way or something and then they were too tired. Would they fall back down?Well. They really count get half way because they’d be in space and there’s not any air in space so they wouldn’t be able to fly and besides it would be too cold and they’d freeze to death.Oh.Anyway they wouldn’t know where Mars was.Do we know where Mars is?Sort of.If we had a spaceship could we go there?Well. If you had a really good spaceship and you had people to help you I suppose you could go.Would there be food and stuff when you got there?No. There’s nothing there.Oh.They sat for a long time. The book has a pulse being strangled. Two people dying, straight dying trying to travel cross country, plagued by a civilization completely destroyed: There was a lingering odor of cows in the barn and he stood there thinking about cows and he realized they were extinct. Was that true? There could be a cow somewhere being fed and cared for. Could there? Fed what? Saved for what? A lover of nature visualizes the holocaust of nature and mans subsequent holocaust when all forms of regeneration are cut off. People go insane. The man protecting his child creates this archetype of good guys versus bad guys (which is basically characterized pending on cannibalism) and is their main justification for surviving. They are the good guys, “This is what the good guys do. They keep trying. They don’t give up.” The bleakness of the book is characterized by simple, resolute statements about the end of civilization. They find a can of coca-cola and he gives it to the boy. Drink it slow, he says. This is going to be the last time I have one of these, isn’t it, the boy asks. Yes, the man says. The statements made are hidden, but they are incredibly dense with the missing hope that is so much taken advantage by in our copious successful civilization. What is a planet without god, “Where men can’t live gods fare no better.”The boy is a harbinger of guilt, an outdated cause. Survival by monkeys without a preternatural sense of survival, all that exists is the monolith of anger from 2001. What is catharsis? Emotional realizing in literature. This book is the desert of catharsis. Starving, bleak, and barely alive. It’s only points of clarity are as dry as a sweltering nothing: ”Okay.”“I thought so.”“I’m sorry.” And there is a menacing refreshment of the memories that come to haunt the man, remembering what civilization was and how or why God punished (or for that matter man punished himself) with the onslaught of a horrible de-civilization in which man has denigrated to worse than primitive form, either eating his brethren or raping or defiling him for no other purpose other to instate some form of the hierarchy lost to the evaporation of the social contract, and the defamation of anything resembling sanity: Standing at the edge of a winter field among rough men. The boy’s age. A little older. Watching while they opened up the rocky hillside ground with pick and mattock and brought to light a great bolus of serpents perhaps a hundred in number. Collected there for a common warmth. The dull tubes of them beginning to move sluggishly in the cold hard light. Like the bowels of some great beast exposed to the day. The men poured gasoline on them and burned them alive, having no remedy for evil but only for the image of it as they conceived it to be. The burning snakes twisted horribly and some crawled burning across the floor of the grotto to illuminate its darker recesses. As they were mute there were no screams of pain and the men watched them burn and writhe and blacken in just such silence themselves and they disbanded in silence in the winter dusk each with his own thoughts to go home to their suppers.

6288,2245351961,it was amazing,What a lachrymose tale! The Desolate post-apocalyptic landscape matched McCarthy's laconic prose so perfectly. 
6288,322863861,really liked it,"Having given out 25 copies of 'A Tale of Two Cities' for World Book Night on April 23rd I then received a copy of 'The Road' from someone else in the same system. Having never read this before I was pleased to pick it up and know that, hopefully, I was one of the first links in a long chain for this book as it gets passed from hand to hand and maybe country to country over the years ahead. The idea of the fellowship and community aspect to Bookcrossing is one I find wonderful, a sharing in the love of books and of reading; enabling others to draw strength and perhaps experience new ideas and reflections, enabling someone to force their way through scary undergrowth and stumbling out onto a whole new prairie set for exploration. This is what World Book Night is all about and the supreme irony was not lost on me that the book I get to read is one in which that new vista of experience encountered is one of hopelessness and ashen destruction and isolation.This book is extraordinary. The story is superficially simple in its telling but cavernous in the chasms and horrors that open out as you stumble with the unnamed man and his son through a world totally destroyed in living memory by some horrendous cataclysm. The disaster hangs across the narrative not only in the corpses and destruction and burnt out civilization that the characters encounter but simply by the ash and smoke and stinking clouds which hang over everything, blocking out the sun, enshrouding everything with a paralyzing greyness and chill. The simplicity and starkness of the language, the repetition and shortness of the sentences, the inability of the man to fully communicate with his son, the continual circling of their conversation seemingly over the same tired subjects is incredibly powerful i found. Society has broken down into a simple need to survive, the ability to communicate beyond these needs withers on the vine. Cannibalism is rampant and though the father promises his son they would never indulge he is unable to prevent others even to the extent of fleeing what is in effect a larder of live humans or encountering the charring body of a new born baby who only the day earlier we had seen still in the protection of its mother's womb. This horror is described coldly and all the more horrifying for that. Fear results in pointless attacks, kill or be killed and the man responds in defense of the son he adores and yet who he recognizes continually throughout the narrative is slowly moving out of his reach; not just physically but because the shared experience they have is so circumscribed by hopelessness and the man's prior knowledge of birdsong and sunlight and safety are fairy stories the boy will grow out of as he sinks deeper into the ashen world through which he is forced to wade.Yesterday I read a fascinating thread on another person's review of this book from 2007. The whole debate ranting back and forth bouncing off symbolism and allegory and reality. One thing that struck me as i read the discussion was how the arguers seemed to refuse to allow works of literature to have lives of their own. One of the strengths of literature for me has always been that a book is given to be read but wherever it takes you, whatever it inspires or draws forth from you is a valid reaction. The book, in that sense, has a life of its own. It is, of course, perfectly sensible to seek to fathom what the writer was intending but whether McCarthy did write this as an allegory of death and dying or of compassion over survival or wrote it as a story of aimless hopelessness or as a footnote to his wider work. All these questions and interpretations are valid surely if what it does is make you think. I am not a writer myself but i can only suppose that whatever his over-riding intention in composing this work was, the lights it succeeds in turning on or indeed off in the lives and thoughts of others is an enormous credit for him in any literary league table.A continual refrain of the man and his son was of they're being good guys, the carriers of the fire; towards the end the man sees the boy framed with a lightness which gives him a final hope. 'Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again'. The story can never be seen as a hope-filled one but it seems to hint in whispered tones at its end that the human spirit is one in whch love, if not necessarily triumphant, will at least survive. In amidst all the horror and degradation and vicious brutality a choice can be made, that choice can be to love, to pity, to protect and thus to pass on the spark of goodness which is indestructible. "
6288,17435599,it was amazing,"To be printed in the March 27 edition of Coastal View News:With a dearth of adornment and minimal superfluous dialogue in “The Road,” Cormac McCarthy pulls readers and co-travelers into the depths of the darkest hell with only a pinprick of light as reprieve. This narrow beam of light, of hope, appears so dim that it threatens to be extinguished at any instant, but with beauty and clarity, McCarthy rests the fate of mankind on that pinprick, and in doing so produces a work of art in “The Road.”A nameless father and his son wheel an old shopping cart over a vacant road, through a smoldering volcano of a world—a world that has been utterly destroyed by something that is not explicitly revealed, but which was surely caused by humankind. Not more than two sentences into the story, McCarthy lays the setting: “Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before.” This father and his boy have been traveling for an unknown period of time toward the American coast, the object of their journey, without having any clue what hope this destination might hold for them.There are few people left in this post-apocalyptic world, and most that are still alive are vicious cannibals—the bad guys. In contrast, the boy and his father are “the good guys,” or so they hope, somehow attempting to strike a delicate balance between survival and goodness. The father is primarily concerned with their survival and the son is primarily concerned with their goodness. In a dying world that is being destroyed by thieves, murders and eaters of mankind, goodness is the only reason to survive for this nearly defenseless pair. As the ashy filth blankets them more fully each and every step, the boy and his father struggle to stay pure. “You are not the one who has to worry about everything,” said the father to his son, referring to the means of survival. “Yes I am … I am the one,” responded the boy, referring to the means of goodness.The matured and life-worn father knows there is little or nothing to hope for. “He saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable.” But the boy, naïve and perhaps unrealistically idealistic, “was all that stood between him and death.” The relationship between father and son and the power of hope between them takes on a new, ontologically real form. Hope and goodness become more than just ideas, they become real entities. To the father, his son is the literal embodiment of hope, goodness and faith. “He knew that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke.”Despite an awareness of the feeble light glowing in his son, the father is continually tempted to succumb to the darkness—to give in to hopeless immorality, to play the game of survival common to the rest of the world, to call it quits, to commit suicide. Yet, the boy, who repeatedly asks “Are we still the good guys?” is a thread with just enough fiber to cling to.On this journey through a destitute America, McCarthy not only speaks to the future, but also to the present condition of mankind. What is a person to hope for, to look to, amidst so much evil? In “The Road,” McCarthy rarely steps out from behind his characters, but when he does it is a clue to what he is attempting to communicate in this story. The first striking example of this communication comes in the beginning: “All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one’s heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes.” The son, who was technically born after the apocalyptic cataclysm, becomes the father’s symbol of beauty born from the devastation, like a phoenix rising from its own ashes. The second and perhaps only other example of direct thematic communication comes at the very denouement of the story, and carries a message so powerful that it should stick with a reader for a very long time.“The Road” is a stroke of darkest genius from a Nietzchean soul. But whereas Nietzsche sees only darkness, McCarthy sees that pinprick of light in humanity that may be just enough to live by. “Goodness will find the little boy. It always has. It will again.”"
6288,2017245091,it was amazing,"The Road is a short and powerful post-apocalyptic novel. Bleak and disturbing on many levels and so emotional at the same time. I will never complain again that there is nothing to eat in the house when there is actually nothing I want to eat in the house. We forget how truly blessed we are most days. This book is a swift kick in the tookus to make you remember.This novel centers around a nameless man and his boy who are fighting to survive an unimaginable catastrophe. They are the ""good guys"" left in a sad, grey, world where survival means finding food and shelter while staying a step ahead of the ""bad guys"". The man and his love for his son is a thing of beauty in this cruel and sometimes gruesome story. A true story of a parents' role as protector, provider and teacher.You may find this story hard to stomach and digest. I told a friend I felt hollowed out and was a weepy mess at the end of The Road. I truly was. Early in the story, the man tells the boy that ""you forget what you want to remember and remember what you want to forget"". I may want to forget parts of this book, but I don't see that happening any time soon."
6288,2009962781,it was amazing,"Brilliant, bleak, and overpoweringly beautiful."
6288,230996646,it was amazing,"Opening Sentence: “…When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he’d reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him…”Like many of Ophra’s picks The Road is full of angst and gloom. But I didn’t choose it because it was one of her picks, in fact when she announced it as her pick I toyed with not reading it – as so many of her picks are so depressing and hard to read. I also ordered it from the library long before it was even announced as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, so I didn’t pick it because of that. No, I chose The Road because I am on the New York Times Notable Book Challenge and it was on the list for notable books for 2006.So is it worth all the hype? Oh yes, I really think so. The end of the world has occurred. The landscape is burnt, no animals, no birds, no fishes, and very few people. There is a man and his young boy – very young – his mother died after the end of the world – she was pregnant with him at the time. The two ‘heroes’ start nowhere in particular, and seem to have no aim in mind as they journey along the road – just heading south and to the sea. We never learn what the man expects to find when he reaches his destination, or even what his destination might be. The story is just a snapshot of their life, starting on page one and finishing at the end. The Man and the child spend their time hiding from the “bad” people. These are people, mostly men, who will kill you and eat you. People have become food on the hoof so to speak. As the food ran out – humans became the only source. The little boy is convinced that there must be other good people, but the man is certain there isn’t. As they travel through the burnt out landscape, they forage for any cans of food that may have escaped discovery over the previous few years. They meet a few people, most of which either try to kill them, or try to steal from them. They do help one person, but the man leaves him behind to the little boys’ distress.There is no punctuation – my pet hate – BUT as humans and the set parameters that life exists in breaks down – what is the use of punctuation? There will be no-on around to care.Despite the fact you learn precious little about these two characters they are very real, and through their eyes you witness the death of humanity, the breakdown of society, the struggle for survival in a world that no longer sustains human life.Is there any hope, any point in reading the book? Well, there is always hope. And when one door closes, then sometimes another door opens. The book is well written, evocative and thought provoking. It will scare you, make you disagree, and then wonder if there could be any truth. We all like to think we are civilized people. But take our civilization away and what will we become?So the answer to the previous question is yes, read The Road, you may hate it, you may wonder what the fuss is, but some of you may just end up being as awed as I was."

“¿En qué difiere el nunca será de lo que nunca fue?”
El mundo ha sido reducido a cenizas por lo que parece haber sido un holocausto nuclear. No sabemos a ciencia cierta qué lo motivó, pero eso tampoco importa. Bajo esta premisa y sumidos en un panorama por demás desolador y cruel, un padre y su hijo emprenden un viaje a pie nada convencional. Se dirigen hacia el sur, donde suponen hallarán “salvación”, lo que quiera que ello signifique.
“Tiempo prestado y mundo prestado y ojos prestados con que llorarlo”.
Es así como empieza una intensa historia sobre la relación de un padre y su hijo, que bien podría ser la relación de cualquier padre e hijo que se enfrentan al terror y la desesperanza más crudas. Juntos van sorteando una serie de eventos brutalmente inhumanos (amenazas de bandas caníbales, clima hostil y el hambre que arrecia con los días). 
“Donde los hombres no pueden vivir a los dioses no les va mucho mejor”.
La narrativa de McCarthy tiene de lapidaria lo que poseen de bárbaros los vestigios de esta civilización.He leído este libro sin un ápice de intriga, pero sin poder detenerme hasta que lo terminé porque yo al igual que los protagonistas quería asir en mi alma la certeza de que sin importar la adversidad de las circunstancias ese vínculo filial se sobrepondría ante la infamia y la muerte. Y sí, puede que suene cursi, pero les aseguro que no es una historia-sensiblera-postapocalíptica más. Mi único reparo quizá sea que las descripciones ambientales del autor aunque son muy ricas, pueden tornarse algo monótonas (Ajá sí, mira nos quedó claro que hace frío y hay cenizas por dondequiera). Por eso creo que durante toda la lectura no salía de mi mente la idea de que es una historia más cinematográfica que literaria, y eso su vez confiere un gran mérito a este escritor.¡No puedo creer que hayan transcurrido ya 10 años desde la publicación original de esta magnífica novela y yo no supe de ella sino hasta el año pasado! Estoy muy agradecida con la persona que me la recomendó. Me alegra haber iniciado el año con una lectura tan satisfactoria.

6288,2379332086,really liked it,"What to say about this book that has not been said already? Hmmm . . . it seems everything has been said already. I walk alone with my son. The sky is gray, the cold penetrates the shabby rags that were once nice clothes, and the road is covered in dust. I have not seen any living creature as long as I remember, except for some that I'd rather forget even existed. Humans, the evil ones. In my heart, I know that I'm going to die. Heck, chances are my son is going to die with me. But deep inside, inexplicably, I hold on to hope. It's not just an instinct to survive, it's hope. My son and I, we are the good ones, the fire-keepers. If only he would not be so naive, I would feel better about dying. I often think back to my wife, and how life once was. Was taking her life and trying to kill our son really the easier choice? What a drastic change. To say that everything is fucked-up would be an understatement. But this stupid hope keeps me going . . . all the way to the coast. There must be something better than this, there must be some place where the brutality has not devoured humanity. I think about the baby, the cellar, the hunters. They are so much stronger than us, but I will not descend into hell and eat my fellow men. No, I'd rather die. Must keep walking. The road is long. In all honesty, I'm not a fan of dystopian, post-apocalyptic literature. But this book has a lot going on for itself. The prose is tight, the language is good, and it is hauntingly realistic. At times too realistic."
6288,36293631,liked it,"A masterpiece of spare literary horror, as if a Beckett/Faulkner monstrosity had written a novelization of Night of the Living Dead, minus the humor and with less of the social commentary. (Regarding the absence of humor - I saw some humor in one passage regarding a ""mae west floating in the seepage"", which I initially saw in my mind's eye as an inflatable sex doll in dirty water, which would be humor of the black sort, but then I found out that a ""mae west"" is an inflatable life jacket.) I spent the majority of this book totally unmoved by what was calculated to move me, that is the father son relationship did not flutter my heart, in fact I viewed it as little more than a pre-calculated sensitive heart stringy prop like you see in many horror flicks. I also took issue with the good people/bad people dichotomy as being too pat and easy, ditto the absence/idealization of women. But then I was very moved by the ending. Somehow it seemed more authentic. And the final paragraph left me in awe.I don't entirely trust McCarthy. I have a suspicion that his last two books were actually written with movies in mind, a kind of aging novelist's 401-K. And I'm yet to consider him an indisputable Modern Master; though my personal verdict is not yet in, I have a feeling Suttree will put my socks on my hands and my underwear over my head and send me jibbering through the river dregs seeking a splayed mae west."

Where's the beef?
 As Arlo Guthrie Jr. says in Alice's Restaurant ""...it kind of starts out slow & then fizzles out altogether."" And so it went.I've wanted to read this for some time now. This was supposed to be right up there with the classics in post-apocalyptic SF, but I knew McCarthy had an aversion to punctuation, an unforgivable sin. I don't even insist on proper punctuation since I'm not sure myself, but an honest attempt should be made. Leaving it out on purpose is the mark of the artistic poseur trying to obscure their deficiencies. American & English spelling is weird enough that leaving apostrophes out of contractions is ridiculous, even sadistic. ""Cant"" & ""can't"" are both fine words with completely different meanings & a reader shouldn't have to waste energy differentiating between them. Knowing this about McCarthy's writing thanks to the reviews of my GR friends, I never even attempted to read it in paper or ebook. I'd have just abandoned it in disgust & listening to it as an audio book removed these issues. The narrator was quite good supplying the proper punctuation through his craft, thankfully.Unfortunately, the writing wasn't very good. I don't ever want to read ""OK"" or ""I don't know."" in dialogue again. I adore well phrased allusions, but McCarthy's were often twaddle. What the hell is 'autistic dark'? What am I even supposed to make of 'vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings'? I know all the words, but they evoke no more meaning or feel than the ravings of a syphilitic monkey. Not all were that bad & I was able to focus on the story, but...The story was pointless depression punctuated by moments of horror. I never found out what the apocalyptic event was, so the end was only slightly uncertain, a cheap shot. I don't mind uncertainty or even a depressing ending. On the Beach, A Canticle for Leibowitz, & Earth Abides all got high marks from me, although I have to say I preferred Alas, Babylon more. This book had all the depression of On the Beach & an even more ridiculous faith than A Canticle for Leibowitz without any of their redeeming features & shouldn't really be compared to any of them. It is not in the same class at all.A classic of post apocalyptic fiction needs to make some sense. Here we have no reason for it nor hope of redemption. I might as well have masturbated in sand - no payoff, just pointless pain. I'd warn everyone away from this, especially in any sort of print. As an audio book, I made it all the way through, but it's hours I could have spent listening to a good book."
6288,1698679891,it was amazing,"Miloš, my son, I want to thank you for so many things. It will be years before you read this. Probably not until I am gone and you are sifting through the internet looking for scraps of me -- either to scream at or take comfort in -- but you will find this, I know it, and I am speaking to you from this hot July night, across however many years have passed, to tell you that I loved you deeper than blood, deeper than the parental bond. You are my hero. Everything about you fills me with awe. Your art blows my mind. Your athleticism is beautiful to behold. Your kindness and maturity constantly humble me. Your hair is glorious. Your imagination is ineluctable. The control you have of your temper, your ability to find calm when your storms are brewing, eclipses anything I could ever approach. Your passion for the smallest things is inspiring. And somehow we have become more than son and father. We have become friends. And that is the greatest stroke of luck I have ever experienced. So imagine what it means to me to have been given -- by you -- the opportunity to read The Road aloud. Every syllable of McCarthy's book is infused with love between the man and the boy, and you shared it with me, night after night, curled up in the red light of my head lamp, even though the nights are too hot in the summer and the girls were clamouring to get to bed. Yet once I started reading, the whole world that is melted away, and we found ourselves in that terrible, awful, seemingly inevitable world that will be, but there we were with each other, being reminded night after night that the fire is love, and we have it for each other because we let it in, we let it be. Soon you will grow older and you will drift away from me, but I will carry nights like tonight, nights when our tears were shared over the fate of the boy and the man, in my heart and mind until death, and maybe then, when my star stuff is returned to the universe, you will find this letter and read it one night (maybe even the night you finish reading this book to one of your children), and you will remember our love for one another, and you will be back in your childhood home as if you never left, and you will remember the hope of the fire that lifts The Road up beyond seeming hopelessness, and you will remember why we go on, and you will know that you were the greatest friend I ever had. I love you, Miloš. You are a beautiful being. You have the fire. And you are my fire. I hope your life, when you read this, is as wonderful as mine is because of you right now. Kiss the ones you love, my son, and know that you have always been loved yourself. Love, Me"

Clearly, I have now finished it. It was bleak and desolate but I loved the man and the boy and so desperately wanted them to be OK, whatever OK might mean in their situation."

I just couldn't put it down.I appreciate that this seems to be a ""marmite"" book: people either really like it or they hate it - and I fell into the first camp, definitely.There's a hypnotic, elegiac, one-note meditative feeling about the prose, that drew me along that Road with nameless ""man"" and ""boy"". Their small victories, their hellishly hard day to day drag, the too-rare moments of glory when they come across an unpillaged store of supplies, the brief but always-catastrophic punctuations of meeting with other people (with the hope that once, just once, they might be friendly).The man's hoplessness always translated into optimism, for the boy's sake. Bringing the boy up right, in a world where ""right"" no longer really exists.We're never told what happened to the world, or how long ago it happened, and that adds to the feeling of dropping into this world.And the ""nature"" writing, if you can call it that when nature to all intents and purposes is gone. Is among the most beautiful and attentive that I've read in years.A definite 5* from me."

“Listen to me, he said, when your dreams are of some world that never was or some world that never will be, and you're happy again, then you'll have given up. Do you understand? And you can't give up, I won't let you.”
Well, this was a rough read that will keep me thinking for a while. The Road is one of those stories that works more than one level. You have a post-apocalyptic story about a man and his son trying to survive, going about their life one day a time in a brutal world, and that's already interesting to read about. But the symbolism of it all is on a whole different dimension—the entire book is an allegory of the human experience. And I don't think I need to tell you that the award-winning author Cormac McCarthy delivers this with an outstanding writing style. Simply brilliant!"

6288,2652286435,really liked it,"Me ha costado muchísimo leerlo (casi un mes), y no por la longitud de la historia... sino por lo angustioso que es. Es una historia pausada, no de esas en las que pasan cosas constantemente, y aún así no puedes despegar los ojos de sus páginas. Las descripciones que hace el autor sobre el ambiente te meten tan de lleno en él que puedes hasta oler lo que está contando. Es claustrofóbica. No apta para estómagos sensibles, pero sí apta para cualquiera que busque leer sobre una verdadera historia de amor, la de un padre y un hijo. Intensa."
6288,8560901,it was amazing,"Through a twisted landscape of blackened trees and ash a man and his young son make their way along the road, pushing a shopping trolley of their few supplies. They are trying to make their way south through the United States, to the coast where perhaps, the man hopes, it will be warm. They are starving and frightened and filthy, just like everyone else - but unlike almost everyone else, they have not resorted to cannibalism in order to survive. His only reason for living is his defenceless son.While there is no explanation, only a few vague hints, as to how the earth ended up like this, it seems clear that it's an ecological disaster. It is the worst outcome, because the earth itself is ruined. It may recover, but not until a long, long time after the last remaining survivors are gone. When the last scavenged tin has been cracked open, the last bit of gasoline or diesel used up, the last clothes rotted away, there will be nothing to replace them with. And with ash coating the ground even ten years later (I estimate the boy to be about that age, and he was born after the apocalypse), nothing can be grown.There are stories that you read because they're great stories - the plot and the characters are all. And there are stories that you read because of how they're written, and you visit them again and again because of the language. The Road is the latter. It's like reading poetry - poetry that makes sense. It has a sparse quality, and the near-absence of commas, apostrophes, em dashes, speech marks etc heighten this. It is one of those books where the way it was written, and how it has been formatted, echoes the story within. It reads like the present tense even though it's in past, giving it a timeless quality that is as frightening as the people kept locked in a basement, slowly being eaten by their captors.I love the line, spoken by an old man they encounter on the road and, against the man's better judgement, feed, where he says: ""Where men cant live gods fare no better."" (p.172) I know what my interpretation of this is, but like the best of art there's always more than one.This post-apocalyptic world is literally hell on earth. McCarthy doesn't moralise or pass judgement, he simply tells this stark story and lets it speak for itself. I could read it again and again and get more from the language each time. The story itself is quiet, unassuming, with moments of tension and heartache. I would especially recommend this to anyone interested in writing or studying creative writing, because even if you don't like the story or the way it was written, you can still learn an awful lot from the masterful control McCarthy has over prose. He wields words like the steps in a dance, every nuance precise, every letter meant to be there."

Περίμενα, λοιπόν, το ίδιο το βιβλίο να με εντυπωσιάσει αναλόγως και αυτό ακριβώς έγινε. Αυτό που έκανε ιδιαίτερη εντύπωση και στην ταινία και στο βιβλίο είναι ο μινιμαλιστικός τρόπος που περιγράφει την κατάσταση που βιώνουν οι ήρωές μας. Ο συγγραφέας δεν μας δίνει καμία ιδέα για το τι ήταν αυτό που έφερε την καταστροφή - αν και είναι σαφές ότι περιγράφει έναν πυρηνικό χειμώνα -, δεν αναφέρει τίποτα για την κοινωνική κατάρρευση που ακολούθησε και δεν έχει τίποτα να πει για οποιαδήποτε προσπάθεια των επιζήσαντων για να επαναφέρουν οποιαδήποτε έννοια πολιτισμού. Το μόνο που κάνει είναι να περιγράφει την περιήγηση ενός πατέρα και του παιδιού του στα ερείπια και την αγωνιώδη προσπάθεια να επιβιώσουν βρίσκοντας οτιδήποτε δεν καταστράφηκε. Εκ πρώτης όψεως όλα αυτά δεν λένε και πολλά και η αλήθεια είναι ότι σε ολόκληρο το βιβλίο δεν γίνεται κάτι πραγματικά συγκλονιστικό. Αυτό, όμως, που υπάρχει σε αφθονία είναι η διείσδυση του συγγραφέα στην ψυχολογία των δύο ηρώων μέσα σε αυτή τη δύσκολη κατάσταση και ο ρεαλιστικός τρόπος που αποδίδει τις αντιδράσεις τους. Οι ήρωές μας κρυώνουν, πεινάνε, φοβούνται, λυγίζουν κάτω από το βάρος που πρέπει να σηκώσουν και ψάχνουν μέσα τους να βρούνε τη δύναμη για να συνεχίσουν να προσπαθούν να επιβιώσουν. Αυτός ο τρόπος είναι που δημιουργεί πάρα πολλές στιγμές συγκίνησης, με τους διαλόγους ανάμεσα στον πατέρα και το μικρό του γιο να είναι σε πολλές στιγμές συγκλονιστικοί, με έναν συγκρατημένο τρόπο. Οπότε στο τέλος αυτό που μένει είναι μία ρεαλιστική ιστορία προσπάθειας επιβίωσης κάτω από άκρως δύσκολες συνθήκες, που αποκαλύπτει, όμως, και τις πολύ δύσκολες αποφάσεις που οι άνθρωποι θα καλούνται να πάρουν σε ένα τέτοιο μετά-αποκαλυπτικό σκηνικό όπου η σκληρότητα φαίνεται να είναι ο μοναδικός δρόμος και ο μοναδικός νομός είναι αυτός που ισχυρού. Στο τέλος, όμως, το συμπέρασμα είναι ότι η ελπίδα θα συνεχίσει να υπάρχει ακόμα και εκεί που δεν φαίνεται τίποτα θετικό στον ορίζοντα."

6288,604260550,it was amazing,"I just finished reading “The Road” and still have a lump in my throat, and my head is swirling with images. I should probably give myself time to swallow this lump in my throat before writing anything, but I think I will just get it over with.Unlike many reviewers, I never found “The Road” to be depressing, dark yes, but not depressing - very touching in fact. Also, unlike many reviewers, I never found the grammatical liberties to be bothersome. An apocalyptic world, but really not so very different from the world we live in. Pushing our metaphorical carts along the road of life, ever fearful of the possibility of evil lurking around each bend. The boy - innocence, the future? - keeper of the flame, lighting the way ahead?As with many great works of literature, the meaning extracted is dependent on the perspective of the reader. There have been so many great reviews already written of this novel, I will keep it short and just say - read it!"
6288,4600321,really liked it,"I am not exaggerating when I say that this book gave me nightmares -- flesh-eating men wandering the woods, marauders following your every move, the daily struggle to find food and shelter. I woke up relieved that it was just a dream, but then remembered that McCarthy's ashen world could exist. The bleakness of ""The Road"" doesn't seem that far from the accounts of those who survived the nuclear bombs on Japan (""Hiroshima"" by John Hersey is particularly memorable).Despite its dark nature, the writing is inarguably beautiful. I caught myself reading and rereading paragraphs to admire their rhythm.I'll be honest, I struggled to finish ""The Road."" But I willed myself to the end, having peeked ahead to discover that there is a somewhat optimistic ending. Had that bit of humanity not been there in the last chapter, why go through the struggle at all? Which is precisely why the man and his son kept plodding forward, trying to find hope."

O ir abiejų personažų judėjimas keliu, tiek tikruoju, tiek ir simboliniu, diena po dienos atliekant tuos pačius mechaninius, primityvius veiksmus - žvalgykis, ieškok, slėpkis, miegok - yra taip šiurpiai realistiška, kad galima šią knygą pakrikštyti bene realistiškiausiu distopinio žanro kūriniu. Vienintelis nepatikęs dalykas buvo autoriaus stilius. Itin trumpi, kapoti sakiniai atrodė neestetiškai ir skaitėsi ne taip maloniai, kaip norėtųsi. Kita vertus, gal tokio žanro knygoje taip ir turėtų būti. Labai kitokia ir smarkiai tradicinių klišių ribas peržiangianti knyga, tad nekeista, jog gavo Pulitzerį.

I read this back in 2012 and enjoyed it-as much as it can be enjoyed, anyway.) This one was dark and depressing. The author has a strange writing style that took a little while to get used to. There are no commas and no quotation marks. There is very little dialogue going on.  Despite the darkness and the ash that covers everything, I found the story to be hopeful. I also found the writing to be lyrical at times. The words the author chose really brought home the vast emptiness that the characters were facing. I enjoyed this book, but I'm pretty sure that I will never re-read it."

6288,366267432,it was amazing," Some musings on The Road and the genre of (post-)apocalypse: 1) (Post-)apocalyptic genre seems to me a very primal genre, an adaptive one, which is intimately concerned with life and death and the struggle for existence. The genre is crucially dependent on evolved properties of the human nature and mind, such as the emotion of fear which derives from human mind. “Fear” is the engine of the genre and the main reason for why genre exists. Humanity’s obsession with apocalypse and post-apocalypse is rooted in ancient humans and these roots of modern (post-)apocalyptic are found in the earliest folklore, myths, and religions of all races and cultures. This is naturally to be expected of a form so closely linked with basic emotion of fear. The (post-)apocalyptic imagination is hard-wired into us, it has always existed and it will continue to exist since it is a natural genre, rather than just cultural, and it addresses the greatest fear of humanity: the end of life and fear of death, death of all humans. Man’s worst fears come alive in this genre.Of course both culture and nature are crucial in shaping human mind but theses shapes that mind takes are limited by nature and vary within narrow bonds, that is, culture has a little room to maneuver, and when it does, it is in relation with nature. Nature can be compared with computer hardware, whereas culture is compared with operating system or software which is installed on the hardware.2) Some causes of apocalypse are man-made such as nuclear holocaust. Humans, through millions of years of adaptation and natural selection, have got installed in their mind some modules to fear some specific factors that endangered their lives, but since, for example, the atomic bomb is very recent, therefore humans need to learn to fear this danger because it is not natural, but constructed, and every fear that needs to be learned is culturally constructed. In this respect, one can conclude that all the cultural constructed fears are rooted in natural intrinsic fears of humanity, especially the fear of death. The popular belief, which derives from historicist approach to the genre, is that (post-)apocalyptic stories are the embodiment of the fears and anxieties of that specific time and, therefore (post-)apocalypse is entirely a cultural construction and invention. This is partly true, but these cultural fears, as mentioned before, are based on the evolved natural fears.3) Human mind, with the help of prefrontal lobes, enables humans to forecast and plan for future. The mechanism of planning and forecasting is dependent on imagery and emotion and also based on past and present experiences. As mentioned before, the emotion of fear is the heart of the genre, and a (post-)apocalyptic author experiences an emotion of fear and anxiety triggered by the environment, such as seeing a violent war or the melting of Antarctica’s ice, which in turn triggers in his mind an image of dark future based on this fearful experience. Through his imagination he forecasts what would happen, what the consequences would be, if this fearful event were taken to its most extreme level. The author presents the scenes on the paper in the form of a story, which can be regarded as a warning to all humanity. Apocalyptic thinking is a way people and authors cope with horrible and uncontrollable circumstances on the individual, local, or universal level. Of course, the coping method and forecasted future differ with person to person and writer to writer depending on his genes, environment he or she lives in, and the culture she or he comes from.Studying McCarthy’s life discloses numerous important features of his novels and the reasons behind creating the post-apocalyptic world. In case of The Road, McCarthy had four experiences that resulted to his imagined apocalypse: 1. growing up in the south and seeing the gory violence of the society and the corrupt culture which made him to be pessimistic toward human nature; 2. his immersion in the science that aggravated his pessimism; 3. the September 11 attacks followed by the Iraq War which yet again made him believe that the world is an unstable place; 4. and being the sexagenarian father of a seven-year-old son in this violent society. These experiences triggered in him the fear of his moral son living in this violent and immoral society, which in turn triggered the image of dark future in McCarthy’s mind. 4) Those (post-)apocalyptic works that stand the test of time in many cultures push the button of universal fears, that is, the fears that are natural and all humans share those fears and anxieties, or the fears that all the cultures have in common. The Road is not concerned with its local culture and society’s anxieties and traumas but mainly concerned with the universal fear of survival in a horrendous world. This will make it a classic.5) Fear-inducing stories like (post-)apocalyptic stories use the element of fear to logically scare and disturb its audience by bringing a calamity upon humanity, using natural and cultural underpinnings, and with this they increase the chances of humanity’s survival. In these stories, humans rebalance themselves. These stories directly confront humans with their behavioral universals. The severe environmental disorientation these stories simulate characteristically shocks and sobers up their audiences to re-examine the way they live their lives, to acknowledge their human nature, to contemplate a future possibility, and to avoid present lethal mistakes that may lead to the disaster mentioned in the story. This is, in a nutshell, is the thematic structure of (post-)apocalyptic works like The Road, in which the author simulates a world where survival is a challenge, human values are lost, and today’s facilities are no more. This affects readers deeply in the sense that they rebalance themselves and re-examine the life they have now. On the whole, literary and nonliterary apocalyptic texts make a significant contribution to the continuity of human life.6) According to Erik Hage, since the boy is born after the apocalypse, and since the cultural and social beliefs and structure are obliterated, therefore the boy is a blank slate because there is not culture or society in this post-end world and also because the boy is not tainted by the pre-apocalyptic cultural and social beliefs, the ones that brought calamity upon humanity. I argue against the concept of tabula rasa which Erik Hage made use of to show the boy’s moral behavior. One of the most important factors in shaping the boy’s behavior is the role of stories his father tells him. Adopting Michelle Sugiyama’s theory about the function of the stories—stories are sources of vicarious experiences and low-cost sources of information, that they delight in order to instruct— one can concluded that the boy’s goodness derives from the pre-apocalyptic moral stories that his father tells him.According to evolutionary psychology, humans are intrinsically both moral and immoral, and some individuals are more moral or immoral than the others based on their genes and environment they live. As the story suggests, the boy is intrinsically a morally superior person. The father also provided him an environment in which helps the boy to remain moral. The father’s stories are filled with pre-apocalyptic values and good guys who help other people, which the son bases his behavior on those values and the deeds of the heroes. This is why the boy, till the middle of the novel, tries to help all the life he encounters: because he is both intrinsically and culturally a moral person.7) Studying the role of stories in shaping the boy’s behavior also reveals the change in his worldview. When father and son take their journey to the south, the boy gets more exposed to the brutish post-apocalyptic environment. Though their arduous trek, the boy realizes the dysfunctionality of the pre-apocalyptic stories, with their moral values, in this present world, because he sees that practicing these moral traits may endanger his survival. According to evolutionary psychologists, every kind of human behavior is dependent on mind, genes, and environment. Different environments with their different stimulants lead the mind to develop differently and change the way in which the mind causes behavior. Therefore, the main reason for the behavioral change of the boy is the change of environment and its circumstances. The boy’s behavior is changed in favor of survival depending on the various environmental triggers. Therefore, his idealistic and chivalric behavior is replaced by utilitarian version of morality. Although the boy’s moral behavior is changed, McCarthy accomplishes to show his readers that the boy is still a moral figure, the one who “carries the fire” in the face of evil.8) Parental investment is much highlighted in this novel and one can claim that the emotional focal point of the story is the father’s devotion to his son. The reason why McCarthy did not much meditate on the apocalypse itself is that he intended to focus on the survival psychology of his characters’ and especially the father. McCarthy wrote The Road mainly because of his son and a keen eye can notice that the character of the father is a version of McCarthy himself and the character of the boy is McCarthy’s own son. Therefore the novel is mainly focused on the parent-offspring bond and filled with many examples of sacrifice and parental investment. The shining example of parental investment is the mother's suicide. She committed suicide to improve her husband and especially her son’s chances of survival without her being the burden. In this case, the mother’s suicide is an adaptive behavior because she realizes that she has no chances of survival due to her psychological and physical exhaustion, therefore, by committing suicide she can assist the replicas of her genes (her son) and increase the survival of her son and husband by ceasing to use resources so that they could use instead. 9) Through the medium of The Road, McCarthy the father tackled two main issues that were giving him pain in his personal life: human morality and parenting. It is inferred that with all the wickedness in this world the father (McCarthy) fears the disability of protecting his son forever and one day the boy should stand on his feet all by himself. He the McCarthy believes that the society is getting worse every day and expresses a deep pessimism regarding humanity’s self-destructiveness because of this violent society in which any moral expediency seems justified. His son, though a morally superior person, cannot heal this evilness and, as it is shown in the novel, the boy is reduced to a small child walking on the road but McCarthy believes that one should remain good in the face of evil whatever the circumstances are."
6288,49268309,it was ok,"I knew Cormac McCarthy and I were going to have differences from the moment I opened The Road and discovered the dearth of quotation marks. Yes, I’m one of those readers, and this is going to be that type of review. Exits are located on both sides. For those of you who choose to remain on board, please fasten your seatbelts. In the event the review experiences a sudden loss in pressure, an oxygen mask will erupt from your computer in a disturbing fashion. If you have an infant, well, you only get the one mask, so I guess you have a tough choice to make.A copy of The Road was finally available during my most recent trip to the library. Prior to that, all of the library copies were on hold or checked out when I visited. I wasn’t in a hurry to read this book, however, so I was content to wait. Having finally procured a copy, my feelings were largely indifferent. I had heard it is unapologetically bleak and sparse. I had also heard The Road is some kind of seminal work of post-apocalyptic fiction that has been responsible for numerous mind-blowing literary orgasms. Which brings me to my first …Ways to Improve The Road: Read it aloud while having sex. I have not verified this myself, but it seems like this might improve many books. Plus it’s multi-tasking, and so many people say they don’t have enough time to read for pleasure these days.There is a tone to The Road. Some people call it poetic, and at a stretch one might even say it’s melodious, but whatever one might call it, the tone is definitely there, and as a result, this novel sounds different from most novels. McCarthy creates the tone through the way he has structured the entire narrative, from the frequent transitions in time and place to the short, clipped dialogue unfettered by those oppressive quotation marks. Everything about the style of The Road is calculated to cultivate a certain atmosphere, one that is both distancing and intimate. I understand why some people find this book hauntingly beautiful or strangely enchanting—but I do not share that opinion.There comes a point in every reader’s life when he or she comes up against a book that forces a choice: when does a book’s stylistic idiosyncrasies preclude any enjoyment of story or plot? This point is different for everyone. As of this writing, two of the five books on my “did not finish” shelf are there because, try as I might, the way the book had been written interfered with my ability to read and enjoy it. I was particularly harsh on 
Blindness
, which also eschews the use of quotation marks. (McCarthy, to his credit, loves his paragraphs.) For many people, this is not a problem. For some people, like me, a book that abandons quotation marks instantly becomes a quagmire of lawlessness in which anything is possible: human sacrifice, cats and dogs living together … mass hysteria. It’s bad Road.Ways to Improve The Road: Add quotation marks. Stating the obvious, I know, but I feel like I should include this one, because it really is a simple fix. Just throw them in there so I know what’s dialogue and what’s narration. We can do wonderful things with ebooks these days … create a special quotation-marked edition! You can charge more, because the book has “bonus content”!Realistically speaking, I acknowledge that the lack of quotation marks is a deliberate choice, and to change that would be to alter the statement McCarthy is making. Fine. I accept that, and we will indeed move on in a moment. I just needed to establish how much this small choice affected my reading of this book. I skimmed all but the first 30 pages, because they were pretty much the same. I might still have skimmed if there were quotation marks … but maybe not as much?I say the majority of the book was “pretty much the same” in the sense that there is very little variation in the types of events that transpire prior to the climax. This is partly because of the bleakness in tone, which is the result of a lonely, oppressive sense of sameness that pervades the story. No matter how far the man and his son travel, the situation is the same: few or no people, scarce resources, no civilisation. Their universe has shrunk so much. In this microcosm McCarthy creates the conflict: survival is ever-increasingly a struggle, and for what reason are they trying to survive? The contemplation of suicide is never far from the man’s mind, and not just because that is what happened to his wife. This is not the type of post-apocalyptic fiction where a large group of survivors bands together to rebuild their shattered lives: these two characters are, for all intents and purposes, castaways; they are marooned in their own homeland.Ways to Improve The Road: Listen to a version read by Werner Herzog. There’s just something about the way he reads, the combination of his accent and his intonation and his utterly dry approach to something like Where’s Waldo. I think it would both highlight and improve the tone of The Road.McCarthy never specifies the mechanism of this particular apocalypse. I am totally cool with that. However, I would have liked to know more about how the man became so distrustful of strangers. Why did he never find a small group of people he could call a family—neighbours, coworkers, etc.? I’m sure there is a sensible reason, but without something to call an anchor, the man’s insistent distrust of every other human being seems more pathologically antisocial than anything else. In general, the interaction between the man and the boy irks me because of the way the man does nothing but talk in vague generalities. He tells the boy that they are “good guys” who still “carry the fire” and need to avoid “bad guys”. Yet he never seems to improve upon this shaky moral framework. We seldom witness him instructing his son on survival tactics. They just blunder from one place to the next with only the destination of the coast in mind.I can’t say with certainty what I would do if I found myself alone with a son in the middle of the wilderness and no smartphone. The more I read about post-apocalyptic or zombie fiction or see games like Fallout 3, the more I realize I am not cut out for a life that does not involve several hours of reading and web-surfing followed by one or more Star Trek re-runs: if The Road or its ilk are what life will be like after someone hits the button, then I hope I don’t survive the opening salvo. I’d like to think I would be the guy who retains or re-invents knowledge vital to my group’s survival, but I think we all know I’d probably just be the redshirt. Still, on the off chance that I do survive the actual apocalypse, I will not be using The Road as my survival guide.Ways to Improve The Road: Add a subplot. Any subplot.The Road is about the relationship between father and son. Though they labour constantly under the the threat of external conflict and confrontation, most of the book’s conflict comes from an existential angst. The father knows (or suspects) early in the book that he is dying, but he tries to hide this from his son for as long as possible. So most of the book is a chronicle of the hardships these two face as they travel southwest toward the coast, where they hope to find a more hospitable winter habitation.Unfortunately, I didn’t find this chronicle very riveting: the hardships are episodic and not all that interesting; the ending is predictable but extremely well-written. I just wish there were more here. I’m not sure how else to put that. The book doesn’t feel shallow, but it does feel like it could be denser. It could use some more substance—for example, more flashbacks to the man, his wife, and their infant, more about their story before she left and the world became so dark. Yes … more context.I rather suspected that I wouldn’t fall head-over-heels in love with The Road, and I didn’t expect to hate it, so I guess this book met my lukewarm expectations. It’s not bad, but it fails to engage me on that fundamental emotional level necessary for a book that’s all about the visceral. The somewhat experimental stylistic choices McCarthy makes actually undermine my enjoyment of the book—and while that is a very personal judgement on my part, it’s something to bear in mind: what’s essential to one reader’s enjoyment is a hindrance to another’s. On Goodreads I am always reminded of the diversity of opinions on any book; I love that I can be exposed to so many different tastes and points of view here! This is particularly true of The Road, and whatever its flaws may be, it merits the type of discussion it’s been getting.Ways to Improve The Road: Read it with a friend or friends. Discuss (preferably over pie)!

6288,2547006602,it was amazing,"Non è che ho molto da dire, se non che è una delle letture più intense che ho avuto modo di fare nell'ultimo periodo. Si tratta di un viaggio, lungo una strada, o forse più. Un viaggio di un uomo e di un bambino, che sospingono un carrello del supermarket in quello che è un mondo ormai andato in rovina, annerito, incenerito, grigio, senza più umanità. O meglio, con poca, pochissima umanità. Sia in termini numerici - veramente pochissimi sopravvissuti -, sia in termini di ""sentimento"".Dialoghi secchi, poche parole, tanta paura. Un freddo. Romanzo spoglio di dettagli appartenenti ad un mondo ormai vecchio, andato, perduto. Ma pieno di un sentire antico come il mondo. Il senso di solitudine, la paura di morire, la voglia di morire, il freddo dell'anima. E' il racconto dell'attaccamento al senso di umanità, un appendersi disperato a valori, concetti, modi appartenenti all'uomo e a nessun altro. Il cielo stellato sopra di me, la legge morale dentro di me. E' la storia di un saper lasciar andar via, sapersi lasciare, sapere quando è giusto farlo. Per salvare, per salvarsi.Grigio, spoglio, freddo, asciutto, umano. Splendido."
6288,62591404,really liked it,"Cormac McCarthy is some sort of literary cupid. I love The Road despite myself, and all because of what the book made me feel; or perhaps I have affection because the book made me feel anything at all, which so much contemporary literature fails to do. A father-son tale. A travel narrative. A meditation on the human condition when human instincts are stripped to their barest. I dig it.But at face value, my reasons for loving this book seem to be outnumbered by what I would qualify as some considerable flaws. To start, this book convinced me that Cormac McCarthy, in the tradition of many respected American (straight) male authors, knows jack squat about women, or at the very least that this great author’s powers of exposition suffer greatly in the face of a female subject. The slim sections of this book that detail the mother's role in the narrative felt, to me, to be out of place, partially because the juxtaposition of the mother’s long-winded explanations of herself against the terseness of the dialogue shared by the boy and man throughout the rest of the novel made her seem perhaps a bit crazy or extremely out of touch. This resulted in small sections of narrative that felt to me to be poorly written; as if McCarthy sticks so closely to terse, jutting, simple dialogue because larger expositions are a deep weakness. She enters at moments of desperation, sure, but this justification seems unsatisfactory to me; McCarthy would never let a character get away so easily. He fails here in my eyes because I am holding him to his own standard.I also remained unconvinced, by the book’s end, of the son’s role as some sort of post-modern, post-apocalyptic messiah. Yes: the boy remains the most hopeful, compassionate and therefore morally and emotionally compelling part of this book. But he is all the more compelling for me when I think of him as just that: a boy, with potential for some higher meaning that needn’t be expressed explicitly. I resisted the moments when McCarthy tended to reach for allegory by allowing the boy and the man to recognize the boy’s potential meaning, perhaps because articulating it or giving it a name in a work so concerned with sentiments that escape language proved to be unsatisfying.And yet… This book reminded me that I had a pulse, and that is the consummate qualification for greatness, as far as I am concerned. Beyond that, it became the first thing I’d think about each day and the last thing I’d consider each night while reading it. The mood of the prose, the lack of attention to what caused this apocalypse, the glimpses of horror and overall sweeping gestures of tenderness and sadness... all brilliant.Afterward, I found it impossible to pick up anything else because I remained so immersed in its world and in its language. I don’t really know what else to say about it. It moved me. Very deeply."
6288,2209063524,it was amazing,"Antes de entrar na discussão das diferentes experiências (livro e filme), quero deixar breves notas sobre o livro de McCarthy, “A Estrada” (2006). A história é bastante simples e direta, trabalhando o tema do pós-apocalipse que tem inundado o imaginário com múltiplas obras: filme — “Mad Max” (1979), “Stalker” (1979), ""Children of Men"" (2006), “The Book of Eli” (2010); videojogos — “Fallout 3” (2008), “Metro: Last Light” (2013), “The Last of Us” (2013); banda desenha — “The Walking Dead” (2003). O trabalho de McCarthy segue uma abordagem menos comum, ou seja, menos fantasiosa optando por um certo naturalismo, muito por McCarthy não ser um autor de género, acabando por realizar esta incursão à semelhança de outros escritores num tom mais dramático, tal como por exemplo Saramago fez em “Ensaio sobre a Cegueira” (1998).McCarthy situa a ação num momento posterior a uma qualquer catástrofe que destruiu todas as formas de vida no planeta, tendo apenas sobrevivido uma pequena parte da espécie humana. Somos colocados no encalço de um pai e filho que viajam para sul, atravessando áreas completamente inóspitas, e encontrando alguns, poucos desses sobreviventes, quase sempre hostis. O tom é marcadamente pesado e violento, a esperança não tem significado, e por isso a ideia central da obra acaba por se centrar numa busca para a fundamentação da sobrevivência. Não raras vezes, damos por nós a questionar, tal como acontece aos personagens: ""para quê tudo isto, porquê continuar com todo este esforço?"" McCarthy não dá respostas, nem podia dar, essas só podem ser dadas por cada um, individualmente.[O restante texto diz respeito a uma discussão entre os efeitos do texto e do audiovisual, e por isso provavelmente menos interessante para muitos.

She has at least a year... probably closer to two years food supply which includes 1,000 pounds of wheat. Seriously, I'm not kidding. She constantly reminds me to store enough food because in the event of some cataclysmic disaster grocery stores would be over run and our food supply would be decimated in less than three days. How's that for a feel good story?So I just finished reading The Road... another well written Cormac McCarthy novel. I breezed through the book despite it's dark tone. My only criticism is that ""the boy"" character at times seems so mature and full or wisdom, yet also able to fall apart on a whim. The lack of consistency in ""the boy"" personality made his character a bit unbelievable to me. I'd rather the kid act like a scared, whiny kid all the time rather than his token moments of yoda-isms which didn't ring true to me. I thought ""the man"" character was great and look forward to seeing the movie with Viggo Mortensen in the role... seems like great casting.My take away from this book and why I mentioned my paranoid friend is this... the real fear in terms of an apocalyptic event is not how much food you have in your pantry or garage, but how would you protect that food and how could you possibly transport 1,000 pounds of wheat to warmer climates? You can't.The Road is a dark, but realistic ""what if"" kind of book that forces us to take a hard look at humanity at it's worst--when survival instincts kick in and it's every man for himself and God for us all--if you believe in a higher power, that is. McCarthy's real achievement is creating a dystopian world which still offers hope... however small. Hope is what keeps all of us going down the road in our own crazy world."
6288,928106654,it was amazing,"Uma das piores coisas que me podiam fazer era abandonarem-me no livro The Road de Cormac McCarthy. A vivência dá lugar à sobrevivência e leva os poucos humanos restantes num cenário pós-apocalíptico a dividirem-se em facções: o que é moralmente correcto num mundo esquecido e matar para não morrer.Infelizmente, os primeiros têm sempre as maiores dificuldades pela frente, e esta história obscura e tétrica foca-se na viagem de um pai e um filho que lutam por viajar do norte do país até ao sul da costa.Desde o início temos uma visão do mundo em que se encontra. Algo queimou por completo a superfície do único mundo que conhecemos: o céu é eternamente coberto por nuvens de fumo; cinza cai cai independentemente de estar sol, chuva ou a nevar; ao longo d'a estrada os personagens encontram malas, carros, pessoas, tudo derretido e queimado ao ponto de se tornar irreconhecível.Assim que acompanhamos a luta dura destes dois protagonistas, sabemos que num mundo tão negro raramente acontecem coisas boas. Temos em conta a dificuldade que vão encontrar e sabemos que desde o princípio o homem vai ter a sua moralidade questionada, tanto pelas opções que lhe são dadas ao longo do caminho como também pelo próprio filho que ainda está a tentar compreender o único mundo no qual nasceu.A trama é simples e linear, mas as provações levam o leitor a ler página após página, numa tentativa de saber qual será o próximo desafio, de tentar conjugar a vontade de os ver finalmente bem, mas também de os ver enfrentar novas dificuldades.Tenho a certeza que, para aqueles que gostam de histórias ao estilo The Walking Dead, este livro é perfeito."
6288,970891917,really liked it,"This story is about a man and his boy struggling for survival in a world destroyed by some sort of cataclysmic event. I’ve read a few reviews of this book and the movie version (which I have not seen) and knew what I was getting into but I have to admit that I wasn’t quite prepared for the absolute funk this book put me into while listening to it. It is about struggling to survive amongst the bleakest of odds. It’s dark and it’s so very sad. It's terrible and awful with such painful moments of loveliness. There is very little dialogue and the conversations between the man and his boy are always very brief but the author manages to convey the desperation facing the pair and the strong bond and love between them.I’ve heard the writing style is difficult when read in book form but this wasn’t an issue with the audiobook. The narrator, Tom Stechschulte, was awesome and amazing and his gritty voice perfectly suited to the material. If you enjoy audiobooks and are in the right head space for a story so grim I recommend finding a copy of this audio version. Just make sure you have something that makes you happy nearby after you’re finished because you’ll need it.My booklikes friend recommends  Cute Overload . It worked for me!"
6288,1211074735,it was amazing,"A father and his son struggling for survival in a cold, sun-devoid and pillaged post-apocalyptic world. McCarthy does a wonderful job depicting the heaviness of this god forsaken world and what would become of humanity and Earth in the (not-so-unlikely) possibility of an apocalypse; the discouragement, depression and fear/horror ruling in this world; the kindness and innocence of the child; the fatherly love that transcends through every gesture, the struggle (interior and exterior) of the parent to keep his son alive, as he is his only reason to live and the hope of a possible future for humanity.For those who say that the book is too gloomy and oppressive and repetitive, I have just one question: how would you expect a post-apocalyptic world without sun and almost entirely lacking survival means to be anything other than this? IMHO, these things are exactly the ones that make it so painful real!

L'uomo e il bambino che camminano verso sud, spingendo un carrello della spesa con tutti i loro averi nel mezzo del nulla, non solo materiale ma umano (tenuti in vita solo dall'affetto che portano l'uno per l'altro) non si dimenticano facilmente. E riempiono di domande sul nostro quotidiano, sui nostri rapporti. La prosa è scarna come il panorama che li circonda, bruciato da una non meglio definita catastrofe (ambientale, nucleare? non si sa). Anche il rapporto che lega padre e figlio è bruciante di un calore bianco che riesce a tenerli in vita nonostante la vita non ci sia più. In mezzo a questa desolazione, Mac Carthy riesce a vincere la tentazione di non dare speranze, e in chiusura lascia acceso una fiammella che forse potrà riaccendere l'umanità. Ps: il contesto ricorda l'Eternauta (una delle più grandi graphic novel mai disegnate)."

I hate being left with questions!There were also several strange grammar conventions, mainly the missing quotes around dialogue and repetition of certain words (I'm Okay!) that drove me crazy, but the descriptions of the landscape was where the author's prose really hit home.The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Sustained by a breath, trembling and brief. If only my heart were stone.This isn't a book for everyone, but if you want to see what life really would be like in a Post-Apocalyptic scenario, this is probably as close as you hopefully will get."

6288,4017392,it was amazing,"Cormac McCarthy's The Road is one of those books that you feel you really shouldn't miss out on. The reviews have been overwhelmingly glowing. I picked it up to read on the basis of these reviews and despite its recently being chosen as Oprah Winfrey's latest selection for her book club.""It may be the saddest, most haunting book he's ever written, or that you'll ever read,"" says the reviewer for The Village Voice, who also goes on to say, ""the tender precariousness of The Road's human relationships is what finally makes it such a beautiful, difficult, near perfect work.""The Guardian's reviewer comments that ""part of the achievement of The Road is its poetic description of landscapes from which the possibility of poetry would seem to have been stripped, along with their ability to support life."" The world of The Road is dark and bleak, uniformly dead. The people are dead, the wildlife is dead, the foliage is dead. These are not landscapes that would seem to lend themselves to poetry or to compelling description, but McCarthy manages to mine the landscapes for the poetry of their very existence.The Powell's Books reviewer, Tom Chiarella, writes, countering temptations to read The Road as a warning, a tract, or a metaphor,But you shouldn't read this book for the metaphoric possibilities of change in the life of mankind. You know all that crap already. Yeah, yeah, we're headed for doom. You should read this book because it is exactly what a book about our future ought to be: the knife wound of our inconvenient truths, laid bare in a world that will just plain scare the piss out of you on a windy night.In The New York Review of Books, Michael Chabon writes,The paradox in every part and sentence of the post-apocalyptic narrative—evoking even as it denies—is repeated as if fractally by The Road as a whole. . . . This paradox, like a brutal syllogism, leads McCarthy, almost one senses in spite of himself, to conclude The Road on a note of possible redemption that while moving and reassuring is prepared for neither by one's reading of his prior work nor, perhaps, by the novel itself. In order to destroy the world, it becomes necessary to save it.Possible redemption? I find much of Chabon's review insightful, but I do not see any redemption in this book. The final paragraph of the novel is the only break in the bleak and overwhelming trip the father and son have made:Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery. (286-7)This final section of The Road may gesture toward a better world, but it is a world that no longer exists. At the end of the novel, all fish are dead, all streams are polluted and dead or dying, and the boy does not even have memories of the world that is described in this final paragraph. These ""maps of the world in its becoming"" are long since gone, as is the world they mapped, and this world can ""not be made right again."" This seems to be something other than hope. Nostalgia, perhaps. Loss. Regret. A sense of the insignificance of humanity. But not hope.Chabon also writes, more convincingly, of The Road's treatment of the father-son relationship that is at the heart of the novel:The Road is not a record of fatherly fidelity; it is a testament to the abyss of a parent's greatest fears. The fear of leaving your child alone, of dying before your child has reached adulthood and learned to work the mechanisms and face the dangers of the world, or found a new partner to face them with. The fear of one day being obliged for your child's own good, for his peace and comfort, to do violence to him or even end his life. And, above all, the fear of knowing— as every parent fears—that you have left your children a world more damaged, more poisoned, more base and violent and cheerless and toxic, more doomed, than the one you inherited. It is in the audacity and single-mindedness with which The Road extends the metaphor of a father's guilt and heartbreak over abandoning his son to shift for himself in a ruined, friendless world that The Road finds its great power to move and horrify the reader.Despite the earlier injunctions (in Chiarella's review) against reading The Road as metaphor, this virtually demands it be seen as such. It is certainly about this generational anxiety, this burden of responsibility, but this burden of responsibility cannot stop at the boundaries of personal relationships. The precept of the Iroquois that ""in every deliberation we must consider the impact on the seventh generation... even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine"" calls upon the same sense of human responsibility that McCarthy's father feels for his son. We may not know exactly what happened to cause this apocalypse in The Road, but this vagueness allows us to envision the many ways in which our actions today could condemn future generations to such a diminished and hopeless life.In this light, perhaps most interesting is the commentary by the reviewer for The Modern Word. He writes, ""Ultimately, The Road suggests that no matter how bleak our existence, we must live life as if it has meaning. As if our progenitors are watching; as if there is a line separating the good guys from the bad guys."" And perhaps, as if our descendants are watching.This is precisely what the father and son in the book try to do, at some times with more energy and heart than at other times. They are driven by a desire, a need, to be ""good guys,"" to separate themselves from those who steal others' means of survival, those who hold people captive until they can eat them, those who kill and eat children. They live to hold themselves apart from the others they encounter on the road. The horrors of becoming one of those others is illustrated most dramatically in a scene in which they come across an abandoned campsite with ""a charred human infant headless and gutted and blackening on the spit"" (198).In this quest to be good guys, to do the right thing, to survive, however, there are choices to be made. At what point does a father sacrifice his own son to protect him from rape and cannibalism? Can he do such a thing? How long does he have to force himself to remain alive to protect his son? How long will he be capable of doing such a thing?To make this obvious as a decision to be made, McCarthy includes memories of the boy's mother, who killed herself before he had a chance to know her but after the event that ruined the world. ""We're survivors,"" the father told her, but she did not believe him. ""What in God's name are you talking about? We're not survivors. We're the walking dead in a horror film"" (55). He begs her not to kill herself, to stay with him and their son. Her reply, over the course of the conversation, is chilling in the way that it so thoroughly captures the hopelessness and despair of the situation:I didn't bring myself to this. I was brought. And now I'm done. . . . You cant protect us You say you would die for us but what good is that? I'd take him with me if it werent for you. You know I would. It's the right thing to do. . . . Sooner or later they will catch us and they will kill us. They will rape me. They'll rape him. They are going to rape us and kill us and eat us and you wont face it. You'd rather wait for it to happen. But I cant. I cant. . . . You talk about taking a stand but there is no stand to take. My heart was ripped out of me the night he was born so dont ask for sorrow now. There is none. . . . As for me my only hope is for eternal nothingness and I hope it with all my heart. (56-7)The father cannot make this choice, though. He knows the need to live, to protect his son from the horrors of this new world, to protect his life. And the son, though he cannot protect his father from the horrors, knows that he bears responsibility as well. As the book progresses and the father weakens, the son begins to watch him, guarding him, holding him accountable for eating his share and for doing the right thing. This is most revealed after an encounter with a thief. The father and son recover their stolen things, but the father cannot resist taking the thief's few meager belongings in retaliation, even as the boy begs him to leave him something, recognizing that they have just condemned the man to death just as surely as if they'd killed him themselves.Just help him, Papa. Just help him. The man looked back up the road. He was just hungry, Papa. He's going to die. He's going to die anyway. He's so scared, Papa. The man squatted and looked at him. I'm scared, he said. Do you understand? I'm scared. The boy didn't answer. He just sat there with his head bowed, sobbing. You're not the one who has to worry about everything. The boy said something but he couldnt understand him. What? he said. He looked up, his wet and grimy face. Yes I am, he said. I am the one. (259)He is the one who ends up worrying about and trying to care for his father. And he is the one who survives, who has to worry about living with the other survivors, who has to continue to worry about the moral obligations of survival in this changed world.Not much happens in the novel and when it does happen it is described in a spare, understated manner. No dramatics or histrionics here. The world may have ended, but there's no point in screaming about it. This lean style, coupled with the short segmented writing (the novel is constructed from over 200 short sections, not quite chapters, some of which could be fit anywhere in the novel), the rarity of dialogue or human contact, and the repetitive nature of the story, simultaneously gives the narrative a sense of the ordinariness of affairs in this strange new world and provides a slowly but steadily ratcheted-up sense of drama. Encounters with the bizarre and horrific are described matter-of-factly, but the sheer magnitude of these things, the way the world continues to reveal death at every turn, lends them a weight that the straightforward description and delivery would not necessarily if these encounters were discrete events. This is truly a novel in which the cumulative effect is greater than the sum of its parts.The novel is moving because it frightens with its realism and deadens with its matter-of-factness. This is a world that we want to avoid, but, despite the surface differences (post-apocalyptic barrens and roving bands of cannibals), it is a world, McCarthy seems to say, that is not so far removed from our own."
6288,2319993897,,"Nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave.It is in this state of utter bewilderment, shock and tears, that I present to you my first Goodreads review after a two month absence, at the least. So, I guess, this is a hello! All I can say about this book, is that it is a punch in the gut, a tear in the heart and a horror to the mind. It's repulsive, startling, full of emotion.After a lot of thinking, I don't think I can possibly rate this book, and saying this, I'm becoming more and more sceptical of the entire 'rating-books-with-a -single-star' system. Can we really sum up a book using little, plain stars - when it is anything but plain? Of course, I'm being a bit of a hypocrite here, criticizing the whole rating system, because I for one, always try to rate books, but... I just never realized how meaningless they are; how little they tell us about the book itself, apart from a general, subjective opinion. This book was one of the most terrifying objects I have ever seen - the story it holds is brutal, exhilaratingly daunting and bleak. I had to thoroughly remind myself that what I had just read was fictional, wasn't real, was not happening in this day and age. Truly, it shook me to the core. My opinion on: ✎ - The plot: When you think of the word apocalypse, the first few words that come to mind, most likely are: chaos, zombies, adventure. Yet, this book completely tossed these connotations out the window, replacing them with a plotline, focusing more on routine, whilst still letting survival play the major role in this post-apocalyptic wasteland. Many people will say that this book is monotonous - the characters walk down the road, light a fire, sleep underneath thin blankets, shiver from the cold cold - and then all of that played on repeat, like a frozen mixtape. And, yes, this is true, yet this constant repetion of actions, whilst sometimes tough to read through over and over again, is key in the portrayal of the loving bond between father and son, and their way of everyday life, and survival.It's like our routine - walking up, eating breakfast, going to school/work, etc., but in extreme mode. The strangeness of this book settles upon the fact that the reader doesn't really know what happened to cause this tragedy, that the two characters managed to live through. Although there are many possible reasons and hints throughout the novel, the very thought that something like that could, potentially, happen one day, is petrifying. Ultimately, it's all up to us - humans and the way we treat one another. ✎ - The characters: By characters, I mean the two main characters. The incredible bond between father and son was what really stood out in this book to me, personally. Their dependence on one another - the father on his son's heart; the boy on his father's rational, logical thinking - was phenomenally written. They were each other's anchors. I felt so much affection for both of them - truthfully, they could easily be real people. When in trouble, my pulse raised alongside them, when they were finally rewarded, I remember feeling all warm inside too. As a fifteen year old, I felt so torn between the two character's way of living. I felt that at times I related more to the young boy's loving opinions on the world and his empathetic, naive affection for everybody, and, at times, agreed more with the father. That's the universal beauty of this book - one is able to see it through different perspectives, and through the perspective of time. ✎ - The atmosphere: This, hands down, has got to be the most terrifying book I have ever read.And, as someone who rarely ever reaches for books, regarded as 'scary' - I think it's safe to say that even the most avid horror lovers out there, will flinch at least once during this story. The irony is that there are no supernatural creatures. Forget zombies, curses, figures of death. In this book, humans are the monsters. And, that's probably the most terrifying aspect of it. Cormac McCarthy delivers a truly disgusting and raw portrayal of the human nature and the extent people will go to, in order to survive. I think it's only decent to warm, that some, if not many, scenes in this book are disturbing to the mind . And, I honestly don't recommend reading this book before bed. After finishing it, I was left in complete shock and disbelief, having to remind myself that what I had just read was a figment of somebody's imagination, that it was a nothing but a work of fiction. But, then again, that's the power of good fiction - it makes you feel something. If a story leaves you shattered mentally after the last page, it's only fair to say that the author did a damn good job. An interesting (probably not so interesting, though) fact is that, after attending a literature class, I had the opportunity to take part in a interesting discussion about the symbolism and allegory found in this book, and was left dumbfounded to find that there were two possible endings to the story, depending on perspective. I'd be more than willing to chat with someone on that matter, so if you've read the book and want to chat, feel free to message me. To wrap this review up, The Road was a long chain of different emotions, reactions and opinions. And, like I said earlier on, I just cannot, in any shape or form, rate it fairly. All I know is that there is nothing more scarier than the human race, and what the human mind is capable of creating. Once again, I'd like to remind that whilst this book is immensely unnerving in its gore and imagery, it is also eye-opening, and for that reason, worth a read."
6288,208720007,it was amazing,"#1: I loved this book. #2: If you didn't like this book that's ok too. #3: I'm not one of those self-centered ridiculous reviewers that think if you hated a book I love (or visa versa) that makes you some kind of moron. No, actually that just means we don't like the same types of books. Anyway, that aside, here are my takeaways from Cormac McCarthy's The Road:This book contained some of my favorite literary tools. One thing I specifically look for in my reading material is that the characters are treated as being real entities. Meaning, when I start reading a book, I love it when it just drops you into the middle of what's going without any explanation of how they got there or what exactly is going on. It's like this person(s) has their own life and situations they are dealing with but we are fortunate enough to get to pull back the veil for only a short amount of time to see just a section of their life. No crazy back story and ridiculous Epilogue that tries to tie everything up together in a nice little bow. Because of this, there are many things in this book that I love and appreciate that seems to grate on other readers of this book:*No quotation marks-this doesn't bother me because it's pretty easy to tell the difference between a little boy talking and a man. If I need to stop a conversation because I can't tell whose talking, a kid or a full grown adult, that's pretty sad.*No chapters-Guess what people?!! Life isn't magically separated into nice well put together chapters. It's one long continuous moment and then it's done. Period. We may speak about ""new chapters in our lives"" but last time I checked life isn't segregated into a clear chapter ending and clear chapter beginning. So don't expect to be able to ""just read one more chapter"" and then break. There are sections that are separated by asterisks to indicate a significant amount of time lapse and I would suggest breaking at those areas if needed. *I appreciate the fact that the MC's are never given names. It's only supposed to be the two of them wondering through a post-apocalyptic wasteland so what's the point of names? This also makes the characters more relateable in my opinion because they are so nondescript and ""everyman"".*I've seen many reviewers get upset because the events of the apocalypse are not explained. That's because this book isn't about the apocalypse. Go read an over the top zombie novel if that's the only thing you're looking for. This is basically a kind of [insert end of world scenario here] so that, again, it can be more relateable. It could be about any kind of apocalypse out there. Also, its mentioned in the book that its been many years since it happened. Its no longer the primary characteristic of the story. The boy seems like he could be about 8-10 years old and he was just born when it happened. If its been that long why would expect the author to go back and rehash all that happened? If that were the plan, he wouldn't have started out the story that long AFTER the event. It's been so long the boy doesn't even know what Coca Cola is so really the event that happened to put them in that scenario is no longer even remotely relevant as the ash filled gray world is literally all the boy even knows.*I loved that nothing of real tremendous importance happened throughout the story because again, that's life. Life isn't big explosions and page after page of melodrama. I feel like this book portrayed about as true of a dystopian future as you could get. Not because of any thrilling event but because of the total lack of them. Days and days and days on the road without any human contact and without any visual stimuli then a random happenstance with some crazies which is just as quickly over. I would make an assumption that if it's that long into a post-apocalyptic world that would be pretty accurate.*I've seen comments on other reviews about how this was too depressing and the characters didn't try hard enough to find things to be happy about. Really? You've been living 10 years (guessing) in a wasteland without hardly anything to eat, no clean water, no clean air, and killer bandits, but yeah you're totally right, it should be a no brainer that these characters should be happy go lucky and talking each others ears off all the time. I'm sure that's how you would be.In conclusion:If you need a book that has over-exaggerated characters, wildly descriptive imagery, and any and all reasons to suspend belief...then this is not the book for you. There are no dragons, fiery explosions, western style standoffs, pointless monologueing, witches, aliens, zombies, love triangles or high school valley-girl dialogue. This is not Harry Potter, World War Z, Ender's Game, Twilight or any other highly commercialized fiction novel. This is a simple story about a man and a boy doing their best to survive in a world that has long forgotten about the insignificance and annoyance of the human race. Having nothing else but the other to push them to keep going.I will definitely be reading more McCarthy books."
6288,620295859,it was amazing,"""A Estrada"" filme realizado por John Hillcoat com Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron e Kodi Smit-McPhee. “A Estrada” é o décimo romance do escritor norte-americano Cormac McCarthy (n. 1933) e foi uma autêntica surpresa pela temática abordada, num contexto de viagem ao futuro, onde a tragédia e a devastação imperam de uma forma dramática. “Quando acordava nos bosques, na escuridão e no frio da noite, estendia a mão para tocar na criança que dormia a seu lado. Noites de trevas mais densas do que as próprias trevas e cada dia mais cinzento do que o anterior.” Assim se inicia o romance de Cormac McCarthy que tem como protagonistas um pai e um filho que deambulam num cenário pós-apocaliptíco, por bosques repletos de árvores queimadas, calcinadas, numa paisagem árida e estéril, com chuva permanente e um frio desolador, incêndios florestais e neve cinzenta, poeiras e cinzas negras, numa destruição sem limites, com cadáveres humanos ressequidos e mumificados de pele negra.É nesta paisagem de “inverno nuclear” que pai e filho percorrem, com o objectivo final de chegar à costa, numa luta permanente pela sobrevivência física e emocional, nomeadamente, pela fuga aos “homens maus”, numa relação de amor e protecção sem limites e sem esperança, na procura de um “mundo” que já não existe, nem provavelmente voltará a existir. “A Estrada” pode ser considerado como um romance de ficção científica ou romance de “horror”, com uma narrativa fragmentada, sóbria e opressiva, em que a moralidade assume particular relevância, nomeadamente, no relacionamento afectivo entre pai e filho, e em que apesar da amplitude e dimensão das paisagens e dos cenários envolventes, sentimos permanentemente uma claustrofobia avassaladora.A adaptação cinematográfica era inevitável e agora só me resta ver o filme realizado por John Hillcoat protagonizado por Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron e Kodi Smit-McPhee.

6288,722985695,did not like it,"Let me start by saying...I went into this book not really knowing what I was in for. I picked it because it fit in with a reading challenge I was doing.The first thing to bother me was the really off-putting POV that the whole story was written in. I felt like a perverse stalker.And let me tell you, things did not get better. There was pretty much no plot, no real characterisation, and nothing fundamentally exciting actually happened. Even when it got that that climax I felt nothing! Nothing for anyone.Considering I normally have emotional reactions to books, this just went towards proving to me that this book did absolutely nothing for me.My verdict: But that's not enough...P.S If you want a rather more articulate, yet no less scathing review, check out Michael J.

6288,1893492280,really liked it,"So, I am late to the party as usual with one of the most popular post-apocalyptic novels published in the 21st Century (I guess along with World War Z, which I have also not read), and multi award winning as well!Helped by the fact I came down sick over the long weekend, this was a pretty quick read. I am trying to work around spoilers here - but have I ever read a book in which so little actually happens between the starting situation and the situation a few pages from the end? I can't recall one...But the book is quite entrancing with its bleakness. There is a grey, colourless beauty in its futility, it's grimness, it's lack of hope. The reduction of all people to a baseness of survivalist greed, without a level of trust, or expectation of anything other than competing to survive. Sad and stark, and with only vague clues as to the cause of the apocalypse, there is little explained, but a level of confusion - of dreams, or memories, of the random, perhaps, causing enough doubt for the reader to wonder if clues were missed (maybe I did?).Personally I thought the writing lived up to the hype, I enjoyed the read, but I will surely be looking for something more upbeat to read next!4 stars."

6288,9193598,it was amazing,"(My full review of this book is much longer than the excerpt seen below; find it in its entirety at the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com].)So when I first heard that it was Cormac McCarthy who authored the Pulitzer-winning ultra-bleak post-apocalyptic thriller The Road, like a lot of people my first thought was, ""Wait a minute, isn't he that dude who writes them frilly Westerns that are so loved by those Oprah zombies and that get made into precious award-winning films starring that dreamy Matt Damon?"" And indeed, McCarthy's most well-known novel, All the Pretty Horses, is guilty of all the things just mentioned, which I suppose is what has made me lump McCarthy's name in my head all these years with such schlockmeisters as Larry McMurtry and Nicholas Sparks. But the more I've heard about The Road this year, and the more that people I admire can't seemingly shut up about it, and the more I investigate McCarthy's life and career because of it, the more I'm realizing that the picture I've had of him and his work in my head all these years is quite wrong; that McCarthy is actually a lot more known for extremely bloody and violent meditations on the limits of human depravity, using such genres as Westerns not in an attempt to sell more potboilers to desperate loners at supermarkets, but rather as a convenient metaphor for the utter lawlessness and anarchy that humankind is at its basest and least civilized.And this is in fact the very first thing to understand about 2006's The Road if you don't already, something that may possibly stop you from actually reading it -- that it is without a doubt the most bleak, unrelentlessly hopeless look at humanity perhaps ever caught in a mainstream novel (certainly an award-winning, Oprah-loving novel), a book that on almost every page displays not even the tiniest hint of a reason why the human race would ever be worth saving. And there's a very good reason for this, too, because McCarthy is trying to examine a very important and basic question about humanity here, one that almost can't be explored without an ultra-bleak post-apocalyptic setting; of just why it is that some humans continue to have hope in the face of such overwhelming odds, and why it is that others give up in the same situations at the specific moments they do.It's a fascinating thing to explore, of course, especially in this age of Bushism and government-sanctioned torture..."
6288,31420448,really liked it,"There is little plot in The Road, and that is good; the story is tedious, repetitious and slow, and that too is good; the story is about two characters and the way they love each other, and this is very good; all the information you need about McCarthy's future world is there if you want to do the work, and doing the work is also good; when it comes down to it The Road is very good no matter the complaints you may read or hear to the contrary.That is all I can say for now. I need to let The Road settle in my consciousness to see where it will land in my pantheon of books.What I can say is that it moved me deeply, the prose was a wonder, and I think it is one of the best father/son relationships I have ever encountered.If my strong feelings deepen this book will rise in my estimation; if my feelings weaken it may wound this book terminally for me. Only time will tell.But one final comment I must make is that anyone who compares The Road to Blindness -- or worse states that the latter is greater than the former -- is one whose opinions are necessarily suspect. The former is genuine, realistic, stark, unwavering; the latter is an unimaginative debacle posing as deep allegory. Read the former and steer clear of the latter."

I found this book so dark, eerie and the relationship between the man and the son was so realistic in the circumstance. You can feel that love that man has for his son, the desire to protect him at all cost. The absolute trust the son has towards his father like all children have to their parents. You can feel the bleakness of this world, the pure darkness and there was moments where I held my breath because I was so emotional attached to the man and son.

I thought I was going to listen to Kerouac's ""On the Road"" but instead I started Cormac's dark odyssey. I of course knew I'd made a mistake right away. But it was too late: the narrative had me. I listened to it when I was lying near my young son's bed waiting for him to fall asleep. It terrified me the way few books can. I was scared for the man and his son. I gasped audibly when they were in danger. I cried pitifully at the end.A few years later I returned to this book when I was going through a divorce. Unable to see my son as often as I wanted, I read through the desperate trek of a father clinging to his boy in a nuclear wasteland. I didn't gasp on this second read. But I did cry again.McCarthy's prose is bleak and sad. Yet this is a book about a parent's love: what we try to do for our children and the horrible moment in which we know we can't do enough and they have to go on without us.I don't recommend this book. I don't even like to talk about it. But I do ask readers who are parents if they've read it and if they have I feel a bond with them.Carac"
6288,131280782,really liked it,"Apocalyptic western with slow prose dry as ashes and succulent as nature's breath. Every day the man and the boy face death and the constant collapsing of hope, knowing no future nor reason for why they still exist. All the world is grey in the unknown, save for chance meetings with cannibals and flashes of the past that offer the barest glimpse of how things came to be. There is another story behind the walking existence offered here, but that is left up to the reader to parse together from descriptions of burned landscape and dried corpses, extinct species and no food left save for the walkers. It is a story as smooth as a flow of movement with no record of time, only a slow soft degradation into the wasteland. The ending brings a small glimpse of something akin to hope, a contentment found with humans who have found in each other something more than the monsters they are surrounded by."
6288,510039126,it was amazing,"I read McCarthy in 1993 because my best undergrad friend and intellectual rival, Scott Parker, was a fan. I read Child of God and loved it- a simple, deeply chilling narrative of a mad man. In 2000, I read Cities of the Plain, meh.This novel, The Road, was more like Child of God, in that it depicts the basest, scariest elements of human nature without flinching. It is also stark and universal by leaving main characters and places nameless, timeless. It tells of the toil to survive and protect one's progeny even in the face of the end of the world. And though the outlook is entirely bleak, one holds onto hope throughout the story and in the end finds some reward. "

Basti pensare che i dialoghi sono solo dei botta e risposta, senza precisazioni come ""lui disse"" - ""egli rispose"", e la punteggiatura tipica dei dialoghi è totalmente assente. La storia è molto semplice. Un padre e un figlio, senza nome, senza niente tranne un carrello arrugginito con dentro poco cibo e pochi averi percorrono una strada verso sud. Vanno verso il mare. Non vengono mai specificati nomi di luoghi ma probabilmente le vicende si svolgono in America e i due protagonisti stanno andando verso il Golfo del Messico. Lo scenario è apocalittico, il mondo è stato distrutto da una catastrofe non meglio specificata (forse un disastro nucleare o un meteorite). Ogni forma di vita, animale o vegetale, è stata spazzata via, i pochi sopravvissuti non hanno più nulla di umano e attraversano quest'immensa terra desolata in cerca di cibo come morti che camminano. E spesso il ""cibo"" è un altro essere umano... Si succedono così una serie di episodi e incontri: la visita alla casa d'infanzia dell'uomo; l'esplorazione di un supermarket abbandonato, il figlio che beve per la prima volta una lattina di coca cola; gli esseri umani tenuti prigionieri come scorte di cibo; il neonato allo spiedo; il vecchio sperduto e sotto shock; il ladro; il treno abbandonato, il bunker sotterraneo pieno di cibo; la nave arenata... La madre del bambino compare in un paio di flashback ma non viene detto chiaramente se si è uccisa o se è solo fuggita. Nel finale infatti, dopo la morte del padre, il bambino viene raggiunto da un uomo che gli dice che per sopravvivere dovrà unirsi a lui e al suo gruppo di ""buoni"". Lì il bambino ritrova ""la donna"" e da come viene descritto l'incontro sembra proprio che sia la madre. Ma la scrittura di McCarthy dice e non dice, alcune cose vengono volutamente lasciate all'immaginazione. Proprio come il finale che rimane aperto per lasciare un barlume di speranza. "
6288,50264746,really liked it,"When I was about fifteen, I watched American History X. And it was, I guess, really good. It was shocking, and it was brutal, and I think it made me cry. It probably crushed some of my illusions at just the right time. But was it that great? Quite apart from the fact that the ending was a cop-out, I'm not convinced. I have this niggling worm of a feeling somewhere deep inside my inner ear that it's somehow... easier to write (or make films about) deep heavy shit like that. You know, all happy families are the same, all unhappy families are different in their own way kind of thing. For all that I love extreme racial tension and post-apocalyptic journeys, I'm much more impressed by a book about a woman going to buy some flowers. I'd rather read about some ordinary girl trying to decide who to marry than about death and destruction. Provided it's beautifully written and perfectly realised, of course (which it has been. Extra points if you can guess which books I'm referring to). This is Tolstoy to Chekhov stuff, and I choose Chekhov.But really, what the fuck am I talking about? This book was very nearly great. The pacing was brilliant, I liked the weird new vocabulary and the lack of punctuation, the dialogue between the man and the boy was brilliant. And I've always thought that despite almost everything, life was still worth living because of the art and the music and the sheer inexplicable worthiness of learning stuff. But here you have a book where all of those things are gone. Every single book was swollen with damp! I could deal with everything else, but a post-apocalyptic world without books, I couldn't deal with. But then at the end it turned out there was something to live for, and I won't spoil it, it's clichéd enough to guess, but well done enough that it doesn't matter. Tears are cheap, but I didn't shed any. So I liked it a lot, and I'm going to go see the movie when it comes out ($6 tickets at Nova on a Monday, bargain), and what's more I'm going to hope the movie doesn't slaughter the book, and I'm going to avoid Justin Clemens' discussion of same, because he's an idiot. I also think there may well be something in what Bram said in his review:""I bet more than a few writers and would-be writers read this and thought, “Damn, if only I had written this first,” rather than the actually true statement of “Damn, I wish I could write something like this.” ""But I didn't love this book. I still prefer Chekhov."
6288,86386408,it was amazing,"A man and his son, journey south through post-apocalypic America (we assume). Travelling to escape the winter, which equiped as they are with rotten blankets and worn shoes will never survive. Reading McCarthy will put you into this world, you'll taste ash as you read, glance over your shoulder, and check whether your revolver is close at hand. By far the key strength of this novel is the setting, its not just basic setting description, McCarthy uses some unusual devices to communicate just how haunted the world has become. There are no names, not for the father or the son, or any of the places they visit. The author uses no quotation marks, a tactic that makes us feel the stifling scilence of the road. On a brief tangent, there is a totally bizarre paragraph on page 87 which I can't quite figure. The narration slips into first person, and doesn't contain any spoilers so I'll plonk it right here. ""The dog that he remembers followed us for two days. I tried to coax it to come but it would not. I made a noose of wire to catch it. There were three cartridges in the pistol. None to spare. She walked away down the road. The boy looked after her and then looked a me and then he looked at the dog and he began to cry and beg for the dog's life and I promised I would not hurt the dog. A trellis of a dog with the hide stretched over it. The next day it was gone. That is the dog he remembers. He doesn't remember any little boys."" I initially thought is was narration from some bad guys stalking our protaganists, but that doesn't pan out, and this is the only slip into first person narrative in the novel. (any insights into this section would be more than welcome!!) The Road is an excellent read for something a bit less fluffy, don't expect some action flick in novel form, expect a heart-breaking tale of strength and humanity."
6288,33129892,it was amazing,"A lot of books get hyped and you go to read them and they are a real let-down. Most recently for me it was The Story of Edgar Sawtelle. And I probably had a bit of an attitude before even picking up The Road -- Pulitzer Prize winner, Oprah Book Club selection, now a ""major motion picture""...yeah, yeah, yeah. All this praise and worship was a little bit nauseating. So for the first book of 2009 I decided to see if The Road could bear up under the weight of such gargantuan, exhaustive praise. In short, absolutely, unequivocally yes. I just couldn't help but be awed by McCarthy's spare prose. The Road is a real exercise in discipline. There are no extra words...none. The writing is fluid like poetry. The imagery moves from stark to hauntingly beautiful. Of all the books I've ever read on the end-of-the-world scenario, this one is bare bones, as ugly and scary as it can get. McCarthy leaves very little room for hope. It's a desolate story he is weaving and he doesn't back down or flinch for a second. Gotta respect him for that. "

6288,1839096298,really liked it,"There is no later. This is later. All things that of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one's heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes. So, he whispered to the sleeping boy, I have you.In a post apocalyptic world, a man and his son walk the ruined and damaged earth of charred trees, ashy waters. Scavenging for food and always on the move, always hoping. This book is so stark and depressing that I had to read it in bits and portions but still has such heartbreakingly tender moments. I have never rooted for characters in fiction as I did for the pair and McCarthy's ability to deliver breathtaking yet precise words without overbearing paragraphs delving into description is outstanding.I found it interesting that McCarthy does not use quotation marks or semi colons in his prose.

6288,3183574,it was amazing,"Reading ""The Road"", you can focus on the surroundings, the post apocalyptic world, the devastation, loss and horror - it certainly is everywhere in this book. It would be easy to lose sight of hope. What does survive even in this austere and hostile place is the love of the father for his son, his memories of a world and a life with beauty, and integrity. Their trek is a journey of hope. In the bleakest of times if humanity survives, hope persists. "

6288,43150245,it was amazing,"Loved it in spite of Oprah. Gripping, wrenching, terrifying. "
6288,2019644231,it was amazing,"Authors often exploit a post-apocalyptic setting for vigilante heroics or for expounding a rebuke of human hubris. Cormac McCarthy circumvents these easy genre conventions. He uses it as a scalpel to peel away the layers defining humanity. Legal, social, cultural, philosophical and religious structure — gone! Strip away all that veneer and what remains? Even the will to survive is an inadequate answer.What is remarkable is McCarthy's ability to immerse the reader in this bleak landscape. He eschews a parade of horror at the outset. Instead, he provides disorienting examples of sensory erasure. The story opens at night. Only dreams have color.  “Waking in the cold dawn it all turned to ash instantly. Like certain ancient frescoes entombed for centuries suddenly exposed to the day.” (Location 195) A dream monster suggests the erasure of both form and color.  “And on the far shore a creature that raised its dripping mouth from the rimstone pool and stared into the light with eyes dead white and sightless as the eggs of spiders.” (Location 38) Sound is not an interruption of silence. It is silence in another form: the sound of rainfall and waterflow suggests in its monotony merely white noise. Even the sense of time has been erased.  “He thought the month was October but he wasnt sure. He hadnt kept a calendar for years.” (Location 38) McCarthy unsettles us with the notion of shifting memory as well. The very act of re-summoning a memory re-shapes it through context until memories become more fiction than private reality. The man attempts to preserve vestiges of some memories by wrapping them in the stories he tells his son. McCarthy forces us to witness the awfulness of these eroding memories. The man discards the photo of his dead wife, along with his useless wallet. He no longer understood how to keep her a part of their lives. He stops telling his son the stories. He shows the boy his childhood home but those memories are corrupted by the reality of its destroyed and vacant condition. The lacunae created by faded memories become filled with present horrors.  “You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.” (Location 116)Even the punctuation McCarthy has chosen, stripped of apostrophes, commas and quotation marks, reinforces a visual experience of absences.Death is everywhere. The characters must wear masks to filter out the ash that fills the air. At first, the human corpses McCarthy presents are uncannily ordinary, like stage-dressing or props:  “Fossil tracks in the dried sludge. A corpse in a doorway dried to leather.” (Location 109) McCarthy will save his horrors for more effective use. Against this landscape, the smallest chance intervals of relief are striking. The man propels the cart with his son and their possessions like a bobsledder, and elicits a smile. A field of dessicated apples in the dirt provides precious sustainance for another day or two. The two unnamed characters, the man and the boy, make their way through a ruined world. That anonymity is yet another erasure — of identities. It gives this story the feel of an allegory. McCarthy summons just such an image in his first paragraph:  “In the dream...he had wandered in a cave where the child led him by the hand. Their light playing over the wet flowstone walls. Like pilgrims in a fable swallowed up and lost among the inward parts of some granitic beast.” (Location 32)The third person narrative reinforces that allegorical feeling. Passages of dialog are spare: exchanges of fear, reassurance, impotence and resolve. Dreams are one of the few conduits into the man's inner thoughts. The man's dreams are never nightmares. That would confer too subjective a viewpoint. After all, the real nightmare is the world they inhabit.McCarthy's word choices promote a sense of temporal ambiguity. The “Fall” is represented literarily as well as literally, mined from historic, feral and primal suggestions. The man struggles to find his balance in the dark:  “An old chronicle. To seek out the upright. No fall but preceded by a declination. He took great marching steps into the nothingness, counting them against his return. Upright to what? Something nameless in the night, lode or matrix.” (Location 141) Lode: channel or burden? Matrix: mold or birth origin? (Look up the etymologies and definitions).McCarthy adheres to a disciplined agnosticism. God is both a thing longed for and a thing despised:  “Are you there? He whispered. Will I see you at last? Have you a neck by which to throttle you? Have you a heart? Damn you eternally have you a soul?” (Location 109) God is both animus and hollow promise. These contradictions appear later in the voice of an old man named Ely:  “Nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave.” (location 1573)  “There is no god and we are his prophets.” (Location 1582) (view spoiler)[ For this reason, I did not find the ending hopeful, but a continuation of McCarthy's questions about uncertainty. The man does not stay alive for himself, but for his son. As long as there is someone else to stay alive for, life is worth continuing. (hide spoiler)]McCarthy's answer to the question of what is left is uncertainty. Logic ordains that both the man and the boy will perish. Yet, time after time, they are lucky. They stumble upon a safe spot for the night, or a can of unspoiled rations. We watch these events with a similar uncertainty. As long as there is uncertainty, these two figures will continue to haunt our thoughts. I tried to read this book several years ago, and could not get beyond the first page. In the intervening time, something has changed. I no longer look upon human nature with optimism. With the loss of optimism, an acceptance of uncertainty may be all that connects us.NOTES:James Wood is always a reviewer worth reading.

6288,2512779951,really liked it,"Camminare su una spiaggia, dove a ogni passo fatto, l'impronta sulla sabbia svanisce al passaggio delle onde; questo provavo ogni volta che leggevo un paragrafo, dove quello precedente ormai non aveva più importanza, contava solo andare avanti e non voltarsi mai, un pò come quello che succede nella storia all'uomo e al bambino, nella loro infinita ricerca di un riparo, un rifugio, di calore, una speranza per continuare e non arrendersi."
6288,352867894,it was amazing,"CapolavoroL’ambientazione di questo intenso, enigmatico e struggente romanzo potrebbe indurre ad ascriverlo al filone fantascientifico, ma ogni classificazione sarebbe riduttiva come lo è sempre quando ci si trova di fronte a un autentico capolavoro letterario in assoluto. È il racconto di un viaggio, un cammino faticoso e irto di pericoli, per chilometri e chilometri attraverso un paesaggio desolato, incenerito e saccheggiato, con tutto ciò che si possiede trasportato su un malandato carrello della spesa. La catastrofe che si è abbattuta sul mondo ne ha cancellato ogni intervento operato dall’umanità e dalla natura nei secoli; la stessa civiltà, la storia e il progresso sono annientati, dimenticati. I pochi sopravvissuti al disastro non conservano più nulla di umano e vagano alla ricerca disperata di cibo, spaventati dagli orrori che vedono intorno a loro o imbestialiti dall’istinto di sopravvivenza. In questo paesaggio di buio, freddo, cenere, pioggia e devastazione brilla il legame tra un uomo e il suo bambino, padre e figlio non meglio identificati. Il loro rapporto è fatto di piccoli gesti, sguardi struggenti e brevi frasi concise che denotano uno sconfinato reciproco amore, senza cedimenti e senza incertezze. Spesso i loro ruoli sembrano addirittura invertirsi nel desiderio di protezione dell’altro, nelle manifestazioni di fiducia e nel sostegno che cercano di darsi a vicenda. La prosa secca ed essenziale è straordinariamente evocativa e ben si adatta alle atmosfere sterili e soffocanti, alla disperata malinconia dei ricordi e alla lucida disillusione presente. Anche nello stile, tuttavia, guizzano a tratti inattesi bagliori che con la loro intensità colpiscono al cuore il lettore come lame affilate. (view spoiler)[A livello interpretativo l’opera offre diverse chiavi di lettura da quella morale (l’uomo e il bambino “portatori del fuoco”, ovvero dell’amore o, meglio, della pietas in senso latino) a quella messianica (il bambino come ‘l’atteso’, redentore dell’umanità smarrita e fondatore di una nuova era che nasce dalle rovine del passato).  (hide spoiler)]In qualunque modo lo si voglia intendere, comunque, il romanzo conserva la sua incredibile forza di suggestione e le sue qualità di perfezione stilistica e di contenuti. Splendido il passaggio finale."

Like they often say, you don't appreciate things until they're gone - and, in this case, I was starting to sincerely appreciate proper grammar.I'm slightly joking. The concise, spare, and experimental prose served McCarthy's purpose well in this story. It conveyed the themes of the book and touched on many truths of mankind in general. I give props to Cormac McCarthy for some of his more pulchritudinous passages:""No list of things to be done. The day providential to itself. The hour. There is no later. This is later. All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one's heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes. So, he whispered to the sleeping boy. I have you.""The Road has received myriad lauds and a lot of love. Despite this, I didn't effusively enjoy the book. The stilted writing style made it difficult for me to connect with the characters. Near the end of the novel, I remember annotating ""this is the scene where I should be crying... but I'm not."" I recognize the feat McCarthy has achieved by publishing this heartbreaking post-apocalyptic novel, but, personally, I couldn't bring myself to like it more than any other okay book. Possibly because for every wonderfully-written passage or page, I had to trudge through 25 average ones.Overall, I would recommend The Road to those who find pleasure in reading about dark, despairing situations as well as those who like experimental, post-apocalyptic fiction. The relationship between the father and his son acts as the best attribute of the book, as it reminds readers of the strength of human connection and how much love can endure and accomplish.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."
6288,263562641,did not like it,"I've waited a few days after finishing to write something about this book, hoping to achieve a fair and balanced opinion of this Pulitzer-prize winning novel.And trying to figure out WHY it won said prize.I think it's a Harry Potter thing. I may have mentioned this before, but a friend told me a story about her non-fantasy-reading friend, who read a Harry Potter novel. Said person was like, ""Wow! It was AMAZING! It's like the author created a Whole Different World!"" The concept had never occurred to her, let alone that there's a whole genre of novels that ""create whole new worlds.""Likewise, I think the people that are impressed by ""The Road"" have probably never read a post-apocalyptic novel.Maybe it's just that I read the 1965 novel by John Christopher ""The Ragged Edge"" just a couple of months ago, and it's fresh in my mind... but, IMHO, ""The Road"" verges on plagiarism. It's the SAME EXACT STORY. OK, so ""The Road"" takes place a little bit further after the disaster, and the kid travelling with the man through the post-apocalyptic wasteland is his biological son, not an adopted orphan, and ""The Ragged Edge"" has a few more characters thrown in. But they've even got nearly the same scene on a ship! How likely is that?Basically, I think Cormac McCarthy probably read the other novel at some point, said, ""I can do this better,"" and threw in some religious allegory, made it clear that Man was responsible for the disaster (although that's hardly original, either), and wrote it in poetic language. But you know what? I LIKE full sentences and punctuation. OK, occasionally sentence fragments can be used effectively. But the whole book is sentence fragments! And leaving out apostrophes from contractions is just distracting, annoying, and serves no poetic purpose.Ah well; I am sure many readers out there will disagree with me, but that's my honest opinion!"

Sure, I recognized the sparse writing style which lent an artsy feel to the prose (and was probably what earned it the Pulitzer and is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1), but the book was an ordeal from start to finish. It had no purpose what so ever except to make the reader feel like they were in a post-apocalyptic world where hope had been completely extinguished … and it worked. Ultimately that is what doomed the book with me … at the end I sat back and simply asked a very basic question … So? Was there a message? Maybe … life goes on? Egads, even the interminable “and so it goes” from slaughter house five was better then this drekk. What about the relationship between the father and the son? Was it really love, so was it simple a reason to continue? I don’t really know, but I suspect that there really was not as much there as it would seem. The boy’s existence was simply an enabler for the father’s continued existence. Neither character showed any character development over some 287 pages so what really was the point of the story? I have happily traded this book away on book mooch.com"

Sin embargo, a McCarthy una justificación tal le resulta superflua. Además, el mundo que construye es simple. Más allá de los paisajes devastados y el estado de abandono de las zonas residenciales, no describe nada más. Tampoco lo necesita. Ni siquiera se esfuerza por redactar un texto dinámico, en el que ocurran demasiadas cosas. Algunos momentos de tensión, muy circunscritos.

Through their journey -the man and child-, we see how the relationship between the two is extremely strong. The father, through it all, emphasized on the importance of how the child must ""carry the fire"" and be one of the good guys.It was a good book, I would recommend it for those who like the post-apocalyptic genre."

6288,74321283,really liked it,"The Road was a 2-star novel until the last EIGHT pages, at which I actually shed tears, then immediately awarded 4-stars. (Truth be told, if I re-reviewed Cormac McCarthy's book sometime in the near- to mid-future, which I never do, I might retroactively award 5 stars.) Why? Why so mercurial? Why all this fuss? Why not an unequivocal appraisal?Because the last EIGHT pages whipsawed me to a place the preceding pages were unable to take me. The last pages unveiled a vision of the story I had previously missed. The ending was quick, not altogether unexpected, but it amplified the message the book was steadily making right in front of me the whole time, while, glibly, I ambled along at 400 words per minute.The Road is a story simply of a boy and his Papa trudging their way to the coast in a purposely undefined post-apocalyptic America. They remain unnamed, without personal description, and there are only four other characters whose total combined dialogue would fit on one-half a page. So in essence, this is a Waiting-For-Godot-style interaction between father and son. The story is written with overriding asepticism so McCarthy could focus us on the relationship between two characters. Brilliant. The characters and the apocalypse are purposely undefined; the dialogue is purposely truncated and staccato; there are no chapters—on purpose; hell, there aren't even any quotation marks in the whole book! Background, narration, foreshadowing, author's voice—things critical to fiction—are all eliminated from The Road as unnecessary accouterments, plebeian writing tools, sophomoric things that would only get in the way of the simple but powerful relationship. And the result is a story distilled to its essence.On their way to the coast, we glimpse how humans become feral after the annihilation of civilization. We realize how difficult survival would be in this gray world. Other authors would pursue the images or emotion of a burnt world. McCarthy is on an opposite tack. You, the reader, must landscape almost the entire exterior.The last EIGHT pages made me realize that The Road is actually a poem in disguise. I'm not a big fan of poetry, and that's why I was breezing through. Stop. But I know from poetry that simplicity, rhythm, chorus, and the absolute precision of word selection and placement has a synergistic effect on the whole. So, McCarthy has written an epic poem of filial love, again, distilled to its essence. The words between father and son are simple, direct, and lyrical. There is a universe of meaning within--just like the simplest poems of Robert Frost or Emily Dickinson. Some may find this a haunting story. Some may feel this a beautiful, hopeful story. Maybe people feel it's a haunting story simply because they do find beauty in a such a horrible, terminal environment. Either way The Road won a Pulitzer because it touched so many people in such a visceral way. Visceral, and yet, I betcha that many people don't know why.McCormick did something I found very neat with his language. He covered the reader with a tide of obscure vocabulary, some I couldn't even find in the dictionary. The word 'salitter' for example; it's only--and most recent--use was apparently in a poem from the 18th century. However, 'salitter' and the other words have such an exacting definition and relevance to the story, that I look back and realize, like poetry, McCormack was compressing his story and needed to imbue every word with the most perfect meaning available to the English language. New words: pipeclayed, firedrake, rachitic, siwash, claggy, woad, chert, patterans, windrow, wrack, tidewrack, isocline, salitter, crozzled, loess"

Yet, The Road is surprisingly hopeful (on a Cormac McCarthy scale), presenting a world filled with the same unfathomable darkness and mystery that characterizes most of McCarthy's work, yet showing two people who struggle on regardless of that darkness: a father and his son, who ""carry the flame."" We never learn why nearly everything is dead. As is often the case with McCarthy's work, he leaves out the details that aren't essential. What we do know is that a man survived a huge event that killed nearly everything, and he has a young son. The son was born after the event happened, and only knows what he's heard from his father about the world before. With a map that is so old that it's a bunch of numbered pieces, they trace their path to the coast. They travel toward the coast for the sake of having some destination, although they don't know what they'll find there.As always, McCarthy's writing is evocative, sparse and with the customary lack of punctuation. He could write books with no plot and just description and they'd still be worth reading. But the relationship between the father and his son is what makes The Road such a terrific book. The dialogue between them is just so fraggin good. McCarthy doesn't need to tell you anything about their relationship, about their feelings, about their struggles: it all comes through naturally in their conversation. It's all so believable, so natural, and often so hilarious. The father is struggling to survive, but he's more concerned about keeping his son alive. The son is often angered by the fact that they can't save everyone they come across. The father often makes small concessions to the son, but when they come across a starving old man, he refuses to do more than give him a meal and let him stay with them for one night. He remains a realist about their very limited resources and their ability to truly trust others. The biggest threats are starvation and dehydration, but they also have to watch out for the organized groups of cannibals who roam the road. It seems that more humans survived the apocalypse than any other kind of animal, or else the humans were able to survive the aftermath better. Either way, many people have turned to cannibalism, since it is the most readily available type of food. This makes some of the meetings with other people out on the road quite scary, since our main characters don't know what to expect from any chance encounters.So, why is it five stars? I don't often give books a full five, but I feel The Road deserves it because of a combination of factors. 1: The characters are full and rich and believable and I loved them. 2: This is the strongest depiction of a post-apocalyptic world that I've encountered in fiction or in film. You never need to suspend your disbelief; everything feels too real for the fantasy to be even slightly fractured. 3: The book is concise, taking less than 300 pages to tell its complete story (which has a surprisingly strong ending considering the bleakness of the world). And, 4: looking back, I can't find anything at all to fault. I recommend this one to any and everyone."
6288,2162841848,it was amazing,"Trostlosigkeit, alles ist grau. Nachts ist kein Mond sichtbar, die Tage sind kurz, die Sonne wird nie wirklich sichtbar. Alles ist von Asche bedeckt. Nichts lebt, die Bäume sind tot, die Pflanzen, es gibt keine Tiere. Nur ein paar Menschen. Sie scheiden sich in die Bösen, deren Überlebensstrategie Kannibalismus heißt. Und dann gibt es die Guten, unter ihnen ein Vater und sein Sohn. Sie bleiben namenlos. Sie versuchen sich von alten Konserven, die sie hier und da finden, zu ernähren. Sie frieren, erleben Nässe, sind müde und hungrig, fliehen auf ihrem Weg in den Süden immer wieder vor den Bösen. Das ist an Trostlosigkeit nicht zu überbieten und obwohl auf ihrem Weg so sehr viel nicht passiert, bzw. nur Dinge, die für jeden Leser erwartbar sind, ist das ungemein fesselnd. Das liegt an der beklemmenden Tristesse, aber mehr noch an der Schilderung dieser Vater-Sohn-Beziehung. Der Vater recht nüchtern, lediglich um das Überleben des Sohnes bemüht, daher zwangsläufig misstrauisch und pragmatisch, der Sohn immer wieder Mitleid empfindend – mit einem Hund, einem Kind, einem alten Mann. Zwei Geisteshaltungen, die nicht nur einen Generationenkonflikt andeuten oder ihr Lebensalter zu charakterisieren zu scheinen, sondern Haltungen, wie man zu einer Gesellschaft stehen kann, die es hier garnicht mehr gibt. Das ist eines der düstersten, schwärzesten Bücher, die ich je gelesen habe. Und dennoch ist es voll Liebe, Hoffnung und Menschlichkeit."
6288,28698683,liked it,"8/6 -- OK... I finished this last night, and am still pondering it. I had an idea about this book before I started, although I tried not to bias my own opinion before I even started the book by reading the opinions of others. This book caught me off-guard. I enjoyed the book as a whole. After the first few pages I was sucked in and lost in this gray existence, which is exactly what it is... existence, and barely that. After the first few pages, I had trouble finding a place to stop for the night and remember thinking that it was oddly fitting that I should have such a problem. My boyfriend asked me what the book was about, as I dragged it along with me for the better part of two evenings. (The poor guy didn't see my eyes the entire time.) I found that it was hard to describe to him... I tried to explain it, but he's not much of a reader, so he was disinterested, to say the least. I finally told him that it is the story of a man trying to ensure the survival of his son, and their journey to find a place where they can live. I tried to convey to him the constant sense of the father almost willing life to appear while at the same time mistrusting it and trying to make sure that his son doesn't lose the hope he holds of finding it. As far as the writing itself, it seemed to me that it was like a non-stop series of snapshots and memory-clips coming together to make a mosaic that are the characters' lives. No breaks in the story, no rest for the weary. About 10 pages from the end, I thought that the only glimmer of ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" would come in the form of a potentially overlooked seedling or something similar... That would have been a decent ending in my mind, but the actual one in the book is better, I think. All in all, I am glad that I read this one. "
6288,1361766238,it was amazing,"S.P.L.E.N.D.I.DDo you guys remember that Green Day song that you thought was about your high school;That's a costum design for this book , or maybe not. Anywas.I'm aching and sobbing internally after reading this book. It was too dark but it was realistic, and I was cringing the whole time I was reading, and I just want to get it out of my system but I know I won't EVER be able to forget it or not think about it, perhaps for every single day of my life.It was dark, it was gloomy, it was sad, it was MISERABLE. But I LOVED it. The little boy and his father's love for him were the only good left in the world, I WANNA CRY! Even despite the fact that it is not exactly what you would call a story, but just a journey instead. I sat for a while contemplating what I just read after I finished it, and tears flowed and flowed. I imagined the world to look something like this, but it was also covered with ash, so you could only imagine how it would be like to breath, let alone live there. This felt to me like yu could either go 1/5 or 5/5 with it, I would not think of an inbetween. And it certainly does deserve a five, I really don't simply give 5 stars. However, this book is one of those that i wish I never read because I know it would haunt me for good."
6288,18665246,really liked it,"Maybe 70K words formatted to fill 287 pages, as quick a read as ""Bridget Jones,"" but not as applicable to one's life? A simple story. The perfect beach read for pessimistic survivalists. A typical Cormac Mc world: unrelentingly humorless, brutal, often gorgeous (and often over-the-top) Faulknerian prose (""unremembered,"" ""unravaged,"" etc), small oases of masculine affection among endless acres of burnt earth. As it's suggested in the book, the story itself is a nightmare we need to dream or else we've given up. Memorable. Worthwhile. Incredible ability to help you imagine scenes and landscapes through a pane of quick, spare, evocative prose. But subtextually it didn't seem to me on the same level as other otherworldly allegories like Blindness or Waiting for the Barbarians, maybe 'cause, in general there's something in McCarthy's prose that I respect but don't quite fully buy? Or maybe because this one's more about individual survival (as in his typical high-lit ""Westerns"") against starvation, the elements, stray bad guys etc, than the survival of societies, or surviving within one that's gone totally wacky? Anyway, definitely an enjoyable book about the destruction of humanity and the endurance of what's human, or some Oprah-ready blurboid like that. "
6288,1807601152,it was amazing,"2nd time reading this book. Have raised it one more star to a five.This book has me feeling very emotional. I knew what was going to happen but this time it really hit me with a punch. I don't know if it's being older and feeling the weight of what it means to be a parent. Being aware of one's mortality and knowing you will leave your child behind. What makes it worse is that the father is leaving his child in an apocalyptic world filled with bad guys, men who are cannibals. He must hold on long enough to find a safe place and good people with who to leave his son with. It's heart wrenching. The author does a great job of depicting a gray, barren world. The writing and dialogue is simple and subtle, fitting in with the scarcity of this new world, the despair that's all around them. And yet for all its bleakness, there is also the love this father has for his child, and it's the motivation that keeps this father going, this need to keep his child alive and safe. It's this love that's the sole source of light in this horrible new world.My heart couldn't take the end. I had to let the tears flow. "
6288,103304327,it was ok,"This book reminded me why I don't like ""literary"" fiction much -- Cormac McCarthy may be a polished writer who can turn a neat phrase, but that's pretty much all this story is. Strip away the repetitive, blunt dialogs between ""The Man"" and ""The Boy"" and McCarthy's carefully crafted descriptions of walking, hiding, opening jars, etc., and you've got a tale of a man and a boy walking down an endless road in a post-apocalyptic landscape. They walk and walk and walk and now and then they encounter someone, and then they walk some more, until the end. That's it. That's the story.I know, I'm supposed to appreciate McCarthy's beautiful, sparse prose, and the emotional depth conveyed by the father and son with these beautiful, sparse words. I got that. But I'd like a plot with the pretty words, please."
6288,45514509,it was amazing,"Spartan and bleak. Short and sharp and raw. Emotionally wrenching even when nothing much is happening. Better than I could have ever imagined a story set in a post-apocalypse wasteland could be. I really did like The Stand and all (let the record show 4 stars), but The Road makes The Stand look like so much Stephenie Meyer prattle. Sorry Mr. King, but in the immortal words of our esteemed president, Mr. McCarthy didn't just beat you, he spanked you.(I can say that about Mr. King because normally I count myself among his proponents and am confident he'll never read it.)As much as I enjoyed--no, that's not the right word--was captivated by The Road, I can't see it making a good movie. Viggo Mortensen will have to share top billing with the color grey. Hope I'm wrong."

Ο σκοτεινός κόσμος που παρουσιάζει μοιάζει τόσο όμορφος μέσα από την σχέση που χτίζεται μεταξύ πατέρα και γιου. Κι στιγμή δεν κουράζεσαι στην ανάγνωση του, καθε στιγμή κι ένα καινούργιο στοιχείο, μια νέα έκπληξη για τους ήρωες παρουσιάζεται και σε ξυπνά, σου ταράζει τα μέλη και τα αισθήματα.

6288,168543595,it was amazing,"A father and his young son walk along the road in a post-apocalyptic time. There is nothing alive except for a few lawless people that they must hide from. Ash covers the earth, and their only food is what they can scavange from abandoned homes. A pistol with two bullets is their only defense. In this bleak, dark journey to the warmer southern coast, the sole brightness is the love and devotion between the father and the son. The Road is a beautifully written, riveting story that I could not put down."
6288,145095071,it was amazing,"This is a very good book. Yes, it is bleak and uncompromising. Yes, it is unbearable at times. But the tale being told is absolutely compelling. The bond between the father and son is so true - to me at least. It affected me profoundly, particularly as when I read it my youngest son was the same age as the child in the book. It was so easy to imagine myself in the same position as the father in the book. Sadly if it were me it would have been a short book - we would have been dead by page 25."
6288,2137161736,it was amazing,"This book is not for everyone. The tale is beautiful, dark and poignant, with no Deus Ex to save the day. ****** Vague Spoilers Below **************The point of this story is not that ""everything will be OK"". The point is that this father loves his son completely, and is staying alive only to protect him. As with all McCarthy books, the true purpose of reading him is his mastery over language. The prose/imagery are magnificent."
6288,1770130096,it was ok,"This book honestly just dragged for me. I found it to be rather repetitive. Granted, the dialogue is unique, but unfortunately it really didn't work for me. With this being a Pulitzer prize winner too, I really did expect more from this book. I feel like it's a damn shame I've had to give this book a two star rating, when it seems to be a book that is loved by many. "
6288,359079283,liked it,Such a dark and depressing book. I remember watching the movie. I would hope that our world would never get to become this horribly depressing and dangerous where all you are trying to do is survive and not be killed by others.

6288,2590330830,really liked it,"La novela narra los últimos días de los últimos habitantes del planeta Tierra, en un escenario postpostapocalíptico (y digo postpost porque creo que hay muchas historias en las que la tragedia que terminó con todo acaba de ocurrir y se narran las estrategias de supervivencia de muchos y las muertes multitudinarias; acá todo eso ya pasó, ya se acabó todo, ya se murió todo, toda la vegetación ha desaparecido, todos los animales, quedan sólo los ejemplares más resistentes, o los más necios, o los más suertudos, que luchan por sobrevivir porque... pues porque eso viene escrito en el ADN de toda criatura viva; por ahí hay un perro, por ahí una orquídea).No sabemos qué pasó: una guerra nuclear o un nuevo meteoro en Chicxulub. Lo único que sabemos es que todo se quemó, que no se filtra por la atmósfera un solo rayo de sol y que han pasado unos cinco o siete años (quizá más) desde la tragedia. De la reacción humana ante la catástrofe quedan huellas: un desterrado de las comunas al que le han cortado los dedos de una mano, un grupo de caníbales, un sótano lleno de personas listas para morir y ser comidas. La novela no se detiene ni en la descripción de estos grupos ni en su conformación, sino que sigue a un padre y a un hijo que se dirigen hacia el sur por la carretera. La anécdota es ésa y sólo esa, no pasa nada más. Pero las 200 páginas de la novela permiten que el lector se adentre en la desesperación y el hambre, que avance con los personajes esperando que algo ocurra, que el hallazgo de una bodega llena de conservas cambie para siempre su suerte. Vemos morir el lenguaje; vemos estrecharse a cada paso los límites finísimos entre ""lo bueno"" y ""lo malo"", conceptos con los que el hombre ha educado a este niño que nació en el nuevo mundo; aceptamos la muerte como la única salida lógica y, con los personajes, esperamos que eso no tenga que pasar justo ahora.La novela, en resumen, me gustó mucho. Me llenó de tristeza y de culpa (y de ganas de comer fruta). No me convence la ausencia de mujeres (las que aparecen son cobardes, están embarazadas o son la compañía de hombres, porque el machismo es lo último que va a desaparecer en este mundo). El lenguaje es parco y directo, sin melodrama, aunque con momentos líricos, plagados de construcciones unimembres, que pueden llegar a cansar."

6288,32476715,did not like it,"Oh my god.A few question for our friend Cormac McCarthy:Why don’t you use quotation marks ever, or apostrophes all the time? Do you really think that clever little device is going to make or break our experience of the desolate, spare, bleak world you have created for us? You don’t think you’ve pounded it into our heads enough in other ways? I just don't go for cheap gimmicks like that.Why do so many of your sentence fragments lack verbs? And when they do contain verbs, don’t you think a disproportionate number of them are really just nouns that you’ve inappropriately turned into verbs? Is this supposed to add to the feeling of stagnant claustrophobia you’re shoving down my throat? Would you ever use a phrase like stagnant claustrophobia, or would you say something like “A mute void, black and still. The dust. Hands heavy like ham hocks.”Why do you continually use adjectives so poorly? And by the way (to quote what appears to be a favorite passage):“He rose and stood tottering in that cold autistic dark with his arms outheld for balance while the vestibular calculations in his skull cranked out their reckonings.” Really? Vestibular calculations? Don’t you think that’s a tad ‘wordy’ for your style? Why can’t you say ‘outstretched’ instead of ‘outheld?’ ‘Autistic dark?’ ‘Cranked out their reckonings?’ You’re creating all sorts of weirdo competing imagery here. I mean, I get that you’re all about creating emotions and sensations about the environment and the characters’ experience. I’m mostly wondering why you don’t just write poetry. That seems like the perfect medium for you. You clearly can’t be bothered with stringing a sentence together correctly, using punctuation, or developing your ideas in a sequential manner. Why don’t you think these conventions should apply to you? This seems pretentious to me. As a side note, I conducted a short experiment. I flipped to pages, at random, and seven times in a row the first paragraph I looked at contained information about someone sleeping, going to sleep, or just waking up. Doesn’t that sound like fun? Also, am I the only one who noticed that the boy, who by all means has known nothing other than this abandoned, ash-covered, post-apocalyptic world, immediately started making truck noises when they came across an abandoned truck? Now, it is possible that he has witnessed a few trucks riding by, but every time they encounter strangers they fear for their lives and hide. This kind of reaction to people and cars doesn’t exactly foster the habit of making playful sound effects. Is this a recent development? Was there once a time when people, after the “event,” were driving around in trucks, honking their horns and revving the engines for the boy to witness and admire? Maybe next he can find a machine gun on the ground and start playing Rambo. I’m pretty sure he hasn’t had access to television or movies. This just didn’t fit in with the story McCarthy was writing. As another reviewer pointed out, this kid is written like a child who was ripped from a normal suburban childhood and suddenly placed in this desolate world, not one who had never known anything else. That is just sloppy.P.S. I’m mostly just mad that this guy receives so much praise, and from what I can tell, he isn’t putting much effort into his writing. Come on, the Pulitzer? Josh and I were both reading at the same time, and it was embarrassing (for McCarthy) because I would read a passage from The Road and Josh would read one from The Three Musketeers and it was just so obvious that we aren’t holding authors to the same standards we used to. UPDATE: I have finished the book. I started to think it was getting better, but then I realized I was just desperately clinging to anything remotely resembling action. No, finding a bunch of canned goods for the third or fourth time isn't exciting plot development. Running into some other people (Oh no! Look! The ""bad guys!"" Hey, there's a ""good guy!"") a few times and seeing that they are either starving as well or trying to eat some naked people is mildly interesting, but you can't carry an entire book on it. Yes, I understand that the characters have to suffer through the same old shit every day. But they're characters. Why did he invent them? Why should I be reading about them? What message is he trying to send that hasn't been sent before? This was one of the most simplistic, childish, self-aggrandizing, condescending, boring books I have ever read. I think even the copy editors become bored with it, or at least stopped trying because every time they would make a correction Cormac McCarthy would slap them and say, ""You ridiculous plebeian fool! I meant to leave that apostrophe out/choose a random word/repeat the same paragraph as before."" That is the only explanation I have for the following sentence on page 35: ""They ate the little mushrooms together with the beans and drank tea and had tinned pears for their desert."""
6288,2309278379,it was amazing," I read this as part of my self-created 2018 Challenge to read a book a month from the last 12 years of my TBR lists. ( I organize these lists by year of publication.) The Road won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007. I have seen the movie and I have owned the book for many years but somehow never picked it up to read. It is fitting that I did so now since my reading this year is turning out to be littered with post apocalyptic fiction.From the movie I have indelible images of the devastated land through which a man and his son travel, the ash, the gray skies, the almost utter lack of living creatures except for a few desperate human beings. The cold, the hunger, and the fear.From the book I got even more of a sense of this father who has nothing and no one left in his life except his son. The boy is quite young, though his age is never specifically given. I pictured him to be about 7 or 8 years old. It is as if the father must protect his son and try to get him to some semblance of safety as a last gasp of human agency.This bleak disturbing tale takes the road trip novel to new depths. We are accustomed to road trips that take place in cars. The father and his son walk hundreds of miles south in a footrace against winter. The story moves at a walking pace, sometimes a very slow walk, as they push their grocery cart of belongings through mud and slush, but it is a trip taken mostly on the remains of the roads we take for granted in our current lives.Am I glad I read it? Overall the answer is yes. For the power of McCarthy's writing. For the reminder of what human beings will do for someone they love. Mostly for the realization that came over me days after I finished it. We don't know what lies ahead. Will mankind figure out ways to counter the forces of climate change, terrorism and the mushroom cloud that still hovers over our consciousness? Most of us will not live long enough to know.My realization was that whatever our place is in creation, it was not meant to be as an annihilating, destructive force. Mankind as a species throughout recorded history has committed deeds of small and large scale annihilation and destruction but so has nature. If you believe your holy books, your mythology books, so have the gods. The main thread though, as depicted in much of the fiction I read, is the life force, the will to survive, and love, all of which are in abundance even when forced near to extinction from time to time.

6288,1912202255,it was amazing,"Creo que no tengo palabras. De verdad, no sé qué decir de este libro: me ha dejado, literalmente, sin palabras."
6288,1516610119,really liked it,"In Cormac McCarthy's The Road the reader awakens in the stifling presence of a darkness and denseness in prose and scene that strikes full-bodied from the start. Rarely is a breath of relief offered, its oft poetic lines being rhythmic strikes on anvils rather than reprieve. A father and son desperately travel towards the coast along a road layered in shifting ash. America has burned; nothing is left at their backs but terror and hunger. What little lies forward may be equally consumed. I haven't read McCarthy previously so I can't speak to comparisons with other works. I have read rather a lot of dystopian fiction, possibly more than my share. I think I'm always looking for another Margaret Atwood, as in The Handmaid's Tale, a dystopic fiction that pervades and stirs up. Some are decent, some are atmospheric enough to entrench me fairly firmly in the plot and characters, some are Cormac McCarthy apparently. It took some time for the story to captivate. Eventually the narration became a deep throated hum, its rhythm lathing the read. The Road is a brutal story; father and son carry each other as embers in the gloom but the gloom coats like amber. There is very little backstory; McCarthy keeps the reader pinned to the present and bloody. Introspection and action become alloy and there are many quotes my brain remains saturated in such as,“No lists of things to be done. The day providential to itself. The hour. There is no later. This is later. All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one's heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes.” Beautiful words on the escape of time, an acceptance of futility, ""and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.”Such that you wonder at this father's whys even as you understand them. The road crushes and maims and he continues to""...raise his weeping eyes and see him standing there in the road looking back at him from some unimaginable future, glowing in that waste like a tabernacle.""I think my rating hinges on experience. It's flitted from 3.5 to 4 to 5 stars in quick succession and I've landed on 4 without complete conviction. If I'd picked up the thread of its rhythm sooner, if some dialogue hadn't snipped the thread for me at places, this would be, easily, a five star read. From someone who is embarrassingly trepid about audiobooks, I wish I'd first listened to this rather than reading it. Still, I consider it a new favorite. "
6288,958213556,it was amazing," Review posted at That Cozy Book NookI want to begin by saying that The Road is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece. Period. Okay, glad we got that out of the way…Upon finishing this book, I found that I could not review it right away. Not because I had to think about whether I enjoyed it or not (I most certainly did), but because I felt so numbed by its content, that I couldn’t really put my thoughts into words. Now I can, so let’s see how this goes.When I think about it, saying that I “enjoyed” The Road feels strange. How does one “enjoy” a book about an un-named father and son making their way through a smoldering and ruined America? How does one “enjoy” a book that makes their stomach queasy and leaves them with a migraine that for lasted two days? Is such a thing possible? Maybe, maybe not. I will say, however, that I felt an undeniable and raw connection to the characters on their harrowing journey of survival.The writing is absolutely brilliant, and the lack of proper punctuation only added to the overall dark, yet fascinating setting of the book. Cormac McCarthy forced me to think about the things I love and value in a way that I had never considered before. The Road made me realize me realize how something like your own name-something that we can take so much pride in-is so trivial in a land of war, death, and unimaginable desperation.Each obstacle this father and son encountered left me on edge. When they were starving, I genuinely felt like I was starving. When they were freezing, I was as well. Them finding scraps of food felt like my own personal triumph, one that nearly reduced me to tears. New characters made me wary. In gruesome and grueling situations, I could not look away.I say all of this to mean that The Road is the only book I’ve had to put down periodically because I was so emotionally and physically drained. McCarthy paints such a vivid picture of this bleak world that I felt like I’d literally been walking the road with these characters. It was a reading experience unlike anything I have ever had before, and I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Not to sound overly dramatic, but this novel is, in some respects, life-changing. It has also made me curious to pick up Cormac McCarthy’s other works as well.If you have yet to read The Road, I say what are you waiting for? This sits at the height of quality fiction, apocalyptic or otherwise. I am happy to say that this is now one of my favorite books of all time."
6288,53477638,it was amazing,"I am haunted. A gauze of despair curtains my senses as I reflect on a book that I did not want to embrace yet could not escape from page one. I cannot extract myself from this nightmare, nor am I sure I want to because the utter grayness of the book perversely affirms something deep inside me. Call it humanity.I believe McCarthy's Pulitzer prize-winning novel reaches the soul in a way few books can. It penetrates uniquely into a man's soul and finds his rawest vulnerability: fatherhood. Though women will find the narrative equally compelling, as a father six times over I could not set the book aside until I knew whether the protagonist would succeed in his hopeless mission to protect his young son from a post-apocalyptic, burned-out world. Their heartbreaking, plodding search for a safe haven -- when it becomes increasingly obvious that there is no such place in their ruined world -- is a humbling metaphor for the supposed security a father works diligently to provide for his family.For most fathers, the stable house of cards one is able to construct generally suffices. Danger does not come, sniffing and snarling, to blow down our feeble attempts at shelter. But I have observed men who have suffered a personal apocalypse in the form of a child lost to untimely death, or worse, a violent end. These men are never the same. They seem to walk -- as the nameless protagonist in The Road -- a gray, merciless, ashen path, unable to securely enfold the ones they love. Beyond the existential contemplation the book triggers, it also earns my praise for its stylistic courage. The shedding of conventional punctuation not only schools the reader in the dramatic circumstances faced by the characters, but it also parallels their gradual descent into a shared cultural amnesia. Alas, it must be said: if you are even mildly depressed or if you have recently lost a loved one, do not read this book now, or possibly ever. Spare yourself. You've experienced enough grief and sadness; you don't need McCarthy to refresh your wounds. For the rest, grit your teeth, the road ahead is dark, even though you must walk it."

We’re the walking dead in a horror film.""""People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didnt believe in that. Tomorrow wasnt getting ready for them. It didnt even know they were there.""The Road is a novel about a boy and his father trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world where most of the humans left are turned into cannibals in the name of survival. But this you probably already know. What you may not know is that Cormac McCarthy takes a cliche theme into a whole new level. You won't find blood-thirsty zombies here. The bad guys our two heroes always try to escape, are hardly ever encountered. It's not about gore or suspense or cheap hollywood tricks. The story focuses mainly on the father-taking-care-of-the-son concept and everything that comes with it. What is lost, what there will never be again are the ever-present demons that haunt the unnamed father while he tries to not only keep his son alive, but also maintain the ideas of fairness, decency and goodness in the child's heart. All this in a world gone terribly wrong.McCarthy's writing style is tricky. While I was reading, I kept hearing a voice in my head that was emotionless, although desperate, and a bit robotic. His run-on sentences too can be frustrating. However, for some reason I had the feeling that this particular style was serving the story quite well. That said, I can see why many people disliked it. The strong point of McCarthy's writing though, is his descriptions of the sceneries. There's something dark, poetic and kind of Steinbeck-ish about them that makes you shiver.The way he manages to combine beauty with utter destruction and desperation is undescribable. Abandoned towns, farmhouses, forests, even a beach are a few of the places McCarthy takes you to. All destroyed, all decaying.Concluding, The Road is one of those novels that make you realize that there's always room for authenticity, even in themes about which you think you've seen it all."

Siamo in un futuro post-apocalittico, dove la Terra è ridotta in cenere, i paesaggi grigi e desolati, battuti da un vento gelido e scarsamente illuminati dal sole ormai debole e malaticcio, si susseguono uno dopo l’altro e, in mezzo a questa desolazione, si stagliano le figure di un padre e di un figlio, senza nome, senza alcuna connotazione fisica, uniti dall’affetto reciproco e decisi a proseguire il proprio viaggio nella speranza di poter raggiungere l’oceano e, di conseguenza, trovare condizioni di vita più favorevoli. Con loro hanno un carrello con lo scarso cibo che riescono a rimediare, un telo per la pioggia, una pistola e poco altro. Durante il cammino sulla “strada” si corre continuamente il rischio di incontrare banditi, vecchi moribondi, mangiatori di bambini, esseri che hanno ormai perso la propria umanità e la cosa più difficile in questo mondo devastato non è imparare ad uccidere, ma conservare il rispetto di sè, il “fuoco” che portiamo dentro. La storia in sè non mi ha sconvolta più di tanto, i dialoghi sono scarni e piuttosto ripetitivi, se si escludono alcuni momenti molto lirici ed essendo io un’amante dei distopici, forse qualche dettaglio in più su come si sia giunti ad uno scenario così catastrofico non mi sarebbe dispiaciuto. Nonostante tutto però non posso non riconoscere a McCarthy una grande dote, che è quella di saper scegliere le parole con estrema bravura, esprimendo con poche pennellate una miriade di colori ed emozioni potentissime. Poche frasi brevi, punteggiatura ridotta all’osso, ma una scrittura intensa, che colpisce dritta allo stomaco. Sicuramente un autore che voglio approfondire."
6288,1563193,really liked it,"I've read some very good and some very bad reviews of this book here on goodreads. I think the distinction is that those who totally misinterpreted ""The Road"" are not acquainted with the rest of McCarthy's work. One review went on and on about how the father and son were anthropomorphisms of ""Survival"" and ""Compassion."" Total nonsense. This is not an allegory. This is not a moral lesson. McCarthy's universe, like his prose, is distilled, stark, and barbaric. True, given the dystopian setting, we must accept that the reality of the novel is ultimately representational; however, we needn't suppose that this representation is any further removed than the distance between any fictional text and the reality of the world it purports to describe. The Road can not be approached critically divorced from the rest of McCarthy's canon. In fact, I conceive of this novel as a footnote, an excursis, of a unitary statement which exists inside the McCarthian universe. The content of that statement is what makes the book interesting, and that McCarthy saw fit to write an entire novel on it ought to foster critical dialogue. It also lies outside the scope of this little review here, and certainly outside of adolescent tricks of allegory and superficial symbolism. The only point I want to make here is that exactly what I have been talking about also makes me furious when I remember that this is the book for which McCarthy won the Pulitzer. To give ""The Road"" the Pulitzer -- and not, say, ""Blood Meridian,"" or ""The Crossing"" -- could only result from a total miscomprehension of McCarthy, and a yielding to pop pressure. For this offense, Oprah should be hanged."
6288,961018327,it was amazing,"The Road was one of the top five audio books I've listened to. The others are Infinite Jest, White Teeth, and The Help, which is not as well written a book as the others- by a long shot- but is a very well produced audio book. I say that I have ""read"" a book when I have listened to it, though I'm not sure it is the same. I often listen to a book twice, especially if it is complicated and densely written. This is because I listen while I am driving and my mind can wander, or be required to pay attention to driving instead of the story. Audio books have another level to them, the reading, that can make a big difference in the enjoyment of the book. Adom has turned me onto listening at an increased speed, which can actually help some books - the ones that are taking too long to finish. But some, like Obama's Dreams of My Father, has to be listened to at 1x speed, because his voice is so recognizable. That was also a book I very much enjoyed listening to. Fun to have the President in my car with me, telling me a story. I think it's great having so many ways to read these days - digital audio, CD's, digital words, and of course the old fashioned BOOK. "
6288,43968027,really liked it,"This was the most depressing thing I have ever read. It literally hurt my heart at times to continue reading. It was so much more tragic not knowing what caused all this. It just didn't matter. All that mattered was their perseverance in what seemed an untenable landscape. Their survival was all that mattered. Some of the things they had to do, I could not have imagined. Some of the things they happened upon, I was sorry I had to witness along with them. I kept thinking, until it was actually spoken by the boy, that I was misunderstanding. My mind just recoiled in disbelief. I would read and then suddenly a light bulb would light and I had to re-read. My mind refused to accept what was on the page.I thought all along there would be some semblance of an ending to their suffering. Help in one form or another. I know some found the ending hopeful. I did not. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Sometimes there is no happy ending."
6288,3461244,it was ok,"What's this, literature? Must be Christmas booty. And indeed it is. I remember reading that Harold Bloom freaking loved McCarthy, and this book is ostensibly science fiction, regarding a father and son making their way across a post-apocalyptic wasteland, so it has to be sort of good right? Not really. What this book is is bleak. Really bleak. Occasionally horrific, always beautifully written, but monotonously, droningly bleak. I didn't go in hoping for Mad Max or something, or even a plot. I just wanted a little more than constant, unending suffering. Maybe some hint at a thought, a message, beyond, ""You can suffer more than you think . . . and canned peaches are actually kinda good."" Ah well, probably well above my head. Last McCarthy for me, thanks."
6288,70435928,really liked it,"I thought this book was beautiful-dark but beautiful. Post apocalypse and beauty are usually mutually exclusive, but a man's love for his son is the one shining beacon in this bleak world. I could sympathize with the need to forge ahead for your child, to protect, to remember, to teach. Normally grammatically incorrect prose bothers me, but it works here. Skeletal scene, skeletal characters, skeletal writing. And in those missing apostrophes and quotation marks and descriptions were the weight of things unsaid in the man's, and the boy's, heart. But I still felt them. In a handful of words, McCarthy vividly captures the essence of the story. In the end, I got a little teary-eyed, but I don't think I was sad as much as touched by the hope, the love, the perseverance of the human spirit. "

6288,764752834,it was amazing,"In Cormac McCarthy's new novel, The Road, the bloodbath is finally complete. The violence that animated his great Western novels has been superseded by a flash of nuclear annihilation, which also blasts away some of what we expect from the reclusive author's work. With this apocalyptic tale, McCarthy has moved into the allegorical realm of Samuel Beckett and José Saramago -- and, weirdly, George Romero.The novel opens on a world that seems to have been demolished by the psychopaths of McCarthy's earlier fiction, as though the Judge from Blood Meridian had graduated from shotguns to atomic bombs and vented his spleen upon the entire planet. It's a shift that transforms not only the physical landscape, reduced now to barren plains of ash, but the moral landscape as well. The fear of dying, so prevalent in McCarthy's previous novels, is balanced here by the fear of surviving: ""Creedless shells of men tottering down the causeways like migrants in a feverland. The frailty of everything revealed at last. Old and troubling issues resolved into nothingness and night.""The Road ( Knopf, 241 pp., $24) follows two of the last people on Earth, an unnamed man and his young son, as they walk through an incinerated wasteland foraging for food and hiding from gangs of starving cannibals. ""The nights now only slightly less black,"" he writes. ""By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp."" This marks a significant departure for McCarthy, but it's hardly a departure for apocalyptic fiction and film, which have trafficked in these dark visions for decades. Of course, McCarthy has borrowed from lowbrow forms before. Most of his works are Faulknerian transformations of dime-store Westerns; his first modern-day novel, last year's No Country for Old Men , wore the worn costumes of a drug-crime police chase.Without its rich voice, The Road would read like a remake of ""Night of the Living Dead."" Indeed, as if to acknowledge that debt, the man remembers his late wife saying, ""We're the walking dead in a horror film."" More than once, the little boy warns his father they shouldn't go into an abandoned house, but then -- no, stop! -- they go in anyway. There are also the requisite touches of gallows humor: the delicious taste of the last Coke on Earth, the only writing that survives worldwide destruction being a billboard that reads: ""See Rock City."" And finally, the one-dimensional horror-flick women: Most middle-school boys have a more nuanced understanding of the opposite sex than McCarthy demonstrates in his fiction, and he does nothing to alter that impression here.But even with its flaws, there's just no getting around it: The Road is a frightening, profound tale that drags us into places we don't want to go, forces us to think about questions we don't want to ask. Readers who sneer at McCarthy's mythic and biblical grandiosity will cringe at the ambition of The Road . At first I kept trying to scoff at it, too, but I was just whistling past the graveyard. Ultimately, my cynicism was overwhelmed by the visceral power of McCarthy's prose and the simple beauty of this hero's love for his son.The novel is made up of several hundred isolated moments, scraps of dialogue and flashes of action. Here's a typical one that could appear anywhere in the book:""The land was gullied and eroded and barren. The bones of dead creatures sprawled in the washes. Middens of anonymous trash. Farmhouses in the fields scoured of their paint and the clapboards spooned and sprung from the wallstuds. All of it shadowless and without feature. The road descended through a jungle of dead kudzu. A marsh where the dead reeds lay over the water. Beyond the edge of the fields the sullen haze hung over the earth and sky alike. By late afternoon it had begun to snow and they went on with the tarp over them and the wet snow hissing on the plastic.""These remarkable passages, like a succession of prose poems, are marked by a few flashes of terror, but we're never forced to gorge on the gore that McCarthy's most devoted fans celebrate. There's only a glimpse of the civilization-ending catastrophe itself, which took place years ago, just before the boy was born: ""A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions."" Afterward this single haunting vision of the early days: ""People sitting on the sidewalk in the dawn half immolate and smoking in their clothes. Like failed sectarian suicides. Others would come to help them. Within a year there were fires on the ridges and deranged chanting. The screams of the murdered. By day the dead impaled on spikes along the road.""These glimpses are metered out carefully in a way that only increases the sense of terror. It's the constant potential for carnage that energizes the story -- the hell that can be spotted in the flash of lightning, a baby on a spit roasting over an open fire.Among his thinly plotted novels, The Road is McCarthy's most thinly plotted of all, as there's literally nowhere to go, no sense in going, just the inexorable impulse to move. The plot, such as it is, comes down to this father's existential need to keep his son alive and hopeful in a world that offers no life or hope. Day after day, month after month, they're starving and freezing, pushing along a cart with the few provisions they scavenge from decrepit homes looted bare years ago. ""The boy was all that stood between him and death,"" McCarthy writes. ""He saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe.""But against that lifeless state, the man clings to a raw faith in his mission: ""My job is to take care of you,"" he tells his son. ""I was appointed to do that by God. I will kill anyone who touches you."" With everything scraped away, the impulse to sanctify, to worship, to create meaning remains. ""All of this like some ancient anointing,"" the man thinks after washing his son's hair in an icy dead lake. ""So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you've nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.""Concurrent with keeping his son alive is the more metaphysical challenge of sustaining his son's innate goodness while forcing him to witness the corruption of all moral behavior. ""Are we still the good guys?"" the boy asks in moments of confusion and shock. His father insists they are. ""This is what good guys do,"" he tells him. ""They keep trying. They dont give up."" Why, then, his son asks, won't he help the stragglers they run across instead of running from them or shooting at them? ""We should go to him, Papa. We could get him and take him with us. . . . I'd give that little boy half of my food."" How to explain the necessity of abandoning others to certain death (or worse, in one particularly terrifying scene) while maintaining that they're ""the good guys,"" the ones ""carrying the fire""?Under these singularly bleak conditions, the boy's nature -- his impulse to help, his anxiety about stealing others' food -- is, of course, naive. But even when fighting for their lives, his father knows that it's a naiveté inspired by the boy's goodness that makes their fight worthwhile, that allows him to resist the age-old temptation ""to curse God and die.""The encounter that illumines the final moments of the novel will infuriate McCarthy die-hards who relish his existential bleakness, but the scene confirms earlier allusions that suggest the roots of this end-of-the-world story reach far past the nuclear age to the apocalypse of Christian faith. The book's climax -- an immaculate conception of Pilgrim's Progress and ""Mad Max"" -- is a startling shift for McCarthy, but a tender answer to a desperate prayer.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/..."

O que quer que escreva nunca lhe fará justiça e parecer-me-á sempre redutor ou demasiado cliché. Mas cá vai.Num cenário pós-apocalíptico, onde reinam as cinzas e a desesperança e onde dificilmente se consegue vislumbrar qualquer em sentido em estar vivo, 
The Road
 (
A Estrada
) é uma história de amor e abnegação, de tenacidade e superação, que nos é contada sob a forma de uma viagem. Uma viagem geográfica na esperança incerta de uma salvação, mas sobretudo uma viagem pelos espaços mais recônditos da consciência humana: o que conseguimos fazer e o que conseguimos recusar-nos a fazer quando confrontados com situações limite, capazes de fazer sucumbir os mais elementares padrões de moralidade e humanidade. Uma viagem que, mais do que uma “fuga para a frente”, é uma jornada ao longo da qual nos deparamos com o que de mais grandioso e de mais abjecto o ser humano é capaz. 

[Imagens do filme The Road (2009) de John Hillcoat]É um livro curto e minimalista, despojado de elementos secundários e de linguagem retórica. Duas personagens, desapossadas de quase tudo, até dos próprios nomes: o “rapaz” e o “homem” a quem o rapaz chama pai. Os diálogos são geralmente constituídos por falas muito curtas e focam-se frequentemente no conflito entre as práticas exigidas à sobrevivência e a manutenção das referências morais básicas. O rapaz rege-se ainda pelo exercício da bondade, no que é contrariado pelo homem, que acredita que esse sentimento não pode ter lugar na realidade implacável em que tentam sobreviver. Há também uma pistola com duas balas, a última das quais o homem reserva para o rapaz, caso as circunstâncias determinem que essa seja a melhor opção. E como conciliar tudo isto com a necessidade de fazer com que a criança, a última ou uma das últimas numa terra moribunda, mantenha acesa dentro de si a chama da esperança (no livro metaforizada na forma de uma espécie de fogo sagrado)?
