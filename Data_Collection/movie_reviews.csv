tt0090576,1,"Movie based on the famous novel by Harry Mulisch, who also wrote the Discovery of Heaven. In the center is Anton Steenwijk (Derek de Lint), who sees his parents shot and his house burnt after a shooting that killed a collaborator of the German Nazi's in World War II. All his life, Anton is curious about what really happened that night, but when he finds out, will that truly satisfy him?

Interesting story, well played and directed by Rademakers (director of 'Als twee druppels water' and 'Max Havelaar'), which won the 'Best foreign language' Oscar back in 1987. And although some viewers won't like the 'coincidental' ending, it's probably one of the best pictures ever to have come from this country... 7/10."
tt0090576,2,"This film is based on the Harry Mulisch novel, and both have some distinguishing characteristics that go back - on purpose - to classic Greek tragedy theatre. The incredible co-incidence that carries the story is reminiscent of ancient literary 'vehicles' that carry a story. Thus, you should not look at the chance events as being part of the story, but as being the foundation for the story - they, in themselves, should not really be questioned.

Also, note that every chance meeting is preceded by a meeting with some kind of stone. The Dutch word for dice is 'dobbelsteen', or dicing-stone, so that the simile of dice and chance can be extended to stones and chance. This explains the significance of Anton meeting his first wife while visiting the Stone of Scones.

The book, more strongly than the film, is also constructed as a Greek tragedy, with a prologue, five acts and then an epilogue.

Anton Steenwijk is also interesting himself: he represses the events of the assault, but it keeps coming back at him. But he is an anaesthetist in more than one way - he puts his memories to sleep. Even in the final stages, when the story is already quite clear to him, he uses drugs at his house in Tuscany and seeks to ease a toothache in Amsterdam before going to the Ban the Bomb demonstration.

Personally, I think the book was translated into a film in brilliant fashion. My major qualm with it is the mediocrity of the sound and sound effects. Some pretty good acting and a fantastic storyline make this one well worth the watch."
tt0090576,3,I have seen this movies so many times that the subtitling has become irrelevant. Smarty movie with worldwide appeal. A growing up MD is subconciously living a life that has been dramatically changed by an incident during the WWII. such powerful characters. I walk out the movuie stunned at the way the movie works for me. go and see it for yourself
tt0090576,4,
tt0090576,5,"What is really fascinating in this Dutch movie is the way the past takes shape again,little by little,on a very long period:the hero is a middle-age man when he finally learns the final truth .What is less convincing in the implausibility of these situations and the main flaw of the work :each time a new character appears,outside of course of the two wives,his only purpose is to provide the hero with new facts about the tragedy he went through when he was 12.

And however the story is absorbing:the first scenes ,during the fateful night are harrowing,first in the parents 'house or in the icy landscape that surrounds it or in the dungeon where the young boy meets the female Resistance fighter.

Then begins the child's adult life and while there are very strong scenes ,there are also some flaws: too much voice-over (""He spends his Easter holiday in London"" ""He gets married"" are completely pointless:the picture is enough),and it's really difficult to follow the hero's psychological change (why for instance does he get divorce?) But its questionings (who are the heroes ? who are the traitors?) sometimes recalls Jorge Luis Borges.One of the best scenes shows Anton talking with the collaborator's son:who is the victim NOW? did this young man and his mother deserve what happened to them?""They 're living"" replies Anton.

And is Anton's attitude -stay away from the events that shakes the world- so worthwhile?That's why the last scene is very revealing:finally he understood that responsibility is everywhere and should be shared by everyone.

In spite of its flaws,it's certainly one of the most interesting European movies of the eighties."
tt0090576,6,"""The Assault"", more than any other movie, shows that the Netherlands may have Europe's best output in terms of movies. In January, 1945, the Nazis are still occupying the Netherlands. One night, a Nazi guard is shot while on patrol. Immediately, the people in the house next to which he falls move him in front of the next house, where protagonist Anton Steenwijk lives. The Nazis kill Anton's parents and brother, and take Anton prisoner. In jail, he meets a woman, but can only see her mouth. She comforts him for a few minutes before they take her away.

After the war ends, Anton spends the rest of his life trying to come to terms with what happened that night, and every woman with whom he hooks up has the same sort of mouth as the woman in the jail cell. Then, at the end of the movie, while at an anti-nuclear march in Paris, he learns the full story of what happened that night.

""The Assault"" is a movie that will truly blow you away. It will shake you, but it's also about hope. You have to see it to understand how great it is. I recommend it to everyone."
tt0090576,7,"The Dutch are not great at making movies but when they make a WW II movie it often is a little masterpiece. ""De Aanslag"" is a movie like this.

""De Aanslag"" isn't necessarily about WW II but more about the effects of it on a persons life and why things happen the way they do and how little things can effect a persons life for ever. Most of the movie's story is set in the years after WW II and uses flashbacks of things that happened in WW II to make more things clear and to show things from a different perspective from different individuals that were involved in the incident were the movie is about. It becomes more and more clear what happened at the night that collaborator Ploeg was killed but the Dutch resistance and more importantly why things happened the way it happened. The story also shows a detailed view of the Netherlands and their citizens the years and decades after WW II and how it still affected many.

There are many great returning characters in the story and the acting is for especially Dutch standards pretty high. Derek de Lint who now is better know world wide for his role as Derek Rayne in ""Poltergeist: The Legacy"" is a great leading man that really carries the movie.

The cinematography from Theo van de Sande who later did the cinematography for the movie hit ""Blade"" is great and sets a nice mood. The directing by Fons Rademakers is done wonderfully and it never makes the movie hard to follow even though at times it gets a bit complicated.

Great Dutch Oscar winning drama with some memorable moments and a fantastic ending were everything comes together and gets clear.

tt0090576,8,"My family is from Haarlem and I feel very close to the places, scenes, characters and the atmosphere that the movie generates. The fact that there are only a view productions regarding the Dutch resistance is very sad to me as the Dutch resistance was on of the best organized during the German occupation. However the man that was shot dead outside Anton Steenwijk's house was an NSB participant. He belonged to the Dutch Nazi Party. As previously stated, by some people in this thread, he was not a German Nazi but a Dutch collaborator. A lot of my family were in the resistance during the Nazi occupation. Some of them were shut by the Germans, in the dunes near Bloemendaal a/Zee, the site of the ""Ere Begraaf Plaats"" where Anton takes his daughter to find Truus Koster's grave, in the latter end of the movie. When I was young we often spend time there, to visit friends and family that were executed during those troublesome years. I dearly love this movie and would recommend it to anyone."
tt0090576,9,"I found this movie to be very thought-provoking, particularly its insights into the experiences of the residents of Holland during the Nazi occupation.

One drawback in this movie was the totally incongruous chance meetings that Anton has with key individuals. e.g.: Ploeg's son just happens to be shoved into Anton's doorway during an anti-communist riot, Anton, while in a crowded cafe, just happens to be sitting right next to the man who shot Ploeg, and finally, in an anti-nuclear demonstration in which hundreds of people are marching, he just happens to be walking abreast of his long-ago next door neighbor!"
tt0090576,10,"In January 1945, during the second world war, the Dutch resistance kills a collaborator in the street where the 12 year old Anton Steenwijk lives. The man was shot in front of his neighbors house, but is moved by them to the house of the family Steenwijk. Because of this, his father, mother and brother are killed by the Germans, and their house is set to fire. During his life, Anton meets several people that tell him more about what really happened on the night of the assault.

What really makes this a great film is how it covers so much of the 20th century, at least the major war events. Vietnam, Stalin, Hungary and more... this is not just a story about the Netherlands in World War II, but really a larger tale of Europe. The balance between the personal and the international is what makes it such a notable film."
tt0090576,11,"'De Aanslag' is an epic drama taking place in the final days of German occupation of the Netherlands in 1945.

A Nazi collaborator, Ploeg, was shot dead in Haarlem, and the corpse dragged to the front of a neighbouring house. When the Nazis arrived they assumed that the people in that house were responsible, arrested the occupants and set the house alight. Several other people were also rounded up and all executed. The exception is Anton, the 12 year old son of the family who lived in the house, who was taken to the military HQ and later sent to his uncle in Amsterdam.

These traumatic events had a serious psychological impact on Anton, particularly in his later life. Like a slow puzzle, the pieces began fitting together. As an adult Anton discovered who killed the collaborator, and who dragged the body to the front of their house, events that had such devastating effects.

It is an excellent film, but in my view a little too long. It loses momentum halfway through, but fortunately picks up again towards the end. Acting, cinematography and music score are top-notch. It brings a powerful anti-war message, and also explores the power of public mass protest to change the social order. I still score it a very good 8/10."
tt0090576,12,"The film and the book, are really very much the same here. I read the book first and then watched the film and I have really not much to say about both. They are both of the same quality, for both book and film feature the same amount of accidental meetings which are after a while quite unbelievable and that is all the criticism I have. The film has of course certain things which are better than the book, for instance it is more exciting, but then again the film also has it's downsides, for sometimes the acting is not that great. But overall the better and worse things level each other out so my verdicts for book and film are the same: pretty good.

If you like Mulisch's books and are interested in World War 2 read De Zaak 40/61.

7 out of 10"
tt0090576,13,I saw this movie in school for an asignment and I was suprised by the fact that this was a Dutch movie. This is one of those movies wich can stand the test of time. A involving story is told about Anton Steenwijk who we will follow through out this film. A must see film that tells the story of a typical dutch family in war time.
tt0276751,0,"I think I smiled all the way through `About a Boy,' a comic near-masterpiece derived from the best-selling novel by Nick Hornby. For the sake of accuracy, both the novel and the film should more rightly be titled `About TWO Boys,' since the story focuses not only on 12-year old Marcus, but on 38-year old Will, a man totally dedicated to the proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island, thank you very much. Will's `island' is his own London flat, which he has equipped with all the accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology  in the form of computers, big screen TV's and DVD players - can afford. Who needs people when you have so much `stuff' to keep you content and occupied? Will thrives in his environment, much to the chagrin of his married couple friends who keep insisting that he must certainly be miserable without a wife and family to give his life meaning. But Will loves being shallow  a fact of his personality he is more than willing to declare right up front  and the last thing he needs  or thinks he needs  is people to clutter it up. Yet, island dwellers have a tendency not to remain marooned for long, and, before he knows it, Will finds himself striking up a relationship with a lonely, backward boy named Marcus, whose mother suffers from serious bouts of suicidal depression.

More than any comedy in recent memory, `About a Boy' establishes a tone and sticks with it to the end. The screenplay by Peter Hedges, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz (the latter two function as the film's directors as well) manages to take a potentially clichéd and predictable story and invest it with a warmth, wit and tenderness that are all-enveloping. The voice-over narration by both Will and Marcus, which introduces us to their characters and keeps us informed as to their mental progress throughout the film, is remarkably clever and droll. Yet, the characters never come across as smug, smart-alecky or flippant. Rather, they speak and behave in ways that are both believable and realistic. Hugh Grant gives his richest performance to date as Will, the man who refuses to grow up and assume the role of responsible adult, blithely unaware of the emotional depths that lie hidden under a surface of apathy and indifference. The superb Grant is more than matched by relative newcomer Nicholas Hoult, an extraordinarily gifted young actor who doesn't look like the average `adorable' screen kid, and who makes Marcus into a very real, very likable and very sensitive young man. The remainder of the large cast is outstanding as well. Moreover, the film is very astute in its observation about just how easy technology has made it for us to isolate ourselves from one another. Admittedly, a little of the sharpness does go out of the screenplay in its closing stretches, but not enough to diminish one's pleasure appreciably.

In many ways, `About a Boy' is a movie that needs to be experienced first hand, since mere words fail to convey the very special charm and spell it manages to cast over the viewer. Rush to see it. Comic gems like this one don't come around very often!"
tt0276751,1,"Being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards, perhaps, but it can also be the definitive test of one's character. If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends, or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment, it says something about who that person is. On the other hand, if one squanders the opportunity on a totally self-absorbed, shallow existence, it says even more. And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments, it's a cosmetically created, external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life, and sooner or later-- to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence-- that bubble is bound to burst; and when it finally happens, when the wake-up call comes, how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character, which is what happens to a such a man in `About A Boy,' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, and starring Hugh Grant.

As far as Will Freeman (Grant) is concerned, he has the perfect life; he lives comfortably, if not extravagantly, on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance. On the surface, at least, he's happy. Admittedly, however, he's the very epitome of `shallow,' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships, or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all. He merely takes from life, gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it. But of late, his relationships have become a bit `sticky.' Women are becoming too demanding, the break-ups too messy. He needs a new conquest, a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew, with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return.

Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for; fortuitous, however, in a way he doesn't realize, as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life, as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective. For the first time, Will begins to question who he is, and what he's doing-- or not doing-- with his life.

Telling this story (adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, from the novel by Nick Hornby) presented a challenge to the filmmakers, in that it's nothing really new; the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies, many along the same lines as this one (recently, `The Kid,' with Bruce Willis, for example). So a fresh approach and presentation, including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors, was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever. Which it does, and splendidly. And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts. The screenplay is intelligent, and the characters-- especially Will and Marcus' mom, Fiona (Toni Collette)-- are convincingly well developed. With Will, there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film; it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is, after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow. The same is true of Fiona. There's detours and set-backs which-- as in real life-- prevent a direct journey from point A to point B, and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way. Weitz and Weitz set a good pace, and most importantly, manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic, maudlin sentimentality. Rather, the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable, and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.

As Will, Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever. In some respects, Will is similar to other characters Grant has created (most notably Daniel in `Bridget Jones's Diary'), but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve, and without question this is his most three-dimensional, fully developed character yet. Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence, but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here. He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms, and by the end, it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before; with this role, he has effectively expanded his range as an actor. In the final analysis, it's a performance with real substance, and it makes Will a truly memorable character.

The young Hoult brings Marcus convincingly to life, as well, with an extremely natural performance, in which he commendably manages to avoid the trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen. Some credit must go to his directors, of course, but it's Hoult who makes it especially believable in the way he responds, for instance, to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen (his rather introspective response to the taunts of his school mates, for example; quite different than what is usually portrayed in film). And in their scenes together, Grant and Hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures the overall success of this film.

The supporting cast includes Rachel Weisz (Rachel), Isabel Brook (Angie), Sharon Small (Christine), Victoria Smurfit (Suzie) and Nat Gastiain Tena (Ellie). Entertaining, as well as insightful, `About A Boy' gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of the human condition that has been explored before, but rarely as effectively. The Weitz Brothers make the subject of their film accessible to a wide audience, and in a way that is engaging and satisfying. This film is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it, in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect. And that's the magic of the movies. 9/10."
tt0276751,2,"In the wonderfully entertaining ""About A Boy,"" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.

This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's ""full,"" but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on ""web-based research"" (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), ""exercise"" (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerismsGrant's specialty, I thinkare v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz  are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.

The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. ""It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic."" The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow.

The strength of ""About a Boy"" is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make ""About A Boy"" one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 10/10."
tt0276751,3,"Sometimes a rut can feel like a hammock when we get stuck in one.

""About A Boy"" is about a Londoner who was apparently born into one, imprisoned as it were by his father's legacy as author of one of the world's most popular and annoying Christmas songs. After years of feckless unemployed upper-middle-class living, Will views himself as an island, and sees his lack of long-term relationships as a plus. Even offered the simple honor of being an infant's godfather, Will begs off, saying he'd be ""crap"" at it and probably just ""try and shag"" the girl the moment she turned 18.

""I always thought you had hidden depths,"" the mother says.

""No, you've always had that wrong,"" Will cheerfully replies. ""I really am this shallow.""

But of course Will does have depths, and as played by Hugh Grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previously-unguessed-at depths of his own, we find ourselves rooting for Will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12-year-old named Marcus, played with welcome non-cuteness by Nicholas Hoult. Marcus, an abuse magnet at school, is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal. Will, a 12-year-old at heart, is a perfect if unknowing candidate.

Based on the great Nick Hornby novel, ""About A Boy"" walks a fine line, doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. Like Hornby's book, the movie depicts Will's perverse detachment from the world as both delightful and pathetic. Life is a full plate of pain for those who participate, but the benefits, as Marcus tries to tell Will, beat all else.

Of course, most of us don't have the luxury for ""island living,"" and the potential of resenting Will, especially as played by that handsome devil Grant, might have been the film's biggest danger. But Grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on the smugness and draws on the lost boy within.

For example, when Will tries to infiltrate a single-mothers' club as a way of bagging some commitment-free sex, we watch him tell the mothers about his own non-existent two-year-old boy Ned telling him ""you hang in there, Dad,"" then reacting with uncertain fear when the mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child.

But we also see the pain Will pretends isn't there, in brief flashes as he reflects on the hard-drinking failure his father became after his one-hit wonder, and especially in one great scene where Will finds himself with a woman he really cares about, unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment. During that scene, and a later, angry one with Marcus, Grant's acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy.

The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz of ""American Pie""-fame, prove they can make a film that delivers intelligence as well as laughter, and with writer Peter Hedges, fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with Hornby's solid story. I especially liked the one near the end of the movie, but if I revealed anything I'd probably get some Flack for it, so say no more.

The very last scene of the movie is a mistake, though, the kind of tidy resolution Hornby's novel and life itself rightly rejects. It's the one bum note in this film, but enough of one to dock it a point with me. Otherwise, I'd have to rate this above even the other cinematic Hornby adaptation, the classic ""High Fidelity."" But this is a very entertaining film, with great set design, a terrific ""Rubber Soul""-style Britpop title song by Badly Drawn Boy, tight editing, and subtle, crafty camera work. Also some great supporting performances, especially Toni Collette as Marcus' mother, who has the film's toughest role (she must be funny and suicidal) and manages to not only pull it off but gives ""About A Boy"" a wonderfully unstable center. As ""About A Boy"" makes clear, instability is a good thing when it shakes us from our ruts."
tt0276751,4,"This movie really came as a surprise to me. I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought ""American Pie"" was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature, someone clever. This movie, however, turned out to be all that: mature, clever, witty, sensible, honest and, most of all, really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all, I still liked ""High Fidelity"" a tiny bit better (the movie, not the book), but ""About A Boy"" comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this book/movie as I am, get the DVD. There are wonderful deleted scenes on it, which are as funny as the rest of the movie."
tt0276751,5,"`About a Boy' was being touted as a great make over for Hugh Grant and it is. Gone is his infamous bumbling English fop role, his fluffy hair lost to a sharp, more stylish cut. Here he plays a rich selfish layabout, Will, who cruises through life on the royalties from a song his deceased father penned years ago. He finds a great way to meet women who don't want to get involved through a single mother's group  which is where he meets the strange twelve year old boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who lives with his depressed, suicidal mother Fiona (Toni Collette). A tragic event sees Marcus seeking comfort with the indifferent Will who begins to realise that there's more to life than sitting around at home all day.

Hugh Grant is on peak form here  he sheds his old roles for that of a fresher, younger man. He is able to convey charm and selfishness not just through words, but also through his mannerisms. He even conveys genuine affable warmth later on in the movie, without making my teeth grate Equally impressive is Toni Collette as Marcus' sad mother. Her character has a tragic feeling to it, a real sense of world-weariness conveyed in a great combination of makeup and acting. The real star of the movie  for me- is Nicholas Hoult as the young boy who helps Will come to realizations about his life. He doesn't get by on cute good looks, like far too many kid actors, because he can actually act  from the innocence of a child (when he tries to get his mother and Will together), to the simplistic musings of children who can't understand why some people hurt (such as his mother). Like Osment (whom he amusing compares himself to), Hoult shows that child actors are just as, if not more so, capable as their elders.

The script of the movie is witty, without being outright hilarious. It's what you come to expect of the British comedy market (the weak `Ali G indahouse' aside). It being a British comedy you can predict where it's going to go and there are relatively few surprises along the way. Having said that the characters are sketched strongly enough, and the humour at a high enough level, that you'll be more than entertained along the way.

It's surprising to see that this movie was directed by the `American Pie' Weitz brothers, because they bring a thoughtful, contemplative air to the movie, while never getting bogged down in pointless camera techniques  the most we're left with is some simple screen wipes. They've also chosen well by having Badly Drawn Boy compose the whole soundtrack as it works very well with the film's tone.

There's nothing outstanding in `About a Boy' but what's here is done surprisingly well. It's a nice movie that's quite enjoyable for relaxing to some evening. A 7/10 seems just."
tt0276751,6,"I was a bit scared about what kind of treatment Chris and Paul Weitz had given the great novel by Nick Hornby. I have to report they did a great job in bringing it to the screen with the help of the screenwriter, Peter Hedges III. It's amazing what they have accomplished in translating the book to the screen and not lose focus in doing so. A great many Hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this film.

Hugh Grant strikes the right amount of hipness, confusion and complete lack of responsibility in his interpretation of Will. He is an actor that brings the right attitude in playing a man about London looking for women, no matter where. He's a prowler looking for women who will fall prey to his charms. Mr. Grant is just perfect for this role.

The biggest surprise though, was the amazing debut of Nicholas Hoult, who just bowled us over as Marcus, the ""boy"" of the title. This young actor has a great career ahead of him if the people behind him will steer him into the right vehicles because he is a natural. He gives Mr. Grant a run for his money. The chemistry of their time together on screen is basically what was on the book while we were reading it.

Toni Collette plays another mother. Again, her interpretation of Fiona was on target. Rachel Weisz adds beauty to the film as Rachel. Someone should take a good look at this gorgeous woman and perhaps give her and Hugh Grant another vehicle where they can shine once again."
tt0276751,7,"I just watched this yesterday again :)

i was at my grandmothers and we all watched my DVD it 3 generations of us all watched it

all loved it from my little cousin 10 - my grandparents 70s With a steady stream of laughs, masterful & quite original plot line and includes a very intriguing character ensemble.

This movie follows the tradition of Hugh Grant playing the villain extremely well inkeeping with his debut in Bridget Jones' Diary as a villainous character.

I personally liked this slightly better then Bridget it was a little more suspenseful and serious, but all lovers of the Bridget jones' series should go an buy this. guaranteed enjoyment.

but about a boy is timeless, if you enjoy it the second time you will enjoy it forever. I mention second time as the humor is a fairly conservative and educated so you need to pay attention. Or you will definitely miss the hilarity of Hugh Grants character as it isn't directly implied like skit comedies such as Road Trip and Old School. which are boring after 2 views.

don't leave the store with a copy or two of this.

rating 8.2/10

*Arghhh I've wounded his soul:'( **ohhh SHUT UP your wounding my soul!!"
tt0276751,8,"Described by some as a man's version of Bridget Jones Diary the remarkable thing is that it lives up to the description. Hugh Grant, with an excellent script that could have been written especially for him, plays a young confirmed single yuppie socialite, dividing his day into units in which to pack his meaningless but carefree, philandering lifestyle and disposable income. After initially discovering unmarried mothers as a new supply of grateful sexual objects, he becomes drawn into a meaningful life after making friends with a young boy. Avoiding a cheesy ending is one of the film's many triumphs."
tt0276751,9,"Selfish, self-centered rich `kid' Will Freeman lives alone as an island in London, living off royalties from his father's record. When a new dating trick sees him targeting single mothers because they are easier to dump he unwittingly gets mixed up with Marcus. Marcus is a 12 year old who is bullied at school because of his hippy life style (forced on him by his mother) and struggles at home with his depressed, suicidal mother. At first he sees himself helping his mum by getting Will to like her but gradually Marcus and Will get used to each other and have lessons that both can learn.

Following the steaming success of High Fidelity, another Hornby book makes the transition. However credit should be given for setting the movie in England and not moving it somewhere else (cooler). This however is probably due to the lead being English and very bankable!

The story is of course about blokes.and blokes problems  this is Hornby after all. The plot is simple but the fact that it done with a great deal of wit makes it come across very easily. Occasionally the mix of heavy subjects (Marcus's home life) with the comedy of Will's life is a little uneasy, but after a while it mixes better. The story is pretty revealing  I can see a lot of myself in Will, as many men will, and it is involving then to see Marcus teach him things about life. However, saying that, the best thing about this is the comedy  when Will is involved it is nearly always laugh out loud funny  and that's most of the time.

The directors deal with this film really well  they focus on Grants strengths and also use several really cool visual things to add to the comedy  like quick cuts and freeze frame  but not to the point of annoyance. Surprising that these guys did American Pie! Not the most subtle or clever of comedies

Grant is excellent here  he easily handles the emotional side of the film and the comedy, but it's in the comedy he excels. His face plays out as many jokes as his words and he is indeed a master at playing this character. However here he has to work harder than when he does his usual `English-fop' stuff, because Will is selfish and not immediately likeable..I must admit that at the start I struggled to get into the film because I hate these people who spend their time in Notting Hill cafes living off inheritances etc  so it's a credit to Grant that he carries it off. Hoult is not as good  he has too much weight to carry. Hoult has to manage the whole emotional side of the film and at times he can't convince. Collette is good as Fiona but again suffers from not having any of the comedy side of the film. Rachel Weisz was good in a small role but as far as I'm concerned  if she was making this, then she wasn't making another rubbish Mummy film!

Overall this is a successful adaptation of the book. The emotional side and the comedy at times don't sit well together and at times it all feels very lightweight, but ultimately it all comes together. Grant is excellent and excels himself here  when he's on screen the film is hilarious and moves fluidly. Unfortunately it slightly highlights the weaknesses of those around him."

tt0276751,11,"About a Boy is a heart-warming comedy film starring Hugh Grant and introducing Nicholas Hoult.

The film tells a tale of the unlikely connection between a 30something man who's got it all, without ever having done a hard days work in his life, and thinks of himself as an 'island' and a peculiar 12 year old boy who struggles at the mercy of bullies and his depressed mother. Whilst this may seem like an unlikely duo, Grant and Hoult manage to pull it off perfectly.

The film is well scripted, making sure that it delivers comedy and seriousness at a good level without one over-balancing the other and without ruining the book written by Nick Hornby of which this film was based off of.

As well as top performances from Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, the film also contains excellent music performed by Badly Drawn Boy. The music used in the film further enhances the scenes and emotions that are being conveyed.

The main message in the film, is to further prove a famous quote from Jon Bon Jovi stating that ""No man is an island."". We learn from watching the characters themselves, especially Will, how true this quote is and the importance of having others in your life.

I've seen this film countless times and each and every time I find that I'm smiling at the end. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly one of Hugh Grant's best performance and provides a heart-warming message."
tt0276751,12,
tt0276751,13,"The Weitz brothers (of 'American Pie' fame) surprised me with this intelligent comedy. They do a commendable job of bringing Nick Hornby's modern British comedy to screen. Peter Hedges takes up the challenge to adapt Hornby's novel and he does a fine job. I liked that it wasn't Americanized. The quirkiness and humour is well balanced, witty and clever while amusing. The film is mainly about growth of the characters especially Will, Fiona and Marcus and I loved how it was portrayed in a gradually subtle way. The situations are easy to relate to. Even though the characters live under unusual circumstances: like Will choosing not to work because he does not need to, the suicidal Fiona or Marcus regularly visiting Will in order to fix him up with his mom, they are easy to identify with. Hugh Grant is great as the shallow Will. He's cast against type and this is perhaps the role that allows him to stretch his acting further. Nicholas Hoult delivers a natural performance. He's certainly not those movie kids who are made to look cute because the director can't get them to act (so credit does go to the Weitzs). Toni Collette is superb as always. Rachel Weisz makes the best of a small role. The rest of the cast do a good enough job. The soundtrack is gentle and whimsical at times, flowing smoothly with the steady pace. I liked the songs of Badly Drawn Boy. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD are worth a watch. In a nutshell, 'About A Boy' is a simple, delightful and funny movie about growing up."
tt0276751,14,"This adaptation by Brothers Weitz of the Nick Horny novel of the same name is a very refreshing comedy-drama that successfully uses a double voice-over narration, one of a man who hasn't quite grown up (Grant) and the other of a boy who has to grow up too quickly (Hoult). Toni Collette received several nominations for her supporting role, but the substance of her character is not quite apparent; while Rachel Weisz's subplot comes together and undone a little too easily. If this film were set during 1993–1994 like it was in the book, the overall story would have had more significance. Still, while a little too modern for its own good, ABOUT A BOY is undeniably entertaining (and even, ugh, a little cute) and without a doubt worth remembering.

*** (out of four)"
tt0276751,15,"About a Boy is a charming Comedy (and a little romance) which shows a sweet story played out excellently. With some great acting from the best when it comes to this type of movie and also many great contributing factors, this is one big film which really is excellent. The script is tight, direction superb and even the setting is good too make this, in my opinion a just about great film and one that even has room to grow.

The story is one that can touch the heart yet also find your funny bone and by the end you should feel well very pleasant. It is well timed all the way through and when the romantic areas are explored it holds it's ground making this better than the majority of Romcoms out there. I felt it could have been maybe slightly more laugh out loud but in any case it makes you giggle.

Hugh Grant is excellent in the lead role and his relationship with Nicholas Holt is one to be savoured for the future generation of film lovers. Going on to Holt well his talent is plainly seen, not the best actor here but his work with Grant makes both of them shine so much that awards could have been won big time. People like Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz pitch in perfectly and they don't go understated when your done here.

Many say this is one film which eclipses it's novel that it's based on and you can see why with such a strong script adapted beautifully and given so much rich depth that you finish the movie feeling you've seen the best of British cinema. I think Chris and Paul Weitz do a good job in directing and are part of the reason why Grant and Holt work so well, the two seem to be able to mould them to each other and get the best out of them.

I think the main negativity comes from well very little, yes it lacks substantial comedy but then again, when are many films like this crying with laughter affairs. I felt Nicholas Holt can be poor(yes I know he's a child actor), I just felt he can seem to much like he is being directed and not portraying his true quality as an actor, but other than that very little is wrong with the film.

If you like good old romps and a fun old adventure then this is for you as it really spans over a good year to show you truly everything about each main characters life. If your looking to be heart wrenched well I don't think it will make you cry but no doubt it has it's sadder moment but in any case, tissues should not be needed whilst viewing.

Overall I think it was Just About an excellent comedy and one that will be remembered for a long time. The chemistry of the leads is truly the stand out point from this movie and without not just the characters but the two actors, this would have been greatly at a disadvantage. Love it or hate it and it be slightly soppy, this movie is sure to have some feeling warm and fuzzy but I accept some others will feel slightly more not annoyed but maybe cheesy seeing as the majority of this movie is very one liner orientated, but they all come out well."
tt0276751,16,"About a Boy is a 2002 comedy-drama film co-written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. It is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. The film stars Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, and Rachel Weisz. The film at times uses double voice-over narration, when the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts. Will is a 36-year-old underachiever with a fear of commitment that leads him to seek out relationships with single mothers, on the assumption that they are more desperate. However, plans go awry when he befriends with Marcus, the weird 12-year-old son of his latest target. Soon, Will and Marcus become friends, and as Will teaches Marcus how to be a cool kid, Marcus helps Will finally to grow up."
tt0276751,17,"just finished watching this fine fine movie and am still trying to digest it. well...i must say this coming of age ( Hugh's character too )movie made me feel so content after i finished viewing it. i've forgotten how good Hugh grant is in melodramatic comedies and all in all i think the British are the best at these types of comedies. the movie has a decent rating of 7.1 and i would personally give it a 7.5. this is possibly one of Hugh's best efforts and he seemed to have a lot of fun doing it.

as an American i can't understand how our shallow idiotic unintelligent comedies fare so much better then a gem like this. i guess most audiences were like the ones in the school audience during the music talent show. Marcus did the song "" killing me softly "" because it was one of his mums favorites and even though the audience was banal and cruel he still had the gumption and heart to get up there an perform for his mom. life isn't about trying to fit in and be with the cool crowd, there's so much more important things in life then that and Marcus was mature enough to understand that, with help from Will of course.

well, i won't give anything else away about this movie, but if you're looking for a intelligent, heartwarming, tender, sad and funny movie, this is it. i would recommend this movie to just about anybody over the age of 10. this is one of those hidden little gems that has also a very strong positive message about what is right and what is wrong. there was not one dull moment in this movie and i think i must've chuckle or guffawed about 50 times during the duration of this movie and it's not a long movie.

if you like intelligent tender heartwarming comedic movies where all the actors and actresses were in top form...then you have to watch this movie. one of my favorite comedies all-time."
tt0276751,18,"Early on in 'About a boy' the opinion is ventured that `no man is an island'. At the same stage I was wondering when `romantic comedy' became a euphemism for 'inoffensive date movie'. The film shed little light on the facts behind either theory, but succeeded in proving them both as true and unchangeable as rush hour traffic.

The story follows Will, a fashionable layabout with no cares in the world, and Marcus, a 12-year old boy with a manically depressed hippy for a mother whose school life makes a working week in a sweatshop seem attractive. The unlikely pair end up together when Will's plan to date single mothers for some hassle free relationships backfires in the most ironic way possible.

We are then treated to the usual selection of writer Nick Hornby's pop culture observations and comic characterisations of nerdy males having to contend with the concept of a serious relationship and real life. Whilst the electric prose of his debut 'Fever Pitch' has faded through his later works Hornby still has the power to leave a readers jaw hanging in the breeze by having his generally likeable protagonists commit truly nasty acts. It is this risk taking and realism that gives his writing an edge. Unfortunately the film adaptations of his books merely see him as the new Cameron Crowe, and 'About A Boy' offers a double jackpot with the smart arse kiddie factor that was so successful in Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous.

It is depressingly predictable that the casting tells you everything you need to know about the film. Hugh Grant can make a mass murderer seem like an amusingly misunderstood guy, so his portrayal of Will seems charming to the point of sainthood, whilst Rachel Weitz may as well have 'attractive love interest' stapled to her forehead the way the make-up and lighting departments have obviously fawned over her. Grant's spiky hair cut and characterisations can't stop the audience warming to him, where someone like Richard E Grant could have given the character real sleaze, anger and most of all depth.

Such safe playing production touches smother the original touches of the film. The homespun soundtrack, completely composed by Badly Drawn Boy, is cut so slickly into the film it starts sounding like a selection from Time Life music 'acoustic love moods' CD. This wrecks the rare pleasure of having a maverick songwriter given creative control over a movies entire soundscape (at Hornby's request no less). Toni Collete's gutsy performance as Marcus' mother is edited down to little more than a hippy-chic cameo of her Muriel's Wedding persona and idiosyncratic touches such as man and boy bonding over Countdown are poorly handled.

If this wasn't enough to send the viewers higher brain functions to sleep we are given not one but two voiceovers in the film to make sure every nuance of every performance is clearly explained with no hint of ambiguity, thereby killing off any depth that accidentally may have been left in the film.

Despite this Grant's charm carries the film safely to it's conclusion with a few belly laughs along the way. But this never excuses the fact that the film lacks the consistency of jokes to survive as comedy or the emotive depth to work as drama. In short it is another film which has lead to the words `romantic comedy' describing films which are generally neither one nor the other."
tt0276751,19,"I have watched About A Boy over and over and each time I seem to love it even more. I really think it's the best film from 2002. It's very rare now for a movie to be this funny and at the same time be just as touching, too. You actually care for the characters in this movie and the ending is satisfying. Hugh Grant is great as Will and it is definitely his best performance. Also, About A Boy just wouldn't be the same without the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy.

It's disappointing that not a lot of people went to see it in theatres since it was in almost direct competition with spider-man and star wars, but now that it's on video do not pass up the chance to see it. I regret I didn't see it sooner.

My Rating: 10/10"
tt0276751,20,"About a Boy is a maudlin puddle of sap that, while billed as a romantic comedy, is neither romantic nor funny.

Every character in the movie is a pale cliche: the crazy hippie, the self-absorbed yuppie, the angry single mother, the dreamy artist, the tattooed motorcycle-jacket lesbian, the nerdy kid who doesn't fit in, the playground bullies, the nose-pierced punk rocker with a heart of gold...one after another these tired stereotypes traipse across the screen, leaving a sugary slime on the ground like a slug slithering over the pavement.

There's only one real laugh in the film, and that's when Hugh Grant turns a volunteer stint working the phones at Amnesty International into an opportunity for phone sex. The rest of the movie is too pious to be funny and too concocted to be emotionally interesting.

It's extremely disheartening to read the litany of moonstruck reviews served up by those who call About a Boy an insightful examination of the contemporary male persona. Hugh Grant's shallow character doesn't have anything to do with the contemporary male persona, or any other male persona for that matter, and thank God for that.

This film is so shamelessly sentimental and badly written that I was literally hiding my face under my sweater in several places out of sheer pain and embarrassment. At other times I was praying to God for the movie to end (checking my watch sadly revealed I was only 45 minutes into the fiasco), and on a later occasion I found myself practicing Buddhist meditation techniques in order to convert the pain of viewing it into an opportunity for growth. It would indeed be fair to say that watching About a Boy is a religious experience.

If you want to see a dashing British comedy of errors about a romantic, bumbling idle young man, go rent an episode of Jeeves and Wooster. It'll beat the socks off of this sad little movie any day of the week."
tt0276751,21,
tt0276751,22,"Realistic. and usefull. because it gives the traits of an entire Peter Pan men generation. because it is a good example of smart performances, adorable humor, lovely story, wise reflection of yourself in the other and about a form of friendship who could be not so rare. so, a necessary film. for a nice evening. and for precise definition of near reality. not the last, for the old fashion comedy status."
tt0276751,23,"Now that IMDb has forced us to read reviews by helpfulness first and only and made it impossible to reorder reviews in the order we might want to read them, I doubt any one-star reviews will see the light of day. Especially for the ""Worthy"" films. Films that promote the narrative. Single guy, living the perfect life is not complete without an annoying, ugly kid, uglier mother and unlikely mid-life crisis. I cringed throughout this dross that anyone could enjoy it or fall for the daft plot. Hugh Grant, I admit, is totally edible throughout. The film is almost worth watching for him alone. Almost."
tt0276751,24,"It's a rom-com but not like your usual, it's between a man and a boy. Two different lives, two different sets of problems but ultimately one thing in common: depression, loneliness and unhappiness. Hugh Grant plays Will, a thirty-something bachelor who lives off family royalties and lives his life responsibility free.. Always on the lookout for women he makes up that he has a son and joins a single parents group. Here he meets a woman and on their first date to the park she brings along her friends son Marcus (played by Nicholas Hoult). Marcus is a socially awkward, bullied teenager who sees Will as a perfect match for his depressed Mother. The relationship that Will and Marcus develop is something special and takes them on a real coming of age journey together.

Nicholas Hoult was only 12 when filming About a Boy and it was his first major role so the pressure was on for him to give a convincing performance when he was the co-lead actor in the movie. He had the support of Hugh Grant so it wasn't on his shoulders to carry the movie on his own but he had a significant amount of screen time and was as an important character as Hugh Grant. His performance was incredibly good, he played the anti-social, shy and nerdy kid extremely well, he didn't just get by, he excelled and really made the character his own. If you've seen Hugh Grant movies before then you will know what to expect from his performance. He complimented Hoult very well, having what seems at first as polar opposite personalities but as the film progresses we see that their differences aren't all that significant. The supporting cast all give solid performances also, adding the depth required convincingly.

The story on paper seems a little far-fetched as it doesn't appear to be a story that would likely be presented in real life or even widely accepted in modern society. The message behind the story is one of desperation, loneliness, depression and companionship. It's touching and emotional at times but then hilariously heart-warming at others. It's a very charming movie that will leave you feeling very satisfied as the credits roll.

tt0276751,26,"An adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, 'About a Boy' is a Delightful film, that is truly fun & amazingly entertaining. I had a ball & wasn't bored even for a minute!

'About a Boy' Synopsis: A cynical, immature young man is taught how to act like a grown-up by a little boy.

'About a Boy' works miraculously as an entertainer. The journey of both of the protagonists is so beautiful & funny, that its intensely infectious. There are moments where I laughed a lot & there were moments when I felt emotional. Its a nearly perfect film about imperfect people.

Peter Hedges, Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz's Adapted Screenplay is exceptionally well-written, with some lovely dialogue, as well. Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz's Direction is fabulous. They've made a truly heartwarming film in all respects. Cinematography & Editing are good.

Performance-Wise: Hugh Grant & Nicholas Hoult are the life of 'About a Boy'. Their on-screen chemistry is outstanding & their performances respectively, are flawless! Toni Collette is another topper. She's simply brilliant here. Rachel Weisz has a brief role, yet she has done well.

On the whole, 'About a Boy' is a complete winner. Two Thumbs Up!"
tt0276751,27,"About a Boy is a charming movie about responsibilities or the lack thereof. It's a low key narrative where a boy has to deal with some realities of life he's not ready for, and where a man is confronted by reality and must connect with it.

Hugh Grant, as usual, has its way with words, but his volume is pretty moderate this time around. Opposite him is Nicholas Hoult as the boy. Their character are very disparate if not entirely opposite, and they play this duality pretty well, one strengthening and helping the other finding some basic truths of life.

All the acting is solid, to the point where you want to slap some sense into Toni Collette's depressive persona. The editing gives us a great pacing, and the story is engrossing and, even if it stays pretty simple, brings a couple of new things to the table, as well as some well worn out ideas. The ""lie"" makes an apparition, but is dealt with in an incredibly mature way. The environment is rich, the important characters deep, the soundtrack sensible, and you'll chuckle a good number of times.

I highly recommend, except if you're looking for action or if you want to avoid sentimentality."
tt0276751,28,"About a Boy (2002)

This is a pretty straight forward light comedy, well done, with no great insights or surprises. Hugh Grant is the anchor, and he not only stars in every scene, he also provides a narrative voice-over, which is dry and funny because he's able to express astonishment at what's happening on screen.

The plot--about a boy, yes, who has a depressive hippy overanxious mother--follows a path through middle class London that might be interesting to Americans for a look at normal life in England. Except of course Grant's character, who is rich by inheritance. Eventually you can see that maybe it is this lazy, selfish young man who is the ""boy"" of the story, because he never quite grew up and the actual boy is more savvy, in some ways, than he is. But this isn't played out as well as you might hope, and the movie ends with a kind of ""all is well in the world"" glow and that's that.

Rachel Weicz, by the way, who has top female billing, is a small element in the movie, and a lifeless one. Anyone might have done as well, and many could have made the magic and romance intended come alive better. The other female lead, the boy's mother, is Toni Collette, who plays an unappealing role with total conviction.

Completely enjoyable, and welterweight, entertainment."
tt0276751,29,This movie was great. It has real emotions. And although it was British i loved it (i have trouble understanding British accents)! It was fantastic and i thought it really showed the way men are and how the boy might actually feel. This movie is awsome and i give it ***** stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rent it or buy it today!
tt0276751,30,"This film has Hugh Grant playing an obnoxious lout who winds up befriending a young boy. This film is now available on video, but I finaly saw it because of its Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. I suppose the screenplay is fairly well written and the supporting performance by Toni Collette as the boys mother is quite good. Grant, however, seems stuck in his mannerisms that continue to make him anoying as an actor. GRADE: B"
tt0276751,31,
tt0276751,32,"For me this movie had a very strong parallel to Jerry Maguire. In both movies, you have handsome, self-involved male leads leading perfect lives. They both have an epiphany that is based on their relationship with a woman and a young boy and the film concentrates on the transformation of the lead character.

I liked About a Boy much better for a couple of reasons. First, Will (Hugh Grant)'s epiphany is much more subtle and happens throughout the film, and happens as a result of him indulging his own character flaws (ie this all starts due to his grand idea of picking up single mothers at a support group meeting). Second, the relationship with the boy is not a slam dunk. Who wouldn't love the kid in Jerry Maguire? The boy here is annoying, self-righteous, talkative and understandably friendless. Dumping him and getting on with his life would have been much more in character for Will - we feel almost like a proud parent as we watch him grow more and more attached to him.

This movie is Hugh Grant's finest hour. He gets to play his handsome, bumbling polite Englishman, but this time, it is wrapped in a selfish playboy with lots of money and no apparant job. A dream life, or so it would seem. Grant effortlessly draws us into this character and allows us to feel the emptiness of his life, but also his frustration and lack of will to change it. As he says, "" I was the star of the Will show and it was not an ensemble drama.""

About a boy is not a chick flick. It is a good-hearted comedy about a man who makes decisions against every selfish instinct that has dictated his life. It is a breath of fresh air in the world of car chases and special effects. I enjoyed this film immensely. ***1/2 out of ****."
tt0276751,33,"Decent movie that has some funny lines, but really drags in the middle. Take your wife/girlfriend and earn some brownie points, but don't expect to be bowled over. The acting is solid, Hugh Grant plays himself, as usual, but just a little more self centered than normal for him. The mother, Toni Collette, is very good. I just don't see this as anywhere near the best movies of the year. I don't think I'll even remember it next month."
tt0276751,34,"ABOUT A BOY (2002) ***1/2 Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collettte, Rachel Weisz, Nat Gastiain Tena. Very funny and surprisingly moving comedy/drama adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel about a trust-fund British thirtysomething slacker (Grant in one of the best roles of his career to date) who is befriended by a troubled yet good natured 12 year old (newcomer Hoult) who wind up bonding and learning some life lessons in the process. Smart and self-effacingly brash screenplay by tag-team filmmaking brothers Weitz, Chris and Paul (who co-scripted with Peter Hedges) finds the crux of their humor lodged squarely in their protagonist's unlikely transformation from self-absorbed narcissist to human being is one of cinema' s rare feats: natural progression of the higher order equals a noble effort in love."
tt0276751,35,"Ok, I can think of about zero films which have made me laugh so much that I have cried - 4 words dead duck scene!!! so funny, omg. what spoilt it a bit was I'd seen a preview of it this morning so I kind of knew what Marcus was going to say, so I started laughing (though I'm sure it sounded more like a cackle to the other people in the cinema) about 3 minutes before he actually said his line and then you saw the duck, it makes me laugh just thinking about it!! Everyone acted really well, I don't usually like Hugh Grant, but I started 2 respect him as an actor in Bridget Jones' Diary, now I have complete respect for him, he is such a talented actor even if all his previous film roles have made him look like a bumbling neanderthal!

For the first time I had 2 fill out a questionnaire for the film company as audience feedback, one of the questions was 'would you recommend this to others?' I ticked 'yes, definately'

This film is well acted, well written, I cannot comment on the book-to-screen thing because i havent read the book, but otherwise I love this film, and will recommend it to everyone 10/10 excellent"
tt0276751,36,"John Cusack and co. did such a fine job adapting Nick Hornby's High Fidelity that it was going to be a tough act to beat. Combine that with Hugh Grant's performance in last year's Bridget Jones' Diary and expectations are going to be quite high. Well, quite simply it succeeds due to a very skillful adaptation and more than anything Grant's performance. The problems (I felt) with the book have been removed (the character of Ellie) and replaced with slightly new problems (again, just my opinion). All the performances are top-notch and the Weitz brothers have done an excellent job (both co-adapting and directing). Nice to see that the London setting of the book is kept and also fun to see an Arsenal football club pendant in one of the character's room - Hornby's favourite football team that he wrote about with such infectious passion in Fever Pitch.

Minor quibbles aside - well worth watching."
tt0276751,37,"Don't worry : this movie is (kind of) funny. Usually when Hugh Grant is involved that's the one thing you can be reasonably sure about. But whether this is a movie that will stay with you for longer than it takes to see it.... It's a pretty flimsy story about a guy who is basically happy. Which is the first point of criticism : movies about happy people are mostly boring. So, the script writer must have thought, let's start with a happy guy and make him unhappy. As the movie progresses the basic philosophy of the movie becomes clearer : the only way to happiness is by becoming the most average and mainstream character you can imagine. Eccentric is wrong ! Mediocre is the highest good ! Because the main personage is happy being eccentric he has to be made aware of the fact that is actually unhappy because he is not like everyone else. By the end he becomes like anyone else you've ever met and passed on the street and THUS must be happy. Very strange philosophy... One word about the young Nicholas Hoult : his character Marcus says he's not as good as Haley Joel Osmond and therefor has to go to school. He's right about that alright. I couldn't help but noticing that as the movie progresses the acting style of Nicholas starts to resemble mr. Grants' more and more. All in all : wrong philosophy, some funny scenes, nothing you'll miss if you haven't seen it."
tt0276751,38,"Let me explain. This movie isn't (much of the time anyway) unpleasant; it's just not pleasant. I didn't for the most part find it enjoyable to watch. It has a few scenes in it which are somewhat humorous, but overall I found this a heavy kind of movie. Yes, it's hopeful - in a way. It brings lonely, sad and even depressed people together and lets them build a sort of family connection with one another so that by the end there's a sort of heartwarming scene of a very diverse and eclectic group of people gathering to celebrate Christmas with an extended-family feel, but that quasi-hopeful ending struck me as empty to be honest. There was no sense that any of this was going to last; no sense of permanence. These folks for this point in time were together. Yeah - there's something to be said for that, but for me at least it didn't overcome the overall sombre feel to this ""comedy.""

Hugh Grant has never really overwhelmed me. I've never quite understood the appeal he has for many people. His movies are usually pleasant in an understated, silly sort of way, and generally he plays variations on the same character - either the lost, lovelorn single guy or the guy who wants to avoid any serious commitments. He's the same here; although less likable than many of his characters: lazy, shallow, manipulative. Here his character of Will latches on the the idea of pretending to be a single father so that he can meet single mothers. In the course of the deception, he connects with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) - a sad, lonely, bullied 12 year old boy with a suicidal mother (Fiona, played by Toni Collette.) In fact, what really causes the bond in the relationship between Will and Marcus is when they discover Fiona after her suicide attempt. Marcus bonds afterward with the at first less than enthusiastic Will, and the two of them have to sort their way through life and their own relationship - all the while trying to build new relationships with those around them.

I have to confess that this just didn't capture me. Yes, there were a few funny scenes, but I never really got the sense of what this was trying to accomplish, and after Fiona's suicide attempt I was puzzled. The single mother of a 12 year old boy attempts suicide, doesn't seem to be in the hospital for long, and then just goes home and takes up her role as a single mom again? In a way, that was really the vehicle for pushing this movie along, but it made no sense to me. There was also the problem that I didn't really like any of the characters - there was a shallowness and a phoniness to all of them. I could admire Marcus' devotion to helping his mom get better, I suppose, but beyond that none of them struck a chord with me. None of this really connected with me. (3/10)"
tt0276751,39,"Turning Nick Hornby's sarcastically melancholic read-in-one-day bestseller into a movie with Hugh Grant as the main character Will should be a sure thing. The book's structure involves some obviously cinematic elements, so the filmmakers had the screenplay lying practically finished before them.

Still, they managed to mess it up. Chris and Paul Weitz were a tiny bit too ambitious in making the film their own work. They left out character elements that are absolutely central in the book (like Marcus's childlike lack of sarcasm)  which, of course, is perfectly allowed in a film but still a pity. They cut out important scenes because they found them boring, which is why audiences who do not know the book are completely over-taxed by the mass of characters that are introduced and cleared out again within a few scenes (like Clive, Marcus's father, or Ellie, his first love).

Finally, they changed the last third, including, of course, the ending of the story. They did it, I suspect, only because they didn't want to play the film in the present and not in the middle of the 1990s, so they would have had to either distort history or leave out the entire Kurt Cobain story. So they were forced to invent a completely new ending. I do not think that the plots of books are sacrileges (on the contrary: I think they needn't be more than a matter of inspiration for the screenplays based upon them) but the ending they made up in this case, simply destroyed the whole story. It made it sentimental (not very sentimental but too sentimental), stale and abrupt. Whenever a filmmaker chooses to make major changes in a plot previously published, they must re-imagine the entire plot, otherwise the whole movie usually becomes a mess.

The book About a Boy fascinated me partly because it was funny and sad at the same time. The film About a Boy is either funny only or neither. What a pity."

tt0276751,41,"Again I have to disagree, only this time I differ not only with the critics, but also with the wider public. So, it's either the usual excuse that I am simply too stupid to understand such an artistic masterpiece, or I must try to figure out what it was that most viewers found to be so appealing about this otherwise boring and ridiculous motion picture. As much as I tried, I couldn't see it, until my wife made a comment that suddenly made it all clear for me. She said:

'The viewers are happy because now Will has also become a loser like everybody else...'

Of course, that's it, Will is hated by the viewers because he personifies all that they always wanted to be but couldn't. The viewers are jealous. So when by some mystic force he discovers that being 'normal' is the essence of life and happiness and transforms himself from being charming and successful into a regular everyday loser, people love it! He comes down from his pedestal and becomes like them! We have therefore been served yet another pathetic lecture in morality from Hollywood and the likes, but I mustn't complain, the general public seems to need it, and likes it too. How sad."
tt0276751,42,"A novel by Nick Hornby, is the basis for this film directed by Chris and Paul Weitz. It concerns Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) a well off, single man quite satisfied living alone and enjoying the carefree Bachelor's life. At the same time a young twelve-year-old boy named Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) who enjoys singing to himself, bullied at school, and is hard pressed living with a single, lonely, depressed and suicidal-prone mother. By themselves they are in desperate need of companionship, but once they discover each other, they realize their needs are similar. The answer to both their problems is met when they learn, Life is sharing and each has more to offer than they believe possible. The film is a delight to view as we watch both Characters trying desperately to solve their personal dilemmas without asking for help. Thus the quote 'No Man is an Island' becomes important. All in all, the movie strikes a cord for anyone seeking comfort in the solace of independence. In this day and age where single parents have become the norm, this film offers more than just humor, it illustrates the fact, everyone needs someone. Easily recommended. ****"

Will freeman other wises known as Hugh Grant defiantly the best man for the job performed an amazing show the director's Paul & Chris Weitz's own Best British film of the year award but should of one more. it is about a man Will and a 12 year old boy Marcus who turns wills life upside down a funny yet powerful movie which you can be assured of a laugh or two from. the BEST film of all time i urge you to watch it P.S. watch the deleted scenes on the DVD which just fills in the movie all the bits missed on the film you can find them on the bonus material a well put together film i would give this film 5/5 CRACKING"
tt0276751,45,"About a boy kind of flew under the radar for me as I'm sure it did for many others. I finally got around to seeing it recently on DVD and I can say with much certainty that it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I guess I was expecting a typical sort of Hugh Grant romantic comedy, but it's nothing like that at all. I found it very similar in tone to movies like Rushmore and even American Beauty, but with a lot more laughs than either of those dramedies.

I've never felt too strongly one way or another about Hugh Grant, but he is spot-on perfect in this film as a rich bachelor who lives off his father's money and doesn't have a care in the world. He prides himself on living a life of luxury and comfort, and avoiding complicated relationships. Cleary one of his best performances, Grant's interpretation of Will is shallow and cynical but layered with potential. By chance, he enters the life of a depressed single mother (Toni Collette) and her 12 year old son (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some type of a male role model. There's a lot going on and several different sub-plots but essentially events unfold that further entangle Will into these people's lives. And ultimately he must decide if he is going to withdraw to his posh apartment and stay disconnected from people, or face the music and accept that truly no man is an island.

Nicholas Hoult also gives a very strong performance for a first time actor. This is one of those films where every actor seems to be the ideal choice for the character they play, right down to the smallest roles. The moments of hilarious comedy are nicely balanced with a serious, at times melancholy, story. I'm sure there are some deep lessons here about how families can be created in all kinds of different circumstances, and are not always defined by bloodlines alone. Or about maturity, growing up, and finding meaning in life. All of that is probably true, but at the end of the day About a Boy is just a very enjoyable, funny movie that is well worth an hour and a half. An awesome soundtrack too makes this a must see film."
tt0276751,46,"This was a more personal movie than I expected. First of all, I was very much like Marcus when I was 12. Picked on all the time, son of a single mother, stood out more than I wanted to (which wasn't at all).

And if I had the money, I would be very much like Will. Maybe not as shallow, but you never know.

On the technical side, this movie was very well done. Hugh Grant can act, and can act very well. The kid who played Marcus was awesome. The supporting characters don't just come in when the story demands it, but they exist out of the frame too. You believe that these people have lives outside of what we see.

I think what I liked best was that Will (Hugh Grant) isn't a charictiture of the 'shallow/loner' guy. His character changes subtly. Hugh Grant plays him very balanced. You know that there is something deeper that he just isn't showing us.

Nicholas Hoult's work as Marcus is also very well done. He doesn't play Marcus as just a cute kid. He plays him as a real kid. I can see Nicholas actually being like this off set. One scene that sticks out in my mind is when he's sitting in class, thinking about the song 'Rainy days and Mondays' and starts to sing it out loud, oblivious to the fact that he's in class. I can't speak for everyone, but I for one know that I have done this. I connected with this character. I believe that Marcus is real, and his problems are real.

See this film. It's not laugh out loud funny, but it's honest. If you want an intelligent movie to watch on a rainy day (or Monday), enjoy this one."
tt0276751,47,"While not being one of his three outings with Richard Curtis, this is still one of the films that Hugh Grant is best known for.

When I first saw it I instantly dismissed it. Whereas 'Curtis world' is happy and jolly this film actually surprises you by dealing with some pretty heavy issues. The DVD cover makes it out to be much more cheery than it actually is.

Grant gives a good performance, albeit one that isn't far away from any other role that he has played before or since. Nicholas Hoult gave his break out performance here, and has rightly gone onto other things.

I can't say this is my favourite Hugh Grant film, or even the one he will be remembered for, but it's an interesting enough film."
tt0276751,48,"Will (Hugh Grant) is something of a loner and even that is an understatement. He lives off of the royalties from a hit Christmas song that his father wrote and he does no actual work. Instead, his days are spent in shopping, getting his hair styled, and watching his favorite television shows. But, being a manly man, he does want to connect with members of the female population, from time to time. For goodness sake, though, no one ever better mention the word marriage in his presence! When some friends fix him up with a single mother, Will discovers a goldmine, or so he thinks. Single mothers are more concerned about their children and are more wary about making commitments, which is good news indeed for Will. Learning about a meeting for parents without partners, Will goes off eagerly to the affair, hoping to scope out some nice Bettys. But, unexpectedly, he makes the acquaintance of a single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette) and her somewhat nerdy son, Marcus. By some strange inner intuition, Marcus sees Will as a mate and begins coming over to Will's apartment, spending serious time with the consummate bachelor. But, is Will just pretending to be nice to an equally lonesome young man? This is an outstanding movie, with superb laughs and superb messages. No one could have played the part of Will as Grant does, with great humor and feeling. It is Grant's finest hour, absolutely. Similarly, the rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, is very nice indeed. The production looks swell, with lovely costumes, great London scenery, and beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, it is the story and script that is most outstanding in accounting for the film's greatness. In fact, you would be hardpressed to find a movie that delivers such big laughs AND such important messages as this one does. It is definitely about time that you, and everyone else on the planet, got a hold of this film, for it is a surefire amelioration of the dismal, daily life splashed across the newspapers of the world."
tt0276751,49,"Really loved this film. Only just saw it now late on USA Network, and gotta say, if there's a film it's OK for a guy to cry on, this is it (and 'Brian's Song', of course). It's the perfect Hugh Grant role, a 'guy' belatedly becoming a 'man' by meeting his own inner child, and this time really thru a child. It's a place most of us guys either grudgingly or not at all like to see or even admit exists, that vulnerable and mysterious place only other humans can discover/touch/hurt/reach. A great film beautifully done. And a truly touching and expert job by Mr. Grant....again. And I only just discovered he shares my Birthday, explaining his great talent. Aloha..."
tt0276751,50,"Rather flat interpretation of an excellent book. Taking an English book, with English actors and producing a Hollywood play. And after struggling through what should have been an easy script with great lines finishes even flatter. Hi fidelity was a brilliant Nick Hornby but mind you they had actors who can do more than 2d acting. Toni Collette comes out unscathed but thats about it. Granted it is a more modern interpretation of a nineties setting but i think it was a little machinelike. The soundtrack is the only outstanding mention. Badly drawn boy add more than the adapted screenplay perhaps because they are original. Average movie at best. Not a terrible movie but no where near great. A five out of ten."
tt0276751,51,"Even though I haven't read the book, if you ask me, ABOUT A BOY is a good film that's very hilarious and touching. In my opinion, Will (Hugh Grant) really was a die-hard bachelor. You'll understand why once you've read the book and seen this movie. Also, if you ask me, despite the fact that we wasn't like everybody else, to me, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) was a kind boy with a good heart. I felt really sorry for him when he was teased and tormented at school. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. In conclusion, if you like Hugh Grant films or enjoyed Nick Hornby's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to have you laughing and crying from start to finish."
tt0276751,52,"After going through a summer with varying degrees of crappy movies I decided to hit up this film which I haven't seen in a while. I realized I was watching nothing short of magic. This is a romantic comedy with a true heart and it knows how to tug at it. Hugh Grant gives a brilliant performance as Will, a rich bachelor who befriends a young boy who is having parental issues much to his dismay. But he actually grows attached to this child. The story is a bit predictable but it is the relationship that this man and boy share that is captivating. Once you start this film you become engrossed in it. The film is genuinely funny and insanely sweet. This is a film not to be missed especially when you have re-hashed rubbish being recycled over and over again. It is a true breath of fresh air."
tt0276751,53,"I love British films but it was incredibly hard to believe that Weitz brothers, who have made miserable American Pies films, could have made any worthy film. I was so wrong! About a Boy is an excellent film, definitely in my top five of 2002 and even more, it is in my all-time top ten. First of all it's really hard to decide what genre exactly is this film. At first sight it look more like romance comedy but after you have watched it more carefully and more than once it become obviously that About a Boy is an intelligent inspiring drama. This film is a very rare case when some comedy elements incredibly well harmonize with more important and complicated elements of drama.

There are many reasons for considering this film as a masterpiece. First of all it's the script. At first it's in many parts different from the Nick Hornby's book, so some people who love the book can be disappointed, though screenwriters despite all changes were able to catch the book's atmosphere. So the story is a bit simpler and at the same time more positive than in the book. It contains lots of wit, heart and believability. This is a story about two leading characters Will and Marcus. Will (Hugh Grant character) is a 38 years old single man. His father years ago wrote a famous Christmas song and after his death Will has received the author's rights for the song and continually gets the money from them. He has never been working more than month or two in a row and his lifestyle is very simple. First: every man is an island. And the second: I don't care about others and no one cares about me. He spends all of his time watching TV, shopping CD and other things, stylizing his hair and dating with his girlfriends. After one of his dates he invents a new idea about dating single mothers and taking off before their relations become too serious. That seems perfect to him but when he meets 12 years old Marcus his life begin to change. I think Hugh Grant was an ideal choice for Will (in my opinion it's his best performance so far). He is always very good as a comedy actor and in About a Boy he proves his acting ability not only as a shallow comedy star. Will character could have been at least unpleasant and it is only bright charming Hugh Grant performance give us the impression that Will not as bad as he looks. There are also many minor, almost unnoticeable details which confirm such impression. Marcus is a 12 years old, smart and sensitive but gawky boy, who lives with his depressed mother Fiona (Toni Collette), perfectly played by a new rising star Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant as Marcus. His acting is so powerful and emotional that it's impossible to look at his character without strong sympathy. Marcus easily became outcast in the school and in the whole society. He seeks a kind of refuge in Will house and while they spend time together Will learns new things about himself and take some life lessons. Will's evolution and awakening from a selfish idler to a really warm and likable character is perfectly shown through this film. These two main characters are so real that it's easy for many people to find some similarities with them. The good point is that the story never becomes predictable even for people who have read the book. Though the dialogs in the movie are quite different from the book, they are well written, funny and memorable. The music written by Badly Drawn Boy (absolutely new name for me) is quite suitable and original. It supplies some additional charms to the story. And about the comedy parts. I must say that I can't remember another film when such strong and touching drama makes you smile and laugh so many times. This film is very heartfelt and it carries lots of inspiring and smart messages. In the conclusion About a Boy is an excellent, entertained and enjoyable film, which deserves to be taken more serious than most of people did. Could this movie have been better? In conditions of such changed script that seems unlikely to me. So it's not quite a perfect adaptation of one of my favorite books but nevertheless as a movie it's almost perfect masterpiece.

10 out of 10 or solid A (one of the best of the year). Sorry for my bad English."
tt0276751,54,"the book must have been written with hugh grant in mind because he is just perfect.he was so good in NOTTING HILL and ,who cares, he is so good in this.so who cares if he's playing hugh grant, if he's this good so what!the storyline is all of our fantasies basically..good looking guy,financially substansable,need i go on???but redemption(redemption who needs redemption),is at hand in the shape of marcus a clever but inneffectual young boy who ,i think, resembles the boy will actually wanted to be.will missed out out on the vital things in life and in his own words wants ""bite sized chunks"".through marcus he sees another way,albeit unwillingly,to see another life.hence is use as an apropos son to seduce rahel weizz.the ending is rather chunkily put together! THEY ALL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.but in keeping with the film's feel it sort of fitted."
tt0276751,55,"If you're looking to get away from the big-budget-ultra-hyped movies of the past few years, you definitely can't overlook About a Boy. Hugh Grant as always lights up the screen with yet another quirky character. Somehow though, you just won't tire of his portrayal as Will. He's real. Most movies in this genre leave you saying, yeah right. That's plausible 'eye roll'; Not this time though. Nicholas Hoult is a wonderful addition as Marcus the ""different"" 12 year old boy who changes Will's life forever, teaching us a few things about life along the way. It's not a sappy cry your eyes out chick flick, so even you guys can get a kick out of this one."
tt0276751,56,"Hugh Grant doesn't have a huge register, but he knows his job and knows what he's doing. The story is made to make you feel good, not surprising of course, but the people are slightly different from what they would be in American movies. Especially Toni Collette, who are doing fine here.

Watch it, like it, forget it. That's it really."
tt0276751,57,"This is the best British film I've seen since Secrets and Lies. It's much funnier than Nick Hornby's novel - and unlike the book, which just sort of peters out, it boasts a superb feelgood ending that almost moved me to tears. Acting, script and direction are all top-notch - plus it's bloody funny."
tt0276751,58,"Starts with an interesting plot, then lost the momentum, and then regained it back to end it with a high note. That's what I felt while watching this movie. Overall, an above average feel good."
tt0276751,59,"It was a nice, funny and laughable film. I learned that the film is a book adaptation: I watched a movie. I liked it and gave it 8 points. The next morning, ""This movie is American and very beautiful. this can not be."" This is the movie industry in American space age.

The characters in the movie were nice. I do not like the end. Packed it up quickly. Other than that, the typists bothered. It was a classic. It was a funny and traceable film.

The duck scene was very beautiful."
tt0276751,60,"This is a typical saturday evening movie where you don't want to get up from your couch, you are feeling lazy and all you wanna do is eat something good and watch something that will not make your head hurt. I liked this movie pretty much, especially with Hugh Grant in it and his typical english behaviour. In this movie he exceeds himself in acting beyond my expectations along with the boy who was as good as him. The story is nothing special, it is a straight forward movie, but thoughtful and emotional."
tt0276751,61,"In the film About a Boy, Will is a rich man that invents a son to meet women in a support group for single parents. After a series of events that leads him to get close to a young boy named Marcus, Will starts to mature an instead wants to take care of him and have a mature relationship with a business woman. Will is an unlikable character that becomes more likable as the film goes on, through trials that test his loyalty to the people who matter the most. The film seems to be more of a character piece, as the writing concentrates more on Will's development than anything else. Its still a good film regardless and I would recommend it."
tt0276751,62,"I'm not quite sure why I like this movie as much as I do. It's a film that draws you in with its humorous but sobering, authentic and honest look at life, love, single-hood, relationships, and family. Grant does a brilliant job at making you love, despise and sympathize with him as he attempts to find love by faking to be a father in an effort to win over a girl. He learns more than he signed up for as he learns what life and love is truly about. I think every guy should watch this film as it encapsulates what our approach to life can so often turn into and hopefully will cause many to stop and think, is this really what my POV of life should be. The line ""But driving behind the ambulance was absolutely fantastic"" tops my favorite lines in a movie. Though not the inspirational nor blockbuster of the year, it's continued to be one of my favorite movies that I can always throw on and enjoy."
tt0276751,63,"We can say anything about Hugh Grant, but not that he is bad at his job. I believe this is his most mature, perhaps the best performance of his career. We see something that we did not have a chance to see before in Grant's career. We are able feel Will's progress from a completely hopeless eternal child, to the man who finally decided to participate in the life around him. Markus is a compelling portrait of all of us at some point in life, when we were so lost that, not only we did not have the answers, but we were not even aware of the issues. The movie is spicy, but not because they play on humor but because they are extremely honest about the people and their weaknesses."
tt0276751,64,"This movie is one of the very few to use the dual-narrator device to make it work - and magnificently so. Hugh Grant's unabashed self-assessment of his shallowness and why he did what he did is refreshing and fits him so perfectly as an actor, it should be a requisite. Young Mr. Hough's performance for a juvenile actor is stunningly perfect and drives the character. Toni Colette's vegan grown-up-hippie and chronically depressed mother is brilliantly conceived and executed by one of the best actresses of our era. Around this perfectly conceived and believable exposition are terrific supporting performances including Rachael Weisz and a terrific eye for detail from the director. I just love this movie more every time I watch it and I've seen it five times."
tt0276751,65,"Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) thinks of himself as a self-sufficient island. He doesn't need any connections or dependents. He's never worked a real job in his life, living off the royalties of his father one big hit song. After a setup by his sister, he finds that single moms make for the best dating potential. Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) is a freakish outcast at his school, and his mother is suicidal. Will and Marcus are brought together by a lie and a single parent help group.

Based on a Nick Hornby novel, it is a comedy about a man growing up helping a boy and his fears. It is a witty film about family and friendship. Most of all, it's about love and the need for human connections. The characters are well drawn. Importantly, Hugh Grant is at the top of his game, and there is a great newcomer in Nicholas Hoult."
tt0276751,66,
tt0276751,67,"I finally gave in and decided to give this film a look. This movie had heaps of praise, and now I see why! It's perceptively funny and refreshingly sincere in its approach. Movies like this are why I still believe in the magic of movie making. About a Boy could have easily gone the pretentious route, but it strayed away from it completely. It takes a considerable amount of skill to make a pathetic womanizer like Will (Hugh Grant) as likable as he was, and also a lot of charisma on Hugh Grant's part. It shows you how stale life manages to get sometimes, and how nothing can seem to get you out of that funk, and all it takes is finding treasure in the strangest of places. Grant and Nicholas Hoult's chemistry is uncannily good. It was an absolute joy to watch them evolve together and balance each other out; I thank you gentlemen. Both are fantastic. He may be grown up now, but I dare you to find a child that can pull off a performance like Hoult did. You won't find many. Toni Collette is excellent as the suicidal mother with a heart of gold. Her actions are questionable, but her heart is there. She is very vital to this film's success. Any complaints? Not really. The finale got a wee bit silly for my liking, but it was so charming with the way it was done, I really didn't care. It had heart and that's all I cared about in the long run.

Final Thoughts: Seeing gems like this one makes me weep in ways when I see Adam Sandler making millions off of garbage like Jack & Jill or Grown Ups. Don't take so long to see this movie like I did. See it as soon as you possibly can. It'll warm even the coldest of hearts

tt0276751,68,"Here is a movie whose screenplay is captivating, the screenplay is an adaptation from a book and it was well done by Peter Hedges and actor Hugh Grant never performed better in any lead role since, making his performance in this film his most critical acclaimed.

This 2002 British comedy drama film is directed by brothers Chris Weitz (The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)) and Paul Weitz (Little Fockers (2010)). About a boy is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. Nick who is author of other film adaptations like Fever Pitch in 2005 and High Fidelity in 2000, allowed Hedges and the brother to work on the screenplay by themselves since the only film adaptation he worked on the screenplay is the 1997 British adaptation of Fever Pitch, which starred Colin Firth.

About a boy is about Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) who lives a very carefree comfortable life in London, where Will doesn't work thanks to overly sufficient royalties left to him by his father from a successful Christmas song that his father composed. Due to this Will has enough time to meet women and has random sexual relationships with practically every woman he meets.

Will soon discovered that single mothers are the easiest to get in bed, so he tried to nab as much as he can, his quest led him to meet Suzie and his dying need to get her in bed led him to meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old son of Suzie's friend, Fiona (Toni Collette). A weird relationship developed between the two in a mentor and mentee kind of way, that made Will have more of a apart in Marcus life than he planned to.

About a boy was a commercial success, making over 130 million dollars in the box office which is almost 7 times its production cost. The movie itself was a critical acclaim, with the AFI (American Film Institute) naming it one of the best as one of the ten best movies of the year 2002 and it holds a 93% approval rating on the critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.

About a boy also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Hugh Grant was also nominated for a Golden Globe award. Although Grant didn't win any notable awards he did win some not so notable ones including the Golden Camera (Goldene Kamera is an annual German film and television award, awarded by the television magazine HÖRZU.) award for Best International Actor.

About a boy is just sweet and lovable and it will make you smile and it is a nice DVD to own.

tt0276751,70,"""About a Boy"" is about two boys who both don't fit in with society. One is a twelve-year-old trying to fit in at a new school, and the other is a 38-year-old man-child who has never worked, never married and never had children, and never plans to.

Hugh Grant is funny and vulnerable as Will, a bachelor who decides to date single mothers. Through one of his attempts, he meets Marcus (played excellently by Nicholas Hoult), who struggles with bullies and has to take care of his suicidal mother.

I found the film to be very funny and poignant, keeping a good balance between comedy and drama. The acting is very underrated with flawless performances by Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, and Toni Collette. The only thing that I would have changed would have been to reference Nirvana and their song, ""About a Girl"", which gave the movie its title. Overall I would recommend this to fans of Hugh Grant and coming-of-age tales."
tt0276751,71,"The book is an excellent read, while more extensive in its story elements and structure, it is funny, moving and compelling. The movie is also very, very good. I personally would have liked the first half of the movie especially to have slowed down a tad, some of it felt rushed and skimmed through. And while it is not as extensive or quite as developed as the book, it is every bit, if not more so, as funny, moving and as compelling. The whole movie is beautifully filmed, the soundtrack is beguiling, the excellent is suitably adroit and the script is funny, sharp and witty. And the more poignant scenes were genuinely so. The whole cast give sterling performances, Hugh Grant is on excellent form, and Nicholas Hoult is very believable as the troubled boy. Sharon Small, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz also are solid. All in all, a very good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
tt0276751,72,"Will is self centred and has cast off all his responsibilities. But during one of his more dubious scams to date single mothers, he is forced to reconsider his moral fibre after coming into contact with a 12 year old outcast named Marcus.

Adapted from the massively popular book written by Nick Hornby {Fever Pitch & High Fidelity} About A Boy easily translates well to the screen without truly breaking free of the modest premise. Oddly enough for such a British picture, this is directed by an American, Paul Weitz, who along with his brother Chris, brought the world American Pie!. It works, largely to the undervalued comic talents of one Hugh Grant {Will}. I would go so far as to say that without Grant leading the film, this would have been a flop, all the highlights on offer are when Grant is on the screen. Expressive with his face and delivering his lines with a natural high, Grant nicely lures the audience into the less than admirable Will's hands. Which is quite a trick considering that Will is a morally dubious scum bag!.

Nicholas Hoult {Marcus} is OK as child actors go, but here he is given far to much to do. Which is another reason why Grant is so important to the film being a success, he shoulders much of the emotional burden, letting Hoult breathe what life he can into poor young Marcus {worst hair cut on film ever}. Solid support comes from Toni Collette and Rachael Weisz, and Weitz's direction is smooth and unobtrusive, with Badly Drawn Boy's score an integral part of the story. Yet as much as i enjoy the film myself, i still feel frustrated that it didn't turn out better than it did. A double handed narration from both lead characters intrudes on the flow of the plot, and the pay off is ultimately an ""oh"" moment. So to me it's an OK movie made into a good one courtesy of one of Britain's best light comedy actors. 7/10"
tt0276751,73,"Will (Hugh Grant) is the envy of every man. He doesn't work, drives a fast car, enjoys casual relationships, and at 38 has rid his life of all responsibilities...until he meets Marcus. A unique 12 year old boy who turns his life upside down.

Hugh Grant as Will was expertly cast. He was hilarious, charming, and ridiculously attractive - perfect :) He played his part effortlessly and provided a lot of the humour throughout the movie, though this was subtly taken over by the many moving, sweet moments that he also contributed. This is arguably his best ever performance. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, I hate to admit, was very very VERY good. I saw the TV show in which he stars, 'Skins', and thought he, and the show, were both awful. But I have to say he was great as Marcus. Rachel Weisz appears only halfway through the film and was decent enough I guess, she didn't have much to do (and seemed pretty bored doing it anyway). Toni Collette as Marcus's mum was fantastic. I actually thought she was a hippie with issues - that's how well cast she was!

On the whole, About A Boy is an unforgettable and heartwarming Britcom, that does complete justice to the novel."
tt0276751,74,"This was much better than I'd expected, not quite the routine Hugh Grant fluffy pleasant comedy. Not that it's deep, just funnier, the juxtaposition of good and bad times made it an excellent film. A fine cast around him too. All in all, worth one's time. I haven't seen the Marcus character in anything else since, at least not that I've noticed. Check this one out. Collette is a bit of an odd one, can truly make herself look different, she was a great choice for the mother and Rachel Weisz, for someone who's seen her only in the Mummy movies, was refreshing. This is a nice upbeat movie for all, not just those who like that kind of thing."
tt0276751,75,
tt0276751,76,"Hugh Grant was excellent in this film. He has an understated manner which fitted in with the tenor of the dialogue. Very good to see a film where there are no AK47's stuttering, no foul language (well, only a couple of times) and no screaming and shouting and overacting to hype up the viewers. Marcus, the boy, was believable and worked well with Grant. The Brits still, in my opinion, make the most watchable films. They are truer to life. The women were attractive and did not look as though a plastic surgeon had tried to change them into some display dummy. Any age group could watch this and enjoy it. There is no sex for the voyeurs, and no violence for the sadists. (What a pity for them.) The acting was first class, the storyline was gentle and amusing, no mistakes in casting, many subtle satiric scenes and an appropriate setting made this an enjoyable film."
tt0276751,77,"I saw ""About a Boy"" as part of a double feature with another movie that I actually wanted to see, and I was not enthusiastic about ""About a Boy"". I can't remember what the other movie was, but I remember ""About a boy"". It was surprisingly fantastic. It had a very suiting soundtrack and a good plot. It was quite heavy in narration, which is usually a bad sign, but it was done masterfully. The narration did an excellent job of supporting the flow of the film, kept it very real, and added a great deal to the humor. A great blend of drama and humor that quickly became one of my favorite films. ""About a Boy"" is a movie I think you could be surprised by."
tt0276751,78,"What I liked about this film was that it didn't ""guild the lily"" with any of its characters. In particular, Marcus's mother, who is clinically depressed, is presented correctly as emotionally numb and pretty much oblivious to those around her. This is quite different from the usual (erroneous) Hollywood version of effusive, and usually loquacious, sadness. Even the boy, who is the real hero of the story, is allowed to be not-all-that-likable. Beyond the movie itself, I really enjoyed the interview with High Grant that was included on the DVD. He was honest enough to admit that he genuinely does not much care for children, and so the discomfort and emotional distance between Will and Marcus is not fake. I think he mentioned insisting that they not cast a kid who was going to want to hug him or something similar, and that comes across clearly in the film, adding to rather than detracting from the texture of the story."
tt0276751,79,"The enormously popular British novelist Nick Hornby writes books about men who, rather than outgrow their arrested development, concoct ridiculous strategies to remain irresponsible and selfish. Presumably, men like his stories because they see guys screwing up in ways they wish they could. And women seem to go for them because they love the man-child ideaup to a point that is, because Hornby always sees to it that his hero's m.o. backfires, shoving him into adulthood and, as a bonus, shaping him into a sensitive human being. Such was the fate of John Cusack's Rob Gordon in High Fidelity (2000), the first hit movie based on a Hornby bestseller, and so it goes for Hugh Grant's Will in this Hornby adaptation. Will is a cad who, in order to meet women, fakes his way into a single parents support group. The plot banks a couple hairpin turns to introduce a despondent mother (Toni Collette) and her wise-beyond-his-years son (Nicholas Hoult). The two guysthe man-child and the child-manbuddy up and, after another tumble of events, the kid beards as the man's son so Will can seduce another woman (Rachel Weisz).

Deception in close quarters and its ensuing complications have always been fundamental to romantic comedy. It's the single common factor running through the best-in-class list: Trouble in Paradise, It Happened One Night, My Man Godfrey, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Nothing Sacred, Easy Living, Bringing Up Baby, The Shop Around the Corner, The Philadelphia Story, His Girl Friday, The Lady Eve, The Palm Beach Story, The More the Merrier, Sullivan's Travels, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Born Yesterday, Roman Holiday, Pillow Talk, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Georgy Girl, The Graduate, Shampoo, Tootsie, Prizzi's Honor, Moonstruck, Bull Durham, Flirting with Disaster, and There's Something About Mary. Each of these pictures, though, wastes little time introducing their characters or setting up their premises in order kick off the comedy. That one (or both) of the lovers has something to hide is a generic given. What makes them funny is how ingeniously they juggle their circumstances and how, as the lies pile up, they put themselves at greater risk. About a Boy misses this point completely. It drags us through the set-up step by stepthere's not a blithe bone in its body. And, just to make things worse, the child keeps dropping nuggets of wisdom and few, if any, things can be more annoying to watch than a killjoy kid doling out life lessons to stupid adults. (Didn't anybody on this movie suffer through Jerry Maguire?)

Grant turns in his standard dithering, non-plussed performance; sometimes it's hard to discern if it's Will or Hugh who's confused about the situation he's in. He seems smaller than usual here, too, a pinball careering off the plot's bumpers and pitfalls. Every time he takes on one of these piffling roles, some critic gets beside himself and compares him to Cary Grant. The stretch could not be wider, however. Cary was always a man caught in situations that forced him to behave childishly. Hugh is our Tony Curtishe's only charming when he's trying to catch up with the adults (who often don't even try to conceal their condescension toward him). Stuck as we are with morons (Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson) and schmucks (Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler) dominating our romantic comedies, Grant is always a welcome change. About a Boy's agenda, though, is lining things up so Will/Grant will learn how to act his age. In the process, it turns its typically nimble, engaging star into a thumping bore."
tt0276751,80,"It's a rare thing to find Hugh Grant playing something different from his usual romcom heroes. In this case, he's much better playing Will like people than the Four Weddings... guy he played. Also, he's more good-looking with short spikey hair than that ludicrous floppy hair.

About A Boy is actually quite simple: we have Will, a guy who has never done anything at all significant in his life and has thus never really grown up, and he meets Marcus, a poor 12-year-old who has grown up to quickly without really realising it, is bullied at school, he's killed a duck with a loaf of bread and his mother has just tried to kill herself.

Bizarrely the two end up reluctant friends, and manage to give each other a healthy dose of some much needed medicine: Marcus opens his eyes to his own pitiful circumstances, and Will gets back in touch with reality. Well... sort of...

Incredibly, the film keeps to the story lines of Nick Hornby's book, and is much better because of it. Hugh Grant is actually convincing, I guess a testament to his apparently depressing life at the time (apparently), and Nicholas Hoult is a very talented young actor, playing Marcus perfectly. Pity about that kid's TV show he did afterwards though, Star, was it called?

Don't miss these two killing us 'softly' with their song..."
tt0276751,81,"I really liked this film. I didn't think it would be as good as it was, and that's because of a terrible feeling I have about Hugh Grant. There's just something about him... that... I don't know how to describe it. I think it's to do with the fact that he always plays the 'same-ish floppy-haired Englishman'. But when I stop and think about it... Four weddings is alright, and he's actually quite funny. Notting Hill is alright... and this was really good. Maybe I should give him a break!

The story all revolves around the 12 year-old (Marcus), and the fact that he (and his mother) don't have any 'back-up' in life. Will (Hugh Grant) realizes that he doesn't either, although he's got enough money and a comfortable life. So he decides to change this... and the rest is history. Best line in the film is Will explaining to Marcus ""Look, I can't help you, leave me alone.... I can help you pick trainers or... music but I can't help you with anything that means anything!"" - hahaha - class!

Really good film that left me with something to think about: Do I have any 'back-up'?

7/10"
tt0276751,82,"About a Boy is probably one of the best films I've seen in recent years. At times funny, at times touching, it works throughout the entire movie.

So you wanna' know what it's about? There's this guy (played by Hugh Grant) who lives alone and has never had a real job because he lives off of the money his father made from a song that's been popular around Christmastime ever since. He meets this boy who has been having difficulty in school and whose mother is suicidal. Together, they discover that no man is an island, or rather every man is an island, except... ah, well, I'll leave that for the movie.

Seriously, though, this is one of my favorites of recent years. Go out immediately and watch it. Never have I seen a touching movie so funny, or a funny movie so touching. Worth every penny."
tt0276751,83,"Hugh Grant is a rich London lay-about who - through his pursuit of single mothers - finds himself in a relationship with a troubled teenager and her rather off-beat depressive mother.

Another Nic Hornby book adaptation and another Hugh Grant vehicle, which brings about a load of pro's as well as minuses to any project.

The author is actually a middle class, elite college (Cambridge) educated, ex-teacher pretending - for fashion purposes - to be a North London football roustabout complete with mock accent. So he must know a few things about living life as a fake.

While a fine writer, able to write well about small things, he is also light and throwaway. More like superior journalism than great novel writing, although always entertaining and down-to-earth.

Grant can't really act, merely do variations on himself. Here he is a bit more like the real person, no stumbling and bumbling and tripping over his own feet, but somewhat languid. While pleasant company he makes a lot of his nice face, foppish hair (here cut short and spiky) and upper class accent.

(Most English actors have come from the stage and have a range of tricks: while Grant has - somehow - grown up on film. Nearly always cast as himself.)

This is a film of small jokes and situation comedy. Running gags about the one song from which he lives (Santa's Magic Slay) and the empty tedium of his life abound, but I don't believe him. People don't volunteer to tell other people that they do nothing, they create professions (such as ""investor"") which they don't spend many hours doing. Equally the idle rich are not islands, they hang around with other members of the idle rich.

The film tries to not to go down the road of the obvious, the child who he befriends (or more accurately befriends him) is ordinary. If this was an American film the kid would be blonde haired and blue eyed, not so here. Naturally we are on a journey, if only towards fashion headgear and a better haircut.

Where is the Grant character on a journey to? That there is a life beyond daytime TV? Did he need to meet a child to learn that? Surely not. And where does the character go after this film ends? A slightly modified version of the same?

The film goes beyond the book in having a school concert in which Grant tries to save the day. Is this the best they could come up with? Character pieces are hard to end, but this is just an unpleasant pile-on-the-agony experience for everyone.

Overall, hard to dislike this film because everyone is working hard (and the music - from Badly Drawn Boy - is good too), but the sights are so low that it is barely a TV movie and I am not surprised they are making this in to a TV series. There is a lots of little jokes that could be rung and so many extra avenues they could wander down..."
tt0276751,84,"What can the directors of `American pie' possibly make out of the best selling novel that followed up Nick Hornby's `High fidelity'? A whole lot it seems. The two main characters Will (played by a Hugh Grant at his best) and Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) could not be more different: Will is a stylish, wealthy single in his thirties, who has never worked a single day and considers dating women his only purpose in his life. Marcus is a twelve year old vegetarian, who grows up with a single hippie mother and is constantly being teased by the other kids at school for being different. To Will's horror, their lives inevitably get entangled more and more from the moment they meet for the first time. Although Hornby recycles some of the ideas that made `High fidelity' so enjoyable to read and watch it is impossible for the viewer to predict the outcome of the fateful day when Marcus unintentionally kills a duck at the park while his mother, who is suffering from depression, tries to commit suicide. Had the directors refused the temptation to add the kitschy scene when Will rescues Marcus' embarrassing stage appearance at the school concert (which is not in the book), the film would bear no Hollywood clichés at all. All characters are perfectly credible and Hugh Grant manages to play his role without resemblance to the stereotypes he is so well known for. His performance is proof that it can be very hard to play light comedy with wit and charm and he handles the task perfectly. Young Nicholas Hoult also starrs brilliantly without making the mistake of depicting Marcus all too likeable. Although not as hilarious as the book, the film gets my recommendation for being a fine, unconventional satire. Self-centered singles should be warned though: This film is not only very entertaining, it could also shake your principles."
tt0276751,85,"one of hugh grants best movies.hugely enjoyable from start to finish,without being too predictable.toni colette just gets better with every movie she makes,i would love to see her in a starring role.why not a sequel to muriels wedding?"
tt0276751,86,"I can't help but feel that if this film had been directed by a British director with some understanding of real life in England it would have been a lot better.

The story/plot is basically OK, but for it to be believable, Marcus has to have some some character, some charisma, something more than being a pathetic token.

He has to have some sort of character to be latched onto by a wealthy waster like Will, for it to be believable.

In the film, Marcus is a stiflingly boring, stilted prop.

It didn't ring true with me at all, in any way.

I appreciate that it is a moral fable, but it is incredible when Marcus gets a crush on a badly acted post punk wannabee, and she takes to him and becomes his girlfriend. This just makes no sense at all. It isn't real life folks.

And then the concert...

What happens when Marcus goes back to school the next week?

Will he be the new hero, or the former target of abuse.

Place your bets.

(Ignoring the ""bolt on"" happy ending of the film)

Uplifting it may try to be, but I was left depressed by the glib, patronising, moralising vacuousness of it all.

Loved ""Hi-Fidelity"", but was completely unimpressed by this.

Cheers, Will"
tt0276751,87,"I did honestly just watch the movie to witness another of Hugh Grant's epic performances (note: sarcasm) But honestly found myself enjoying this film. Although I've said I thought the book was better; I did very much appreciate the integrity of the film and how it shows the difficulty that children go through at school to find social acceptance. (I know that this wasn't the main plot fo teh movie but i liked it) In my opinion i would rate this as a seven, it was good but not as good as it could have been."
tt0276751,88,"I thought the film 'About a Boy' was excellent. I really enjoyed it. It was the first film i have seen with Hugh Grant in it. I have also seen Hugh Grant in 'Bridget Jones' Diary' which was really good. I thought he was really good in it. I also liked it because Toni Collette was in it and I have seen her in 'Muriel's Wedding', which was also very good. I thought that 'About a Boy' was a really good film and i would recommend that anyone anyone to see it. Apart from under 12's. Because it is a 12. It had all kinds of expressions and feelings in it. Things like romance, comedy, emotion, which was what made the film more interesting to watch. I would really like to read the book as well.

tt0276751,89,"Between this and _High Fidelity_, I think I need to read Nick Hornby's novels!

This is a delightful (even though I hate that word) story, with excellent performances by everyone including the one playing Marcus. I'm not sure he'll go places like Haley Joel Ozment -- whom he compares himself to early on -- but by the end of the film, once his hair style gains attitude, he's a good enough looking kid, and a good actor.

Hugh Grant does a terrific job being a not-nice-but-not-bastardly-guy -- will he be nominated for an Oscar? Well, just a few more weeks will tell, but he really did well in this.

Rachel Weisz (sp?) puts on a posh London accent as flawlessly as did Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones's Diary (which also featured Hugh Grant in a bastardly role -- hmmm, makes one think ...), although it's a bit hard to believe her as the mother of a 12-year-old -- but that's me, father of a pair of five year olds at age 43! She just seems too bloody young.

Overall, a terrific use of an hour and forty-odd minutes -- and you'd never believe the pair who directed _American Pie_ directed this one!"
tt0276751,90,"This script seems made for Hugh Grant, and is that rare find: a feel-good movie that isn't trite or cliched. Our hero, Will, is a self-centered man who seems happy yet is unfulfilled, though it takes him a while to realize that. The lesson is taught by Marcus, remarkably portrayed by newbie Nicholas Hoult, a boy who happens into Will's life. Additional credit goes to the lovable Rachel Weisz, of the Mummy movies and others, who does a good job of looking desirable, about all the script demands of her, and Toni Colette is perfect as Fiona, the boy's granola-crunching mother. But the real stars are the Weitz brothers, who take a story about real emotions, keep it light and enjoyable, and still provide a decent message. It's the kind of movie most parents could watch with their ten or twelve year old children. I give this movie an eight overall, ably done from every standpoint: writing, direction, and acting."
tt0276751,91,"This is in response to another user's comments on this movie.

I thought Nicholas Hoult was marvelous in this movie. He was my favorite thing about it, really. He can't sing? Well, maybe not. But that was hardly the point. The point, in fact, was that his character COULDN'T sing. You obviously didn't get it.

I do, however, agree that Hugh Grant needs to diversify his roles a bit more. I must admit, though, that I didn't detest him as much in this movie as I normally do.

I liked the book (loved High Fidelity much more) but this is one of the few occurences where I actually preferred the movie."
tt0276751,92,"Hugh Grant, with 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' has made romantic comedy his own genre. This movie focuses on Will's relationship with a young boy, Marcus, and the romantic interest is peripheral. Nonetheless it retains more than enough of the formulaic elements of the Hugh Grant genre to retain interest. But that's all! This movie lacks the lustre of the earlier movies, and in places, seems tired, despite Grant's undeniable charm."
tt0276751,93,"This is one great movie!! After I had seen it a friend who had yet to see it asked whether Hugh Grant gets Rachel Weisz in the end. I wouldn't tell him because that was entirely besides the point. What the story was about was how we all need to relate to others. And here we have a guy who appears to have everything but in reality has nothing befriending a young boy who appears to have nothing and yet really knows what life is about. Who learns the most from whom is the point of this great modern day morality tale.

For true classic comedy scenes I can't think of anything that beats Hugh Grant rushing to his young friend's assistance when he is about to humiliate himself by singing Killing Me Softly at the school rock concert. Can Hugh save the day????? Maybe not but 10 out of 10 for a masterpiece of comic timing.. See this movie.. You won't regret it!!"
tt0276751,94,"Wonderful movie, and a great new presentation of High Grant! Hitherto, Grant's performances have been fine--- but always a bit theatrical ( but-- DUH-- we see him in a movie THEATER, so that's OK!). I never had the sense that his characters were anyone I'd ever actually meet, or even want to meet, particularly. This movie, however, kind of like last year's ""Diary of Whosis,"" may be signaling a departure for this actor. The character he plays here is actually someone I'd like to know (not literally, not the actor, but the vibe, the kind of person). I really enjoyed and admired this new Hugh Grant (note that the Bridget Jones' ""New Hugh Grant,"" while different from the old bumbler, wasn't as folksy-friendly-admirable-likeable as this character).

Rachel Weisz is a total babe, and Toni Collete played the PERFECT hippie lady. I KNOW her!!! (You know what I mean). I know dozens of old hippie ladies EXACTLY like Collete's character, and her whole scene. And this whole scene wasn't presented as satire, or for laughs. The writers/directors seemed to have genuine respect and affection for those folks (and they see, in a kindly way, the inherent humor in their anachronistic nerdiness, too).

Please don't make me say it--- OK, I'll say it: This movie is heart-warming. It MEANS something. I LOVE this movie. It is a definite ""10"" out of ""10."""
tt0276751,95,"'About A Boy' is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Hugh Grant did a great job, he is terrific. I gave it only 9 out of ten is because Rachel Weisz only plays a smallish role, or I'll give it full marks! But she is great, though!"
tt0276751,96,"*About A Boy*

I just got back from seeing About a Boy, and I am happy to say it was an enjoying experience. It was hillarious and heart-warming at the saem time. It had witty dialouge and likeable charactors.

It follows the story of shallow yuppie Will (Grant). He's basicly just the regular sometimes cliched selfish man until he meets Marcus (Hoult), a young quiet young boy. Marcus isn't popular at school and doesn't really have any friends other than his mom, Fiona (Collette). After a lot of scamming and lying to women, Will finally starts realizing what a cynical jerk he is, with the help of Marcus. The funny thing about thier situation is the happier Marcus gets (once he gets friends and recognition, with the help of Will) the more depressed Will gets. In the end they need to help each other to all be happy.

The acting is delightful. Grant gives the performance of his lifetime (sorry to say it doesn't mean much). Toni Collette is fabulous (is she really British?). And Hoult is also good (was he wearing lipstick?). All in all this movie is charming and funny. I would recomend it to anyone with a heart and sense of humor.

*7.5/10*"
tt0276751,97,"This is an incredibly clever, witty little film, with Hugh Grant playing a role I've never seen him in. I'm not a big Hugh Grant fan and I was convinced that this was probably the ideal role for him, a single guy doesn't want to commit, wanders around aimlessly looking for single mothers to shag, however, the usual gestures and expressions that Hugh is so fond of using in his acting, no matter what the character, weren't as noticeable, leaving me to wonder if he's allowed himself to act without his safety net. If this is the case, then well done. At several points, I almost forgot that this was Hugh Grant, he allowed himself to look older, less charming, human, and it worked. But that's enough about him. The movie itself moved with a gentle pace, not so slow as to bore you and not so fast as to lose you, and I found myself entertained throughout. I've never read the book for which this movie is based, but perhaps I should, then maybe I'd understand the opposite sex a little better. `A man is an island' is the theme throughout and it couldn't be more wrong.

Nicholas Hoult as Marcus steals the show from Grant, in my book, as the strange son of Toni Collette, who worked marvels with the character she was given, but she's always been one of my favorites since Muriel's Wedding. If you haven't seen it, you should. I'm a huge fan of Bridget Jones's Diary and I have to say that this really is the man's version."
tt0276751,98,
tt0276751,99,"This film is superb in more ways than one. It not only manages to combine humour with a terrific storyline but also brings great performances from all the talent involved. I was lucky enough to go to the premiere in Leicester Square, and afterwards met some of the stars. This film is highly appropriate for any fan of Bridget Jones, Four Weddings and Notting Hill. The film unlike many comedies is not a series of set pieces and works as a good plotline in its own right, without the comedy value. Nick Hoult is tremendous in the role of Marcus the son of a modern hippy who forces her son to adopt her worldly ideals (and clothing). Hugh Grant is just his average self, neverending tense moments, huge amounts of lies to women, just continuous humour throughout the film. He is an institution! Performances from Toni Collette with abundant amusement surrounding her throughout, and Rachel Weisz both create great support efforts. Overall this film sticks together and does not have loose scenes but is a thoroughly adorable film."
tt0276751,100,"About a Boy featured several excellent actors and actresses - well, they did a good job with *this* film anyway. However, as a story, it was nothing special or original. It's not the typical romantic comedy; it is romantic comedy with a twist. Hugh Grant's character is too immature, and the little boy is too mature at the point where he is 'uncool' and bullied at school. An unlikely relationship is formed between the two, and as a result, both characters become stronger with less flaws. Of course, their relationships have their problems, but they all grow and become better people. Like many films in this genre, it has a happy ending.

Hugh is great with a widespread range of emotions, the plot and pacing tight, the energy, the depth of feelings pure adrenaline. This is a great family movie with a no non-sense style that hits home about the meaning of life, about being different, and about a boy and a man along with the people in their lives. I'd watch this over Star Wars, over Spider-Man because this movie is about substance from the heart as well as the mind."
tt0276751,105,"A charming nice little film which will enlighten your evening. About a Boy is not a daring film, but it is immensely likable. Every once in a while, a movie comes along that, despite traversing familiar terrain, is made with enough all-around skill that it overcomes its clichéd origins. About a Boy is such a movie. In a summer when pyrotechnics, superheroes, sequels, and mindless action are sure to rule, this film gives us a feel-good human story to savor between bursts of testosterone and adrenaline. Both Nicholas Hoult and Hugh Grant are very good but Toni Collete- who is a fine actor- steals the show. Her delivery is impeccable. This is a great watch."
tt0276751,106,Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hult steal the film ss playing a 38 year old man who befriends a 12 year old boy. I love the friendship between them. I also love the performances feom every other character. This is a must see. 😁👍🏾

tt0276751,108,"Amazing, feel good movie for relaxing time. And Grant's narration voice is the best part of movie. I mean if he was my dad I would make him read badtime stories to me every evening."
tt0276751,109,"I had been meaning to watch this film from start to finish for sometime now and finally this evening an opportunity presented itself.

Having caught snippets of 'about a boy' over the last decade or so, the snippets were enough to bring me back for a full showing.

I can't disagree with the bulk of reviews here. The storyline is brutally honest, believable and at times quirky. That coupled with superb performances from Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult some great 'Londoncentric' cinematography make for a terrific film."
tt0276751,110,"Will Freeman is the ultimate slacker. Living off the royalties of his one-hit-wonder father's Christmastime jingle Will is proud of never having had a job or, indeed, having done much of anything. He's not interested in a serious relationship - casual sex and one-night stands are his forté. Then, one day he ventures into a single parents' group meeting. Soon, he is dating a woman who is babysitting for her friend's son, Marcus.This wouldn't mean much to Will, except that Marcus takes a liking to him and decides that Will might be the perfect match for his emotionally disturbed mother, Fiona (Toni Collette). Then the strangest thing happens - Will and Marcus strike up an unusual friendship. But complications ensue when Will falls for another single mother (Rachel Weisz) and wants Marcus to pretend to be his son. This is a hilarious drama from England and you should check it out."
tt0276751,111,Awkward characters in a movie that tries to treat serious issues light-heartedly. But it doesn't succeed. It left me feeling as empty as the main character's empty life. It depends too much on annoying voice-over narration (by both main characters!). Why do you feel you're being manipulated? And this contrived pulling of heart-strings isn't convincing because much of it is explained through... voice-over! Music is forgettable too. Great cast though that throw their all into it. Wished I could have liked it more for that reason.
tt0276751,112,"A normal chick flick involves a guy falling in love with a girl. It ends with them living happily ever after. In this movie, the protagonist isn't interested in having a relationship. But sometimes, life takes unexpected turns. He befriends a boy who teaches him a lot about life. This movie is hilarious and the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and the boy is brilliant. Definitely worth a watch!"
tt0276751,113,"About a Boy finds an excellent balance between being a lighthearted comedy and a thought-provoking drama. It starts out looking like a run-of-the-mill rom-com, but it soon reveals itself as a captivating story with complex characters. Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette work very well together. This is a great movie."

""Growing up has nothing to do with age.""

During attempts to meet available women, a shallow, irresponsible bachelor (Grant) reluctantly strikes up a friendship with the unhappy, misfit son (Hoult) of an eccentric, suicidal hippie (Collette), which is jeopardised when he unexpectedly falls in love.

Not your typical British romcom, as the important relationship here is between man and boy, and what they learn from (and teach) one another, with a never-better Grant clearly relishing his newly-nurtured caddish ways first demonstrated in BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY.

Collette also shines in a difficult role that could have been played unsympathetically, while the dual narration works well in this excellent, largely faithful (except for the ending) adaptation of Hornby's 1998 novel.

Blu-ray Extras: None. ½ (1/10)"
tt0276751,115,"""About A Boy"" ""About A Boy"" (2002) is a professionally produced comedic drama about looking inside. The story is about a womanizer, who has never worked a day in his life, Will Freeman played by Hugh Grant, that meets a down on his luck boy, Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult, and discovers a surprising connection that could change the course of their lives. This film is awkwardly hilarious and towards the end of the film, Marcus delivers a line to Will that should make every human take a step back and evaluate their own life.

This movie seamlessly intertwines two stories in this film. The main being from Will's point of view and the second is about Marcus and his mother, Fiona played by Toni Collette, as they deal with his mother's depression and being bullied at school. Though the film doesn't have anything I can specifically relate to, it does have moments of emotional impact that will stay with me. The strength that Marcus displays as he makes conscious efforts to force Will to become a part of his family was odd, but powerful. I found it odd because a young boy going to an adult's house without their parent's knowledge or permission is unsafe and unheard of for modern times. Overall, this fill had drama, comedy, and a sliver of romance that I find highly entertaining"
tt0276751,116,
tt0276751,117,"'About a Boy' is one of those films that always appears to be showing somewhere. Probably because of its appeal to a family audience who can all enjoy the story and light humour.

For me, the best part of this film is the exceptional performances from Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult, who play Will and Marcus respectively. The relationship between the pair and the funny moments they deliver is what makes the film.

The storyline is relatively simple and easy to follow but still manages to be enjoyable and interesting. Whilst this isn't a film I particularly like, I could happily sit though it again and again without getting bored."
tt0276751,118,"As far as Will Freeman (Grant) is concerned, he has the perfect life; he lives comfortably, if not extravagantly, on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance. On the surface, at least, he's happy. Admittedly, however, he's the very epitome of 'shallow,' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships, or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all. He merely takes from life, gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it. But of late, his relationships have become a bit 'sticky.' Women are becoming too demanding, the break-ups too messy. He needs a new conquest, a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew, with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return.

Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for; fortuitous, however, in a way he doesn't realize, as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life, as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective. For the first time, Will begins to question who he is, and what he's doing-- or not doing-- with his life.

Telling this story (adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, from the novel by Nick Hornby) presented a challenge to the filmmakers, in that it's nothing really new; the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies, many along the same lines as this one (recently, 'The Kid,' with Bruce Willis, for example). So a fresh approach and presentation, including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors, was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever. Which it does, and splendidly. And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts. The screenplay is intelligent, and the characters-- especially Will and Marcus' mom, Fiona (Toni Collette)-- are convincingly well developed. With Will, there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film; it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is, after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow. The same is true of Fiona. There's detours and set-backs which-- as in real life-- prevent a direct journey from point A to point B, and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way. Weitz and Weitz set a good pace, and most importantly, manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic, maudlin sentimentality. Rather, the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable, and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.

As Will, Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever. In some respects, Will is similar to other characters Grant has created (most notably Daniel in 'Bridget Jones's Diary'), but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve, and without question this is his most three-dimensional, fully developed character yet. Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence, but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here. He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms, and by the end, it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before; with this role, he has effectively expanded his range as an actor. In the final analysis, it's a performance with real substance, and it makes Will a truly memorable character."
tt0276751,119,"As a kid, I always saw TV premiers for the film ""About a Boy"" on channel ten and I was very excited every time it can on, too bad I had to go to bed at those times, never getting to actually see a glimpse of the film. After all these years, I end up seeing the film two days. This was definitely not the wait and I don't believe on how long I actually had to wait to see this film. This is one of the most marvelous comedy dramas I have ever seen in such a long time.

The story follows a lonesome young man who doesn't have a job, stays home and watches TV all day and basically chills out. It's not until he joins a ""single parents group"" and then meets little Marcus that his life slowly starts to change into something that he has never experienced before. This boy teaches him how to be a ""mature being"".

I really enjoyed everything about this intriguing film. By the ending title credits, I was totally hooked and my eyes never took away from the screen. The actors were beautifully produced and developed, the story is an excellent scent to get into and there are many comedic scenes which will have you laughing.

Hugh Grant is obviously the main star of this film and for good reason. He does an excellent job of adapting this role of Will, the selfish but isolated man who just wants to be left alone, and wants to live his life alone. I really had sympathy for the character because I knew what he was going through. I'm sure everyone in real life has experienced some of the traumas that the Will Character goes through. You really love him even if he can get picky in many areas. I could really relate to him myself in some ways. Hugh Grant of course brings this character to life. It's not only with the character's mood and the atmosphere of him but it's the comic relief and comedic dialogue which makes him come to life fully.

The boy who plays as the young, lost little soul Marcus, was also quite a powerful figure throughout this film. We too also feel sorry for him as he has a hard time living at home, getting bullied and only having Will to look up to. Even though he is harmless in every way possible, it doesn't stop him from wanting to help Will in the best way possible to succeed and not be held back by isolation. The boy too doesn't have any friends and is treated badly but Will seems to be a build up of an excellence for him. The two have each other to bounce off of. But it is the boy which works on Will more with emotions and life itself because the boy helps Will to change his view on life. Will alter realizes that Marcus is the only person he has really gottan to love. This creates a semi-father son hood. It also has many funny results as some things don't go the way Will plans it.

The back up actors and sound track score are also an excellent back up throughout. The story is also well scripted.

The film receives: 9/10"

tt0276751,122,"Will (Hugh Grant) is a little over the middle age bachelor. Surprisingly he doesn't have a job or never had one for too long, but doing quite well off with a steady income thanks to his father. As he calls himself he is an 'Island'. Living alone in an apartment with his own little positive attitude towards it, Will fails to have a steady relationship what so ever. Until this 12 year old boy he meets up while trying to get attention from single mothers. Soon he finds interest in this boy and amidst all the issue the boy has at home they become close to each other. And then Will realizes that life has much more than just living alone with random dates to accompany him and his big CD collection.

Coming from a Nick Hornby's best-selling novel, the script of this flick is totally entertaining. Moving back and forth from the thoughts inside Will's head and to things what actually happens around him gives an exposure of what Will's life and expectations are all about. Though he is a 'self centered ignorant bastard' he does have some thoughts of being more communicative or trying to help the people around him. But that though soon disappear and he finds himself in the same old selfish place.

Hugh Grant does a good job on his role of portraying Will. Will is charming, smooth and uses his words carefully. And when it's the time to slip away he just does that without hesitating.

From an adults point of view sometimes the kid will annoy you. But then he is just a kid and life is not the same for kids as adults. Especially when he got a suicidal mom! And while this kid is craving for attention, Will the totally opposite tries to hide away in his own agenda. The whole plot is just about every emotion which is involved in this struggle.

'About a Boy' is a good movie. It's a drama yet has good humor in it. Good flow, good music and good acting. Ends well and leaves you with a good spirit! More of my reviews at flickshout.tk"
tt0276751,123,"About A Boy is one of Hugh Grant's finest - in it, he plays a ne'er do well rich 38 year old boy who invents an imaginary son to attend single parent groups to hook up with women. Along the way he meets up with a 12 year old who shows him how to be a grown up. Grant is at his most charming and the movie is very subdued. Toni Colette plays the young boys mom and Rachel Weisz is the vexing older girl for Marcus. It is this relationship in the movie that brings smiles to the viewer. In the end, Will helps Marcus be a cool kid, and Marcus helps Will mature and be a grown up. The pairing of the two plays perfectly. One wishes Hugh Grant would go back to making these kind of little charming pictures"
tt0276751,124,"It has always been a big issue, making a movie about a book, sometimes is a big success (hairy potter) but in this case it wasn't. I liked the book very much, the funny and realistic thoughts, the good story and the really outstanding writing-skills. at first, the storyline was way more realistic and good chosen, in the movie it's predictable and it's different from the book, so much that the summary's of both really don't look the same, only the main thought of the novel/movie is coming trough, which I think is also better in the book. and why did Marcus did the school talentshow in the movie, it did have something to do with the story but it didn't make any sense because Will did things which weren't realistic, so is this a good of the movie."

tt0276751,127,"The film about a boy is a good film. It has the right actors, good settings and great dialogs sometimes. Of course there are film better than this one, but i don't want to talk about that. What I want to do is comparing the film and the book. The film fits good to the book. Many aspects from the book are processed in the film. If you've read the book, you see comparisons. The book is more extensive but you can imagine a picture for your own, the film on the other hand doesn't explain much besides the theme of the story.

So i would recommend the book if I have to choose. But the fact remains, the film is also very good, if you only see the film you also have a complete picture of the story."
tt0276751,128,"I thought the novel of About a Boy was quite good, but the film is totally different from it. I didn't like it that much, because it rushed through things so fast I couldn't understand some things the first time. In the novel Nirvana and Kurt Cobain play a pretty big role and in the film it barely gets mentioned. The ending is also different and the performance of Marcus, which is I think the most important part of the movie, doesn't even exist in the novel. The characters in the movie are well acted and sometimes funny. I think the novel is better than the movie, because it goes more into detail and explains things a lot better. But they both have their own things and that is also nice."
tt0276751,129,"About a boy goes about Will, an cool, modern and hip adult and about Marcus, a little, friendless, weird child. In the beginning of the book you get to know them very well and finally they get to know each other and they help each other to grow up.

The beginning of the movie and the book are quiet the same, but at the end you will see a lot of differences. Par example Marcus wears glasses in the book, but he didn't in the movie. Also his behavior changes much in the book, but in the movie it isn't that much changed. The biggest difference is the end. In the book Marcus first is a witness of an accident, with Ellie who broke the window, than he went to his father and at the end Will makes sure he's alright. Ellie has a bigger role in the book than in the movie. In the movie Marcus did a performance at school in front of everybody, because of his mother, Will wanted to stop him, what didn't work and finally Will ends on stage with a guitar in his hands. The movie ends with Christmas, where they are all together as one family.

I liked the book better than the movie, because the book is more in detail and you are the person who can use your fantasy. So I'd recommend the book above the movie."

tt0276751,133,"I think the film is better, because the novel continue to long about one subject. In the film they talk about a subject, but not too long. Because they talk long about one subject, it becomes sometimes a little bit boring. In the novel it's difficult to represent the characters. They don't say how they look like. So it make it difficult to read, because you can represent them. I won't say that it's a bad book, but there are disadvantages. So that's about the book. The film is good, because there are subjects that are realistic. For example the mother of Marcus Fiona tries to commit suicide and Marcus is bullied on school. That subjects are realistic, because they often happen in real. But the book is realistic, too. In the film they don't talk too much about one subject. They talk enough about one subject, but not too much. So my conclusion is that the novel is good, but film is better and that is because the film don't talk too much about one subject and the novel does. I think everyone must see this film and read the book"

tt0276751,135,"About a Boy

About a Boy is a touching, warm story about actually two boys, both struggling with their own problems. Will is a lonely 38-year old man, living of the money of his father and actually doing nothing all day long. And then there is Marcus, a 12-year old boy with a crazy mother, who gets bullied and has not a very nice life. When they meet, Will is irritated on Marcus. But when Marcus keeps on visiting him every day, uninvited, Will starts to care about him. They try to help each other with their problems. About a Boy is a very intriguing story and you completely get sucked into it. You just want to know how Will and Marcus will end up. Will they ever be happy? I recommend the film (and the book) to everyone. I am sure that not only females will like this, but also guys will find this film very nice. It is for every age and everyone who watches it, will want to watch it again. Really, you should see it!"
tt0276751,136,"A few weeks ago I started to read this book, first it was quite hard because of the two different stories. But when I had finished it I was kind of surprised because I actually liked the story. Most of the times I don't really like the film after reading a book first, and this time it wasn't different. You have a picture in your head, and when you see the film you get kind of disappointed by seeing all these pictures you didn't really have in mind, especially with the main characters. In my head Marcus looked so much different than in the film. But the film on its own was quite good, I loved the actors they were really amazing. But compared with the book I was still kind of disappointed about the story, because of the Nirvana aspect. In the book it's really an important subject, and that actually gives the story some character, in my opinion. In the film they actually doesn't even mention Nirvana, or everything around it. So, I like the book better, but the film is still really good!"
tt0276751,137,"My first opinions about the book were, before I saw the film, that I would be quiet a good film, because I had already red some other reviews, and they were mostly positive. I read the book in about 3 or 4 days, which is reasonable fast. I've to admit the it didn't read that fast because the story was so interesting to me ,but just because it was easy to read and not unpredictable. However, my expectations before seeing the movie were quit high. Some things I didn't liked about the story, was that there were very few serious events during the book, which made I quit hard to read. Also i didn't like the difference between the story line of the book compared to the story line of the film, because at the ending of the film the film takes a different turn. However overall, I think the director of the film did a pretty good job, by ripping out the boring bits of the book, and replace them by more interesting events, like the school performance at the end of the film."
tt0276751,138,"I've watched the film and read the book. I like films rather than books. This film was a story that was fun to watch. I liked the way of playing. The book was a bit strange. I don't have a fantasy to create my own vision of the story. With a film I can. The film is more funny and the book is a lot of serious stuff. In the book there were parts that didn't exists in the film. Like the Christmas evening. When Marcus got a CD and a CD-player when in the book he only got a CD. I don't understand why this small thing is different in the book but it is. Also the characters of the film are chosen good. They played their role better than the characters in the book. Marcus was the smart little guy, Will was the enthusiastic, a bit strange and friendly person and Fiona the desperate mother who was always crying. I liked the film very much. But the book wasn't interesting."
tt0276751,139,"I've watched the movie and I've read the book, and there are a lot of differences between those two. For example, in the movie there is sort of a rock concert going on in Marcus's school, but in the book there is nothing what refers to a rock concert or something like that. Also a difference is that Nirvana is playing a big role in the book, but in the film there is no Nirvana at all, which a think is a pity. The biggest difference is the end I guess. The end in the book is totally different from the end of the film. The end of the film is a happy end, eventually everything is fine. Marcus is happy and has friends, Will has a relationship with Rachel and Marcus's mum seems to fall in love with a weird friend of Will. In the book the end is totally different. In the movie they also skip a whole part, the part where Marcus and Ellie go to Cambridge to visit Marcus's dad. I both like the film and the book, but if I have to make I choice, I like the book better because everything is comprehensively explained."

Important parts in the book don't appear in the movie. Like the part where you meet Marcus' father, Clive. He has got an important role in the book, but doesn't appear in the movie. I think it not good if you cut out an important role. The ending in the book is also different from the movie. I prefer the ending of the book, because everything becomes clearer in the book than in the movie. Nick writes how Marcus became so cool and how Will became serious.

I hardly laugh, let alone laugh out loud, while watching films, but this movie had many moments that made me do just that.

The dialogue on this movie is just as brilliant as the acting, as well as the storyline.

Hugh Grant has delivered again. This and Love Actually have been real hits for me.

This is a film you could watch after a tough day or on a Friday night just to relax.

Won't let you down, go watch it!"
tt0276751,146,"Shallow London bachelor Hugh Grant (as Will Freeman) doesn't need to work for a living as he lives comfortably off the residuals inherited from his father's 1958 Christmas hit ""Santa's Super Sleigh"" and spends his time looking for short-term sexual relationships with attractive women. After a successful fling with a single mother, Mr. Grant decides to set aside his disdain for children and court more lonely young mothers. He invents a son named ""Ned"" goes to an event for single parents.

Already good-looking and well-heeled, Grant's invented fatherhood gives him the character needed to be a triple player. On a date, he meets geeky twelve-year-old Nicholas Hoult (as Marcus Brewer). Young Hoult needs a mate to help watch his mum, Toni Collette (as Fiona), who has an occasional tendency to sob and get suicidal. Grant isn't interested in shagging the kid's ""hippie"" mother, but is blackmailed into being a father-figure for Hoult, who has discovered Grant's secret (he has no kid). Eventually, Grant asks Hoult to pose as his son, hoping to score with comely Rachel Weisz (as Rachel).

""About a Boy"" is a pleasant surprise, mostly due to the casting of Hoult, a complete natural, in the pivotal role; he not the annoying movie star kid you're expecting. The film also flatters Grant and its cast, with only Ms. Collette's character being slightly underwritten - we aren't given enough information about her condition, but the actress and story suggest she's going to be okay in the long run. The two supporting youth roles, Natalia Tena and Augustus Prew, are also nicely played.

All kidding asides  Paul and Chris Weitz were known more for producing the low-brow ""American Pie"" franchise  which had nothing to do with the 1972 ""American Pie"" hit single  but ""About a Boy"" very effectively uses the Roberta Flack classic ""Killing Me Softly with His Song""  which was originally written about ""American Pie"" singer/songwriter Don McLean  and became a mega-cool ""hip-hop"" hit by The Fugees in 1996 ... connections which are not ""Badly Drawn, Boy""  yes it was John Donne, not Bon Jovi, who said ""No man is an island""  but Paul Kantner added ""He's a peninsula!""

The co-directing Weisz brothers, with writer Peter Hedges, do a beautiful job translating the Nick Hornby novel to cinema. It's nice to see filmmakers are still able to make refreshing changes to excellent source material. As the DVD describes, this is a ""lesson about life from a bright, but hopelessly geeky 12-year-old named Marcus"" taught to a ""smooth-talking bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility,"" with both ""boys"" benefiting in the end.

******** About a Boy (4/26/02) Paul & Chris Weitz ~ Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz"
tt0276751,147,"Hugh Grant shows just how winning he can be, and how he's managed such longevity in his career despite being a fairly limited actor, in this disarming and delightful film.

With a title like ""About a Boy,"" you just know going in that there will be some question as to which ""boy"" we're talking about. This film belongs to the long line of movies about childish adults who learn how to be more mature from children who are more adult than they are, but it feels original and like a story worth telling, even if it's been told before.

Toni Collette is terrific, as usual, as the mom of the boy and girlfriend of the ""boy,"" and adds yet one more captivating performance to her impressive resume.

Grade: A-"
tt0276751,148,"No man is an island -- but no film is either. The proverbial happy bachelor who is set in his ways is bound to succumb to the temptations of togetherness and love as he does in every film. ""About a Boy"" does not defy this classic character profile, but neither does it slosh around in clichéd fashion. Hugh Grant's charms and his surrounding cast of unusuals played by fine actors add just enough color to Nick Hornby's touching family story to appear fresh and even revelatory.

Grant plays Will, a ladies' man living off royalties from his father's one hit Christmas song who decides to up his game by pretending to be a single parent and going after lonely, confused single moms. This leads him by a stroke of fate to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a pre- pubescent boy whose mother attempts suicide their very first day acquainted with each other. Marcus has surprising amount of self-determination for his age and Hoult gives him maturity beyond his years. Before long (but not without some persistence from Marcus), the two form an odd friendship. Marcus needs a distraction from his emotionally shaky home life and Will find unintentionally that Marcus gives him some purpose and direction.

The two will redefine relationships for anyone viewing this film. The proper classification for them would be ambiguous. Will is a father figure to Marcus, but he's also the closest thing Marcus has to a friend as the kids at school have shunned him socially because he's odd, small and breaks out into song unbeknownst to himself on occasion. That said, Will doesn't do any actual things for Marcus, but his presence and attention does wonders.

Will's destiny is set from here on out. It's only a matter to what extent he will discover the need for human connection in life, or as Marcus puts in in voice over, having more than just one other person. The script poignantly explores the notion of fulfilling self needs versus fulfilling those of others, while also carefully pointing out that these needs are intricately interconnected.

The film is an impressive departure for brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who co-wrote ""The Nutty Professor II"" and directed ""American Pie."" Teamed with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" scribe Peter Hedges, the adaptation takes shape nicely. Perhaps they're light on building Grant's character into a truly independent person, but it's easier to like him this way. Better he not be a jerk, which would hurt the plausibility of Marcus looking up to him.

As is true of Hornby's work, music is central, and it's especially prominent in ""Boy."" The key turning point revolved around a performance of Roberta Flack's ""Killing Me Softly"" and the soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy creates a distinct mood. The power of song as self- expression is equally important, as music creates connections between people that are intangible.

tt0276751,150,"Not bad but not good either. It makes you spend about 2 hours in a good mood watching the story of two lives that cross each other at a certain moment: an idle 38 year old man (done by Hugh Grant who is not a great actor, with all his stereotyped facial expressions) and a 12 year old clever and sensible boy (done marvelously by Nicholas Hoult). The boy lives with his divorced mother who suffers from cyclic depressions with suicide attempts and has an odd behavior being (and making her son to be) a vegetarian and having the boy to wear odd clothes and using a hair-do which makes him not very popular at school and the object of bullying by his classmates. The man lives alone and besides watching TV and running about after women does practically nothing since he lives on money that comes from an author's copyright his father got for having composed a song who turned out to be famous. The story goes on smoothly with lots of lies people tell each other, with no particular aim, with the boy meeting the man regularly at the former's home with no other purpose than to fulfill his unhappy life while the man finishes by attaching himself sentimentally to the boy. After reading this one could think that we are before some kind of drama. Not at all. This is a comedy because the situations created are intended to make you laugh and sometimes you do laugh indeed at certain scenes. But in the whole you don't laugh as much as you were supposed too because the story hasn't great funny moments. An almost good movie but just only almost after all."
tt0276751,151,"As another reviewer stated, Hugh Grant is quite funny here. And Rachel Weisz is beautiful and inspiring as always too. But the principal story line didn't really work for me, as it was/is supposed to. While it's obvious that the movie has a boy in it (clue is in the title), it also is clear, that this boy will affect our main character (nothing that hasn't happened in other movies before or will happen in feature movies with a similar story).

While a more recent effort has Dwayne Johnson (aka the Rock) in a similar role, this effort with Hugh Grant, tries to stay more/closer to reality. While some might find this very attractive, some others would've loved it to be more comedic. I personally thought, that it wasn't funny enough, but actually liked the first steps. Not trying to fit the bill, trying to escape the blue-print of this movies. Unfortunately in my eyes it isn't really good, but not bad either. Just a nice movie"

tt0276751,154,"Middle aged bachelor Will (Grant) gets more than he bargained for when he meets Malcolm (Hoult) a young lad who wants a partner for his suicidal mum.

Hugh Grant, the romantic guy of the nineties. You may ask what makes About a Boy different from every other romance films. Why should you spend time watching a film that could easily be a repeat of another one of his flicks? With his roles in films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, his characters were always chasing the girl but there is more to Will than these stereotypical parts. He is not Prince Charming. He is not a babbling geek. He is a git. A man with no regard for anything but himself. Grant has made Will the man any viewer would love to hate.

But yet he manages to be unbelievably funny and charming, and you can't help but love him. Grant here has shed that everyday lovable loser who can't commit into a man with personal baggage and an agenda. Juxtaposed with Nicholas Holt and you have a fine on screen duo.

Little would we know that the lad playing Malcolm would become a teenage hero in award winning teenage gritty drama Skins. This well thought out debut performance puts faith back into the future.

The stereotypical geek protagonist is ridiculed too often by picking up on media conventions such as computers, glasses and vast knowledge etc. But there is a spin here because Malcolm is called a geek because of his appearance. The baggy hippy clothes, the bowl haircut and the solo singing make him an outcast and he is labelled a geek for it and here we explore the depths of his character and though he is portrayed as a geek on the outside he is a child wanting love on his inside, a fine representation. This sentimental technique which some may find obvious but undeniably rightful.

Sounds cheesy right? Wrong. This Nick Hornby adaptation is far from it. Unpredictable, consistent, funny and without resorting to clichés and slapstick humour creates a sharp originality. The script also preaches through strong real life issues including growing up, suicide, bullying and loneliness. About a Boy is not afraid to get its messages across.

Though Grant and Hoult are the stand out stars, Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) gives a knockout supporting role as Malcolm's mother.

About a Boy is a fine real romantic drama that preaches through hidden messages and delivers through some stand out performances."
tt0276751,155,
tt0276751,156,"Toni Collette is the best part of the picture, portraying a completely 4-dimensional role as someone with chronic, severe depression. Unfortunately, the word ""depression"" or ""illness"" is never used in the picture, so people watching it may not understand what her problem is.

Hugh Grant plays yet another version of Hugh Grant (always dependable) and does a great job at one point of removing all signs of intelligence from his face and eyes -- truly going ""blank.""

This rom-com-drama is one of a long series from England (often starring Hugh Grant) beginning with Four Weddings & A Funeral, where personal relationships are placed in the greater context of family and friends. The core story is predictable, so you're left with the quirks to determine whether this will be memorable or not.

About A Boy is memorable due to its handling of some of the more ""deep"" themes -- it doesn't get too maudlin and doesn't gloss over them too much, either. It allows the viewer to take it further if they want, but keeps it to a consistent degree of intensity for those who just want to see Grant be Grant.

There are few surprises (though the ones that pop up can be shockers) and ultimately it's a predictable picture, but it's definitely a cut above average."
tt0276751,157,"A box-office smash in England, About a Boy went on to charm the world as another fine adaptation (following High Fidelity) of a popular Nick Hornby novel. While High Fidelity transplanted its London charm to Chicago, this irresistible comedy was directed by Americans Chris and Paul Weitz (American Pie) with its British pedigree intact. Better yet, Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as Will, a self-absorbed trust-fund slacker who tries to improve his romantic odds by preying on desperate single mothers. His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son (Nicholas Hoult) of a suicidal mother (Toni Collette) to pose as his own son, thus proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (Rachel Weisz). The kid has a warming effect on this ultimate cad, and what could have been a sappy tearjerker turns into a subtle, frequently hilarious portrait of familial quirks and elevated self-esteem. From start to finish, it's a genuine treat.

Starring: Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Sharon Small, Toni Collette. Director: Chris & Paul Weitz."

tt0276751,160,"I didn't know what to expect when I decided to rent About a Boy, it looked like a typical romantic comedy. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Hugh Grant, he's got such a charm, I think that's why we can all forgive that little prostitute incident, lol. But anyways, for the most part, Hugh Grant always takes on the same roles for each movie, About a Boy is no exception, he plays a conceited jerk, but this movie put a fresh new twist on your typical romantic comedy movies. It's just always the same story now with romantic comedies, we always have the same guy and girl who fight and fall in love, but About a Boy puts a different look and brings the single mothers in with a guy who absolutely hates kids. Who better to play it? Hugh Grant has that charm to do it and make his character lovable despite his flaws.

Will is a single bachelor who is enjoying his life, so much, well, maybe a little too much. His friends are telling him that he should settle down, so they set up him up with a single mother. He hates kids with a passion, but he discovers the benefits of dating a single mother: being complimented on being a wonderful guy, lots of sex, and being able to please the kids easily. So when he goes to a single parent's group, he finds a woman he likes, the woman's friend who has a 12 year old son, Marcus, they all go on picnic together. But Marcus's mother tries to kill herself, so he comes up with the clever idea to get them together so she won't feel so lonely.

About a Boy is just in general a good movie, it has a strong story and very good actors. Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult were very great together, I just loved how they hung out together, my favorite scene was after everyone finds out how Will lied to everyone, that Marcus defended him. As despicable as Will was, at the same time, we all do make stupid mistakes and just need to learn from them. I really liked this movie, I would recommend it, it's a cute film and worth the watch.

7/10"
tt0276751,161,"No, I am not about to say that there is a Hugh Grant film that is better that Four Weddings and a Funeral, but this comes so damn close that it is scary.

Grant was absolutely brilliant in a film about a man who was consumed with his own self interests. Reading today's newspaper, there are a lot more out there like him than we realize. Like the children of boomers, he doesn't have concern for others in the world because he was given everything.

But, things do change, Sometimes you open the door to let others come in and you will be amazed. He did it by accident, he fought hard to go back when things didn't turn out the way he wanted, and he finally just opened to the world and started to enjoy life.

Toni Collette was also very good in this film by three brilliant writers: Peter Hedges, Chris Weitz, and Paul Weitz (the Weitz also directed) based upon a novel by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, Fever Pitch).

And, of course, any film gets and extra star when Rachel Weisz is present, even if it was only a small role."
tt0276751,162,
tt0276751,163,"Will played by the dashing Hugh Grant is a single bachelor looking for love in all the wrong places including a single parents' support group where all the other members are women who are not as attractive as he would have liked them to be. One member, Susie, draws his attention even though he falsifies being a divorced parent. Susie brings Marcus, a 12 year old boy played wonderfully by the young actor, Nicholas something, for a day at Regents' Park in London, England. The day ends with his mother's near suicide attempt. His mother is played by the unrecognizable Toni Colette in this role as Fiona, a music therapist who dresses quite like she shopped at the charity shop for her wardrobe. She is always sad, crying, and depressed over the divorce and state of her life. Her only bright spot is the love that she has for her son, Marcus who is afraid to walk in again. Marcus decides to bring Will and Fiona together. It doesn't work out that way and Will has met his match in Marcus, who is an outsider. He comes by daily to watch the show, Countdown, and leaves to go home. He has few friends at school and is taunted and harassed by his classmates. Will sees more than his mother does because she has her own problems. Marcus also becomes the shining light in Will's life as well."
tt0276751,164,"If the approaching Christmas season is prompting more calls from your Better Half for yet another by-the-numbers rom-com with Hugh Grant then maybe you might try and throw a spanner into the works with this. Yes, Grant plays another thoroughly English cad looking for love in the wrong places but this is something very different. For a start, it's much less frothy than his other films and a lot darker in tone. This is as far removed from nonsense like ""Two Weeks Notice"" or ""Bridget Jones"" as you can think of and you know something - it's all the better for it.

Grant plays Will, a professional bachelor who sponges a living off the royalties of a Christmas one-hit wonder. He likes fast cars, the latest CDs and spending his days killing time. After enjoying a brief fling with a single parent, he decides to focus his efforts on this particular group of women in hope of meaningless sex maybe turning into something else. However, he hits on the wrong woman who turns up to their date with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Striking an unlikely friendship with the bullied and seriously uncool Marcus, they both discover that they can learn much about life from the other - much to Will's surprise.

Based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name, ""About A Boy"" can best be described as viciously gentle. Tackling difficult issues with humour and pathos is never easy and certainly not when the movie is helmed by the people behind ""American Pie"". But this is one film that really breaks the mould and constantly surprises, Grant playing Will with almost shocking venom for one. Hoult is also very good as poor Marcus, though I did feel that Rachel Weisz was little more than underused eye candy. Toni Collette also does well as Marcus's bohemian mother but I felt the role was under-developed in relation to the role in the book. Something else that also changed was the ending, which veered away from the whole 'Kurt Cobain' theme of the novel and dangerously towards something like an American high school comedy. But at its heart, ""About A Boy"" is an affecting drama as well as a effective comedy. But rarely is it hilarious and this does hinder the film's appeal somewhat.

So it's a pleasant surprise lifted by class performances in the leads but like the novel, I never really felt like it deserved the amount of praise heaped upon it. The novel left me feeling cold and unengaged and the movie does too, to some extent. The characters are too remote, almost implausible, for the audience to empathise with but in spite of this, ""About A Boy"" is a hard film to dislike. Like I said, it's a very gentle film - one that surprises and even challenges you but it just never raises its game enough. A good film, then and one that certainly goes down better than ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason"" at any rate..."
tt0276751,165,"Good thing about Hugh Grant films is that they will never get old. There is always something worths seeing.

He can act the character so well that it is nearly impossible to say if this is his life or acting.

But and a very big but, the characters he plays are often so close in manners so the movies he act as the leading actor are becoming a little predictable.

We will always time by time need these kind of movies and that all harmless good guy struggle gently for something good to happen. Thanks Allah unlike some other Hollywood romantic actors his films do not contain much nudity."
tt0276751,166,"ABOUT A BOY is the sort of film that you want to buy, not just to rent. The script is served by a great cast - Toni Collette has a much harder part than Hugh Grant, even and especially Marcus.

The script follows the book closely enough and the scene that is added is the delightful ""Killing me softly"" concert scene, which is amazing because it's one of the best scenes of the whole film!

In a classic ""British romantic comedy"" vein, humour is subtle, verbal, and definitely not slapstick or vulgar (although a bit below the waist at times). The film nonetheless focuses on what a big boy and a small boy have in common (in spite of their differences) and how they can open each others' eyes. The film also manages to provide a philosophical thought while never sinking into pedantry. A pure timeless classic."
tt0276751,167,"Hugh Grant plays an immature man,Will, who doesn't want to commit to any woman.So he joins this group of single parents pretending he's a father of a baby son.Then suddenly he meets this 12-year old kid called Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).He's bullied at school and his mother Fiona (Toni Collette) is suicidal.So these two become friends and that makes Will grow up as an individual.Chris and Paul Weitz' About a Boy (2002) is based on Nick Hornby's novel.Hugh Grant does one of his best performances of his career in this film.Nicholas Hoult is a true find for the role of Marcus.Toni Collette is great as Fiona and so is Rachel Weisz as Rachel.There are plenty of brilliant scenes in this film.My favorite must be where they sing Roberta Flack's Killing Me Softly With His Song.About a Boy is a movie that brings you to a good mood.This is positively a good movie."
tt0276751,168,"Finally it's a movie about a boy and not a girl. Yes...the title of the movie is really straight forward. It was interesting to see the perspective of a man/boy throughout the movie. Especially one that is as dry but funny as Hugh Grant's character Will.

Since Will is commentating in the background of the movie most of the time, his thoughts and insight toward something is clearly stated. I'm not sure what it is but Hugh Grant has a very different humour that most people don't find funny but i seem to laugh at for hours even after the movie.

About a boy doesn't actually have a really interesting or suspenseful outline. I think it's a matter of liking the characters and appreciating their humour. If you like Hugh Grant, and want to see something kind of different, you won't be disappointed with About a Boy. 8.5/10"
tt0276751,169,"If you're one of those who think in a mystic manner about GOOD PICTURES, i recommend this one to you to change your mind right after watching the movie! ""About a boy"" was in my archive for several moments, sometimes i had a look at some sequences and damned my special friend about such movie, he had purchased for me! one night, empty and alone, i tried to watch it and soon, it was my pleasure to track the happenings! Hugh grant in my view, is one of those actors who have been ignored as a result of developing the cinema industry!! he is bright.the story has been mixed impressively with the narration on the sequences.besides, it was a recovery of my own thought about the differences between people, all around the world! and what was told in this movie, was a proof to NO DIFFERENCE! that's all pal! we all need to be cared, we all need to be loved!"

tt0276751,171,"To me, this is one of the best movie of our ages. The acting, by Hugh and Grant, was outstanding... Others were great too. The soundtrack is awesome, well done Badly Drawn Boy. And the ending, where Will stepped out of his ""Island-Living"" to stand beside Marcus was simply awesome and touching. Hugh's voice is surprisingly good, maybe he could have been a successful singer as well! I've heard that the book was pretty good but this may be one of the few movies that actually surpasses the book where it originated.

All in all, one of the best movie I have ever seen.

tt0276751,173,"I tried reading a couple of Nick Hornby books, and found them to be, invariably, tedious. I watched about 20 minutes of ""High Fidelity"", and turned it off in a state of boredom and irritation. So the DVD of ""About A Boy"" didn't encourage high hopes.

So I watched it twice. It's not just that Grant and Collette and Hoult are so brilliant in their roles. It's the mix of comedy and genuine pathos, the identification with the characters, the mix of laughter and tears, the feeling of being stunned at the restaurant scene when Grant, humiliated, lets loose with the truth while the boy watches, astounded - so many riveting scenes, so much exceptional dialogue.

I loved this film - a 10/10"

tt0276751,176,"A quirky film that reminded me slightly of films like Rushmore and The Royal Tenanbaums, but more down to earth and realistic than those two. The dark humor is laugh-out-loud and clever. The sad scenes make you want to cry. I've never cared for Hugh Grant in the past because he usually plays a smirky arrogant character, but his acting in About A Boy blows away everything else he's ever done. Toni Collette's suicidal character was a bit over the top but everyone else in the film did a superb job. The musical score by Badly Drawn Boy oddly fits, reminding me of Cat Stevens' 1970s soulful musings. The boy who plays Marcus was adorable without being fakey or cloyingly sweet...he was just the right touch. Definitely worth seeing!"
tt0276751,177,
tt0276751,178,"Not entirely faithful to Nick Hornby's great book, but is a huge improvement on its messy ending and perfectly judges and re-creates the book's theme of friendship in a funny and deeply moving way. The film manages to deal with suicide and relationships of all kinds in a believable and honest way. The film focuses on the relationship developed between immature and selfish thirty-something Will and mature and naive twelve year old Marcus. Hugh Grant excels in his finest role as Will and brings humour and emotion to his emotionally immature character. Nicholas Hoult is impressive as Marcus, carrying almost the entire emotional weight of the film with ease. Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz provide excellent supporting turns but are slightly overshadowed by Grant and Hoult. The film features intelligent and sensitive direction from Chris and Paul Weitz that brilliantly captures both humour and emotion without being maudlin or ruining the book's very British identity. Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack is sensitive, compelling and never intrusive, simply adding power and emotion to the actor's performances. This is a truly great film that is entertaining and touching in equal measure."
tt0276751,179,"Hugh Grant starts this movie as the kind of guy most people would kill to be like: someone that doesn't have to work for money, ever, has all the time in the world and no personal or emotional attachments other than his breeder sister that he sees only occasionally. He sticks with the John Milton motto of ""Every man is an island"" and feels rather content about it, shagging women as he goes along.

In the end, though, he realizes that he has accomplished nothing in his life, that he needs other people and the emotions associated with them and everything ends happily. Or does it? :)

The movie is filled with good British humour, sarcastic and powerful, funny situations and the kind of feeling that gets you to smile during the entire film. I do despise the moral, but at least it is not soapy. It is perfect to watch with the girlfriend and even a tight bunch of guys would appreciate the movie."
tt0276751,180,"Judging from the box cover from the DVD, and from the first 30 minutes of watching this movie, I knew it would be a lame movie.

How wrong I was. This is a very well-directed movie. I suspect the target audience who will appreciate this movie will either have children, or be at least 30 years old.

I would not have appreciated this movie when I was 25 years old.

This movie is surprisingly well-directed. The acting is very good, with characters coming into the story that can make you believe this story is an actual documentary. But it's not.

I won't give away any of the story, as it's well worth learning on your own.

But I am a bit surprised that this movie is rated PG-13. While it mostly fits into this category, it does have scenes which only an older audience who has experienced love and/or a man who is a late-in-life ""Player"" mentality. The topics of sex, which the main male character seemingly sugar-coats over the real cravings of an adult, will probably be lost on the younger crowd, if not deemed inappropriate for the younger crowd.

The discussion boards for this movie have proved this. But for the right audience, this movie is surprisingly well done, despite the cheezy box cover for the DVD and the first half hour."
tt0276751,181,"The first time I saw this film I just bought it because it was on sale, and because I like Hugh Grant. Now I'm glad I did because this was a ""bloody"" good film!!!!! LOL!!!!!!! Anyways the whole point to this movie is about a young boy and a man. In a way I guess you can say that they needed each other. The young boy (Marcus) is going through a rough time at both home and school. He has a mentally ill mother and a tough time at school because everybody judges him because he's a little strange. Now the man (Will) is a low life with a great house. He has no job and he loves women. He trys to meet younger women by a club called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) because he thinks most of the good looking women are parents. He mets a women there and from her he meets Marcus. And they go through the roughest times together. I love this movie a lot and the meaning of it. It's great to see with your loved ones and good friends. Great laughs. Loud cries."

tt0276751,183,
tt0276751,184,"There were several aspects that made me appreciate this movie despite my personal reluctance to commend comedies of similar arrangements.

First of all I found the inner monologues of the two main characters an inventive and unusual feature. This added to the comedy aspect and caused hilarious scenes. In addition it added depth to the characters themselves, which is something comedies of this sort normally lack. To put this into the right perspective, some of the thoughts we are presented with are rather artificial, but still, the approach itself and its effect on the storyline is something that needs to be appreciated.

The plot is modest, but has some unexpected strengths. I was frankly surprised about the mix of realistic challenges of life and the comedy aspects, as I thought the latter would be the movie's emphases. However, they were in balance - the movie dealt with real problems many members of the audience are probably able to relate to. The comedy was sometimes too artificial, but it seems to have worked in this case.

Hugh Grant and his attitude towards life is one major theme, Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus the second prevailing one. The movie then focuses on these two characters and makes them influence each other - which leads to interesting changes and challenges for the protagonists, and that is what puts this movie above the ordinary.

I generally do not like Hugh Grant's humor. Here again he seems a bit uncomfortable as Nicholas' partner. He kind of aces his comedy parts with his very own sense of entertaining the audience, but as soon as it comes to difficult scenes demanding more than superficial acting, he seems - yeah, a bit uneasy.

Nonetheless, considering the general lack of sophistication comedies such as these aim at, this movie is an improvement. The father-son relationship which is subtly addressed lacks real emotional depth - again something which accrues from the movie's arrangement as a comedy - but is decent to watch and carries some messages.

I personally like Hugh Grant's philosophy of life - something many male singles will be able to relate to somehow - and the way he justifies his attitude. The changes which happen after he has encountered Marcus make this movie worthwhile, as they entail a character development and some messages of life.

'No man is an island' - Marcus' last words and his face as the closing scene made me appreciate this movie as a whole, because it really made its way off the corny trash and has managed to mix comedy with sincere issues of life - something hard to find."
tt0276751,185,"I was skeptical of this movie having read the book some years ago. Firstly I had seen High Fidelity the movie based on another of Hornby's books and was very disappointed. Secondly I had a mild allergy to Hugh Grant who previously had seemed only capable of playing the same helpless, foppish character in every movie. The kind of character that women allegedly find adoring on screen, but if you were ever to act that way in reality they would beat you senseless with a frying pan after an hour.

Imagine my surprise then when I was treated to this absolutely stunning movie. Hugh Grant finally proved that he can act and does a stunning job in a new type of character. Likewise the ""boy"" is excellent as are all other actors. This movie is totally engrossing and hugely entertaining while still tackling difficult subjects like growing up and trying to fit in at school while you have problems at home. It combines serious issues but also some very amusing scenes as well. The pacing is perfect and the music compliments the atmosphere admirably.

There is no other movie that I have ever watched as many times as I have this one. Every time I enjoy it and marvel at it. I am totally unable to criticise it as the whole thing meshes to a very, very satisfying piece of work. Certainly one of my favorites, up there in the company of 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects and other excellent movies."
tt0276751,186,"I loved this movie. I almost fell off my chair when i learned that the creators of ""American pie"" made this! Wow!

Suddenly the writers, director, producers decided to focus on some pithy truths and some lovely characters. I also laughed hysterically, especially when Grant's character can't even attempt doing philanthropic work without turning it into another opportunity to hit on a woman - a woman he hasn't even seen yet, he's so overzealous.

Hugh Grant, who i have always found attractive, absolutely outdid himself. He showed a person with a lot more going on in his brain than trying to seduce all the women of the world with his looks. He was perfect in this role (maybe too perfect, eh?) as a pathetic,shallow man but who finds he is capable of so much more.

it is brilliant that a child comes along to rescue him, to show him the way to love, that the movies depicts love in our difficult times. It was the love in the movie that moved me.

it seems that the filmmaker has gone through a similar metamorphosis going from shallow themes to this! Applause!!!!!!!! I'll give him a nine so if the director reads this, it won't go to his head giving him a ten."
tt0276751,187,"This movie is a great. Hip, smart, but heartwarming, About A Boy is the tale of Will, an English womanizer who will do literally anything to get women. In the course of these endeavors, he meets Marcus, a troubled boy with a hippy vegan single mother. As their friendship develops they teach each other something about love, friendship, family, and how to love and be loved is the most important thing on earth.

Hugh Grant is superb as Will. This character could have been written with him in mind. His dry wit and comic timing will have you laughing. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, Emma) shines as Marcus' mother, a clinically depressed single mum struggling to stay sane for her son. The young Nicholas Hoult is a natural as Marcus, a lonely school outcast wiser than his years.

The music, performed by British band Badly Drawn Boy is excellent, the soundtrack standing on it's own as a must-have album. Definitely a film worth adding to the shelf."
tt0276751,188,"Hugh Grant has become famous with his typical roles in comedies like for instance ""Bridget Jones's Diary"", ""Notting Hill"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and in a way this is once again such a movie. So I guess, if you liked him in the movies that I previously mentioned, than you should give this one a try as well. If not, than you better leave it alone.

This time, Grant plays the role of Will. Will is a hip guy who lives on his own in a nice loft in London, who drives a fancy car, who wears pretty clothes and who doesn't have to work because he lives of the royalties from a Christmas song his dad once wrote, and what's even better for him: he doesn't have a family to take care of... And then he thinks of a new tactic to pick up single women. He'll go to a self-help group for single parents where he, while passing himself for a single dad (which he isn't of course), can meet a lot of young single mothers, all very eager to become his next sexual object. But Will's hope of staying a bachelor for the rest of his life is interrupted when he meets the 12-year old Marcus, a very uncool kid that will eventually teach him how to grow up as he teaches the kid to be cool...

In a way this is a very typical Grant movie. I wouldn't even be surprised if someone told me that this movie was written especially for him. And it has to be said, he does a nice job. It's all rather predictable of course and you know what will happen most of the time, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't any good. I really liked Grant as the eternal bachelor and all other actors did a nice job as well. That's why I give this movie a 7/10."
tt0276751,189,"About a boy is a very good comedy. Normally I only laugh at comedy films either when I'm with my friends or watching a real hilarious movie (Airplane, Meet the Parents). But this film didn't have that bad jokes. They were very subtle. You had to have seen the previous scene. If not, there's no point in watching the rest of the film. Hugh Grants' character was very well chosen. He was like a college boy, but a little bit more mature. The little kid Marcus was also well chosen (especially the hair due).

To sum everything up, it's not a movie to watch alone with a lot of concentration, but it is still a high quality picture.

Now you don't see that anymore these days."
tt0276751,190,"About a Boy is a story about Will who lives off his father's fortune. He's in your face rude, and hilariously funny at the same time. He has no care for any other people, and all he's really interested is getting beautiful single moms to go out with him. To do this, he must pretend to have a son of his own...which leads to hysterical situations. Marcus is a kid going to a private school where no one wants to be his friend. His mom is really Depressed, and nothing seems to be going right in this kids life. Of course, then from some twist of fate, Marcus and Will meet. They are complete opposites, but they find that they can help each other. About a Boy is a cute movie, recommended for all ages over thirteen. There is some rather harsh English language, but overall, this movie would be in my top ten."
tt0276751,191,"Hugh Grant has had a very good streak of being in the good English Movie and this one also lie in that category. In fact, this movie is so good that it might be put on top of the categories.

After inherit a large sum of fortune from his Singer/Song Writer father, Will (Hugh) decides to do nothing with his life. His dairy routine is tried to get a date with single mom. That is his life until one day he got introduce to one strange young boy who change his life around and vise versa for the boy.

This movie have shown a great chemistry between the two very different characters, and the most special of all it is very interesting and flawless. The flows of the movie sail out very smoothly till the very end, the directing and lighting is very delightful, the acting is great; especially the British accents.

Over all this is a very complete romantic comedy with a very charming casts that it is hard to dislike it.

Recommendation: One Of The Best Romantic Comedy.

Rating: 8.5/10 (Grade: A-) Thank You, For Reading !!!"
tt0276751,192,"When I rented this movie I had absolutely no idea what this film was about. Even though the title clearly told me it was About A Boy. However, the movie quickly evolves into a good and well written film.

Being a huge fan of Hugh Grant I of course was encouraged to check out this film. Hugh Grant delivers another classic humorous performance. He plays a selfish man who lives all by himself and does nothing for a living. They aren't kidding when they say nothing. After getting rich off of this father's one hit wonder song, Will (Grant) never had any inspiration to do work in life. He just searches around aimlessly for some type of romance. One day, he meets a lady who is a single parent. Will soon discovers that single mothers are great people to date. Not only are they good people, but also they are vulnerable. In a desperate attempt to find more single mothers, Will visits a single parents club. At this group he lies to many of these mothers by telling them he has a child. Eventually he gets a date with a women there who introduces him to her friends son named Marcus, a scrawny 12 year old boy. Marcus takes comfort in Will when his mother loses it, creating a bonding friendship between Will and Marcus.

What's charming about this film is the fact that thirty something and a 12 year old are able to become such great friends. The whole thought of it sounds a bit crazy but thats what really helps to bring this film to life. Along with great writers as well as great performances from Hugh Grant and from NIcholas Hoult (Marcus) So overall I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a good heartwarming comedy."
tt0276751,193,"When I heard what this film was about first it didn't seem that appealing to me as a comedy. A bachelor in his 30's living in London, England. Who spends his days enjoying himself and deciding the next party he should attend and with who. His life is then interrupted by an unwelcome 12 year old boy Marcus who wants to be his friend and this is where the story matures. Least to say I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this film only disappointed by the fact I didn't get to see it in the cinema with the addition of the crowd's laughter.

Hugh Grant plays Will the irresponsible big kid in the movie that is most likely the envy of most men out there. With this character I think this is where Grant shines as an actor in the perfect part for him, a dry witted bachelor who is afraid of commitment but still gets to go out with nice ladies and have lots of cool big boy's toys in his spacious well equipped apartment. Think American Psycho without the killings.

There is one feature in the film that I particularly do not like which made me realize, how important it is to choose the right 'Music' for a film. Most of the music in the film is done by 'Badly Drawn Boy' although not particularly bad when heard once but it is played throughout the whole film. It is suited to some scenes but there could have been a little variety.

Even though the film does have strong themes about growing up and taking responsibility, it never gets too serious to take you out of a giddy mood.

This is highly recommended for Hugh Grant fans and anyone who enjoyed 'Four weddings and a funeral'.

8* out of 10"
tt0276751,194,"Normally I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant. He seems to play the same role again and again. His plumby accent also promotes a sort of stereotype for British people, which is pretty unfair - take the divine Sean Bean for a grittier model.

There are two films in which I have been impressed by Hugh Grant. One is B J's diary - he seems to ring truer playing a nasty character. The other is in this film. In About A Boy, he is a lazy b*****d with few morals - the kind of person with more money than they deserve who annoys the rest of society, unless he's buying something expensive from your shop. Alone, this portrayal would be amusing. But what makes About A Boy great is the other characters in combination with this one. It is the relationship with the child, and to some extent his mother, which really provides the bewitching charm.

8 out of 10. Ko, Izzy."
tt0276751,195,"I sat down to watch this at home on cable (while doing something else like I usually do with cable movies) with no expectations having read or seen so little about it years ago I'd forgotten it all. I wasn't immediately grabbed, but found myself totally wrapped up in it and had forgotten all about whatever else I was doing.

I just watched it again and find it completely satisfying - I don't find it hilarious, but the jokes/lines are like ""inside jokes"" in that they remind me of personal memories I wouldn't want to share all the time...and find myself smiling and laughing at them instead of cringing!

well acted, thoughtful and a movie I may buy just to have it around to make me smile.

and the soundtrack is tremendous - buying it definitely!"
tt0276751,196,"It's rather like looking into a mirror. What we see, like or dislike in him may be what we see, like or dislike in ourselves.

It's a rare trait to have, and Hugh Grant seems to possess it in abundance. No particular point of view. No special ambition. No burning agenda.

Thus his role in ""About a Boy"" is ideal for this fine actor. Grant perfectly plays this vapid, irresponsible playboy, who fortunately realizes his own lack of character and grows in the enactment.

He has help from other characters with whom he comes in contact, including a boy and some single-parent moms. While the growth may be minimal, there's some progress, and the promise of future pleasantries with a congenial groupie.

Like his role in ""Notting Hill,"" the feel of this comedy drama's light as a souffle, yet constantly buoyed by Grant's unique persona and neat direction by Chris and Paul Weitz (memorable from ""Chuck and Buck"").

""About a Boy"" may seem lightweight, yet notice how it holds the attention straight through to its consonant conclusion."
tt0276751,197,"Strangely enough, this modestly produced film is one of the most original recent films. Most comedies fit into some other genre (Romantic, ""Dumb,"" etc.) but this one doesn't. The closest it gets is romantic comedy, but that doesn't even fit. Also, the writer of the book, Nick Hornby, helped with the movie, which has had some great changes, namely a much better ending than in the book.

Hugh Grant is at his best here, as a very cynical bachelor of about thirty named Will who doesn't have the pressure of work upon him, thus devoting all his time to women. He kind of reminds me of a high school student. Being the ""Love them and leave them"" type, he has had his share of breakups. Then he dates a single mum. Just as he's about to break up with her, she breaks up with him! As Will puts it, ""Guilt free parting."" Thus, Will is on an endless search for single mums. Through this search he meets Marcus, a schoolboy has trouble being a boy, played by Nicholas Hoult.

""About a Boy"" says quite a lot, if you manage to catch it, and is one of the funnier non-""Dumb"" comedies out there, (curiously enough, directed by the brothers who gave you ""American Pie."") and it's overall quite enjoyable to watch. Grant and Hoult are hilarious together, with their extreme character contrasts. A thousand word review can hardly do it justice."
tt0276751,198,"I first saw this movie while on a business trip to Chattanooga. I needed to finish up some work on a presentation I was making the next day and there was nothing on TV, so I decided to splurge and rent an On-Demand movie. Most of the movies I had either seen, or had no interest in seeing and just as I was about to turn it off, I came across About A Boy. I hadn't heard much buzz about the movie and I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, but for reasons unknown to me, I rented it.

I was expecting another one of Hugh Grant's saccharine romantic comedies where he plays a charming befuddling fop as he's done ad nauseam since Four Weddings And A Funereal. Granted, I liked Four Weddings immensely, but by Notting Hill I'd had my fill. Much to my surprise, Grant was playing a completely different character and was clearly attempting to break his mold. He'd done that once before in Bridget Jones' Diary, where he played a jerk, but now he was taking it in another direction entirely. It's a refreshing and more importantly interesting change.

But this movie isn't all about Hugh Grant's character Will. His co-star is new comer Nicholas Hoult, who plays the boy Marcus and he carries his own. Ultimately, the movie is about both of them, and so Hoult has the responsibility of carrying half the weight of the movie and he does a splendid job. Rounding out the cast is Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, each do an excellent job as well. Suffice to say that the casting for this movie is brilliant. Each character is fully developed and rich with complexity and emotion. I bought each and every one of them. Not once did I feel that there was a weak link in the bunch. That's also surprising because this type of movie is hard to pull off.

So what kind of movie is this? At it's heart, this movie is a comedy. That being said, with subject matter such as suicide, it is most definitely a drama as well. That's a fine line to walk in a film but Weitz Brothers deftly manage to pull it off. Granted their movie is based on the Hornby book by the same name, so they had a rich palette to begin with, but the brothers clearly rose to the challenge and created a fantastic movie. There have been plenty of good books that have been butchered at the box office and Boy is a rare exception. There's no cliche' choices made by the characters and the director's did a great job at staying true to the tone of the book. Chris and Paul also stretched themselves with their camera work and it pays off. If you're into `film' there's a lot to chew on between the use of jump cuts, depth of focus and swing shots. None of this gets in the way of the movie. If anything these camera techniques add to the performances and help tell the story.

Interweaving it's way throughout the movie and in some cases almost playing a role in the film, is the music and it is spot on. All the music was written by Badly Drawn Boy specifically for this movie. I was not familiar with the artist prior to seeing the film, but the director's couldn't have made a better choice. Although each song stands on it's own on the soundtrack, each song also easily blends into the scene and lends a hand in creating just the right tone for the movie. After listening to the soundtrack, I could imagine it as simply a regular artist release, so it stands on it's own. Yet when it's worked into the movie it's pure gold.

So why do I like it so much? I'd like to think that I'm not alone in this, but it's because I can relate to the movie on so many levels. There are so many scenes that I could describe, but in the end I would be retelling the entire movie. Every scene has something in it that is worth watching again and again. I can relate to Marcus as he's picked on in school, tries to cope with his mother's depression and ultimately knowingly faces complete and utter embarrassment as a last ditch effort to make his mother happy. The names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, but I've been there. Then there's Will who has to finally face his demons and his father's legacy in order to join the human race and be a part of other peoples lives. Although not an exact context, I've been there in one way shape or form.

Surprisingly, I caught myself watching it again the other day on DVD and it struck me that this movie is now in my Top 10, or dare I say Top 5 movie list. I maybe be borrowing from another fantastic Hornby book/movie High Fidelity, but it's true. It's not Citizen Kane, but it is one of the best movies that takes a funny look at becoming a man through two different people. In trying to describe this movies to others, I've called it `A guy's romantic comedy.' That doesn't really nail it on the head, but I'd like to think that About A Boy, IS a guy's movie. The subject matter may not have Rambo's, or Rocky's, but any guy who can think about something other than sports, or monster trucks should get something from this movie. It's Hugh Grant's best work to date. It's based on a hugely successful book and it's funny as hell. What's not to like?

I give it a 5 out of 5 stars."
tt0276751,199,"Hugh Grant plays Will, a lazy and carefree man who believes he is an island from humanity. His life turns upside down when a geeky boy named Marcus befriends him when he tries to set him up with his depressant, suicidal mother. Throughout his friendship with Marcus, Will discovers that everyone has to have backup in life, even if it means risking it all for someone.

The jokes are witty and cynical and keep the laughs comming. A great scene is when Marcus is in a school concert and Will saves his performance of ""Killing me softly"". The audience of the concert reacts to this with great results. Duck, Will!

About a Boy is a delightful comedy that is bound to be a part of your DVD collection. Check it out!

Grade- B+"
tt0276751,200,"I watched this movie because I was bored out of my mind and it was the only movie that my housemate had that I hadnt already seen.

30mins in...still bored...

However, whereas my initial impressions of the movie may have been guided by the fact that I was already in a state of utter boredom, and the fact that I had resorted to watching a ""chick flik"", this film began to grow on me.

I dislike Hugh Grant movies because his characters seem to be somewhat similar to say the least. This is a general rule, but as a relatively open-minded person, I decided to continue watching. And after a while, I find myself smiling...then came the laughter...then, I had completely forgotten that I was only watching this movie because I was bored.

The best description of this movie is that it is a ""nice"" movie. A movie about a guy who wants for nothing in life, but due to his growing relationship with a boy who is having problems living with his suicidal single mother, Grant's character begins to want for a little more in his empty, lonely life.

Ok, guys, watch the movie with the girlfriend if you like, but it is certainly worth watching. I doubt anyone who watches it from start to finish could say that they truly disliked it.

7/10 (A decent, honest, ""nice"" movie)"
tt0276751,201,"Never read the book so don't know what the original is like. Real, everything told here is painfully real that I flipped over some scene like Fiona's suicide, campus bully on Marcus (Why such an old Latin name? Fits his outfit and precocious filial piety to his mom).

I couldn't feel any ""English humour"" here but a long list of social problems: single parent, over-individualistic society, suicidal parent, lingering depression, campus bully, idle non-needy 30+ (who does nothing in life but not short of funds and still under the wings of his father's music royalties), freezing (or frozen??) human relationship, skeptical love relationship, ephemeral marriages, all very convincing and true.

Will ""Lightman"", well, what a good name for his life is ""blank"" with nothing so it's very ""light"", a light man with no substance (or untapped latent substance, God knows.)

A likable production yet HG as a 38-year-old single never-married man who needs to sneak and tell lies to look for a woman in the ""SPAT"" is entirely unbelievable. A chap with such a nice face and worry-free living can easily pick a woman, Brit or non-Brit (who speaks English) for a long relationship, I just got to know a few in Europe including the UK (in Manchester). Get James Nesbitt or Robert Carlyle to speak in proper Queen's English or Received Pronunciation, pretend to be English, bingo! Hunky blokes just don't work out.

A good flick about a man in his late-30s whose mind finally got blasted to grow by a kid twice junior to his age. A ""come of age"" film about Will."
tt0276751,202,"About a boy (or ""The day of the Dead Duck"", as it's also called in German): A good film which you should watch if you like traditional Hugh Grant films - Four Weddings, Notting Hill etc. The film is based on the essential tenet that man is changeable, which is a shame, as I found the Hugh Grant character at the start of the film rather a role-model. This film mixes a classy Badly Drawn Boy soundtrack together with good acting, good comedy moments (the duck) and a generally ok plot. Only generally ok, though, because of the huge gaps it leaves at certain points. To this end, I found watching the deleted scenes on the dvd useful: do so if you get the chance. That said, the film is not about a boy, it's about a thirtysomething. Not having read the Nick Hornby book, I can't say how true to the book that is. Highly recommendable for innocent, unintellectual fun."
tt0276751,203,"I really enjoyed this film. Hugh Grant is better now he's put his affable clumsiness behind him(for this movie anyway. It's back with a vengeance in Love Actually). It's literary roots were fairly obvious, through the extensive voiceovers, which I felt were a little overdone. Sometimes the dialogue was a little stilted, particularly when Marcus (The Boy) had some 'grown-up' things to say. Otherwise, an enjoyable night out. It's just unfortunate that a film that tries to establish itself as British had to be directed by two Americans, previously responsible for American Pie.

My wife has read the book and says it was completely different, but she still enjoyed the movie nonetheless."
tt0276751,204,"This film was absolutely wonderful. Hugh Grant was at his best once more (as he always tends to be), and Toni Collete was hysterical. At first when I saw it, I thought it was mediocre, but as time went on, it grew on me immensely, and I've come to love it. I'm often laughed at for laughing at this movie while watching it by myself...but you simply can't help it."
tt0276751,205,"""About a Boy"" has the cynical touch of humour and honesty reminiscent to that of ""Birdget Jones' Diary"", which is rightly so as it comes from the same directors. It is the kind of movie that makes one chill out, take time to laugh at oneself and not take life too seriously. Typically well-cast is: Hugh Grant, plays the lead role very appropriatley of a womanising, swanky pushing-forty man, who refuses to grow up and accept any responsibilities, Nicholas Hoult, a relative newcoming child actor, provides a pleasant surprise with his superb performance as the young boy Marcus, and the lovable Toni Collette who plays his eccentric, 'hippy' mother. All in all, ""About A Boy"" is the kind of coming-of-age movie that everyone needs to see once in a while. Delightful, it will appeal to many different people."
tt0276751,206,"I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but thank God it wasn't. No cheesy dialouge, ooey gooey feelings or ""Oh, I hope they get together in the ends"". It was hilarious from start to finish, in that great ""why do I feel embarrassed when it's not happening to me"" kinda way.

Hugh Grant was perfectly cast. Only he could make such an unlikeable character strangely likeable. I've loved Toni Colette since ""Muriels Wedding"" and her depressive, if not near psychopathic tendancies portrayed in the movie do not dissapoint. The beautiful Rachel Weiss could have been written into the script a little more, and three cheers for the actor portraying Marcus. I thought I had it bad as a child. I'm not going to ramble on and on like I do for movies that were just awful, because I don't want to ruin any aspect of the movie for someone deciding to rent it. It's definatley worth seeing. Even my boyfriend who groaned when I brought it home was laughing and singing ""Shake yo ass, watch yoself, shake yo ass, show me what your workin with"" by the end of the movie. Skip the crap thats in the theaters right now, and rent ""About a Boy"". :)"
tt0276751,207,"ABOUT A BOY ****

Forever the cynic about the next best movie tag, I was quite undecided about whether to watch this movie. There was Hugh Grant, this little boy I had never seen, and some women who fitted the chick flick criteria perfectly. In the end I backed my better judgement and decided to give the movie a go, but even though Grant was headlining I was still trepidacious. About a Boy is exceptional, in not only its story telling and unravelling of the characters but in its balance between humour, sadness and interesting thought provoking points of view. Grant plays Will, a self indulgent wannabe romeo, who spends his days using up 'units of time' as he puts it. In one of the funniest passages in the movie he describes this concept, and without delving into it too much he believes that he enjoys a perfect balance of relaxation and fun. How can he do this you might ask; easy, you live off the royalties of your father's hit Christmas song. He is convinced in himself, he knows what he is and what he wants to do and his pathway is clear of such daily obstacles like finance, trust, dependance and stress. He is complete. But he's not of course. Deep down he knows the shallowness of such an existance where the innocent daily ritual of watching quiz shows blends into his alter-ego nightlife.

Void of any life variables he exists in his vacuum, until a twelve year old boy uncovers a sinister truth. Will you see has been on the search for available women, and he uncovers a group whereby single mothers go to feel good about themselves and to relieve the stresses of total independence. He is the only male single parent in the group, and soon he weaves a web of deception about his very own son. The women fall for it. He is pleased with his efforts and another lie is notched onto his bedpost. The movie gets going when Will and a mother from the group decide to meet, but she brings along with her the boy of another woman who has been ill. From then on relationships are formed, dissolved, papered over and engineered.

The movie was superb in almost every respect. The directors needn't have looked no further than Grant, for if you want caddish charm and an air of unassured assurance, Grant is your man. He is wonderful throughout. The 'boy' in question is played brilliantly by Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, the son of a hippie type who cannot get to grips with the evolving millenium. He doesn't seem like other kids and sometimes I wondered whether or not the movie would fob me off with another 'the underachieving nobody defeats all in the end' tagline. To a tiny extent it does, but the story remains real and believable to itself which was refreshing. And Toni Collete is also wonderful as Fiona, the depressive mother of Marcus. Their love for each other is evident, but she frets that she cannot give the thing she cherishes the most the best in life. Marcus doesn't mind, he just wants her to be there for him, although the inner rejection she feels for not being the perfect mother is sometimes too much to handle in some harrowing scenes.

All of the other characters also played their parts extremely well. It was an exciting and rivetting movie, that had its fair share of serious moments as well as some brilliantly executed comic scenes. It is also deeply touching, with a sort of refreshing feel good factor that firmly bases itself on reality. By that I mean that not all questions were answered, and that some aspects of life remain troubling. The central combination of Will and Marcus worked splendidly as well. Marcus' naivity and innocence was blended paradoxically with a kind of know how and some semblance of street wise occasionally. Inquisitive and well meaning, the partnership forged between the two was entertaining if nothing else. Watch it if you can, even if at first you have some reservations like me, because About a Boy is a genuinely terrific movie. People grow, find a certain peace with themselves and along the way involve themselves in moments of comedy. An excellent movie."
tt0276751,208,"This was the BEST movie ever! All the characters rock! SEE THIS MOVIE! It was a romantic, funny and wonderful film. Hung and Nickolus were great and they were very well played. I have seen this movie like 10 times and i never get sick of it.......C it now!!!!!!!!!!!!"
tt0276751,209,"After seeing DVD, I think myself is really an Island! Ironically, I have Will's character but poor as Marcus so I must work. If I had a father could write a hit song and gave me legacy, my island will be free for everything; not to pretend I'm easygoing or generosity or modesty or ....socially normal woman! But my true color is hard to hide, Everyday off work, don't know where to go, just went to coffee shop and type my note book. In holidays, I have no idea where to go but only one friend to accompany to go to department store. Or go to see the movie! However, I have no interest to imitate Will to go to single parent party, because men and women are different."

tt0276751,211,"'About a Boy' is not what you'd expect from the people who brought you 'American Pie' and 'High Fidelity'. It has tremendous heart. Will (played by Hugh Grant) is a slacker who lives off royalties of his father's one hit song. Through a series of sleazy events (he joins a single parent group to meet loose chicks) he meets a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hault) who is going through a crisis. His mom is suicidal and he realizes if she goes, he'll be all alone. So he starts hanging out with Will in an attempt to make a friend to lean on. Will takes to Marcus and becomes sort of a mentor of coolness (Marcus's mother is a hippie, so she doesn't know what's what). Eventually Will takes Marcus for granted and realizes that he is only a shell of a man, who is nothing without his friend Marcus. The movie's moral is 'No man is an Island' and that you need people in your life to make it worthwhile. From the directors of 'American Pie' and the Author of 'High Fidelity'. Hugh Grant is very charming in this and all the performances are wonderful. Stays very true to the great book, while changing the ending (which is better in the film). This a surprise movie that has become one of my favorites, because it's funny and heartwarming in a non-cornball kind of way.

**** out of ****"
tt0276751,212,"We held off watching this movie for quite some time. A real shame. The movie brings talented acting, intelligent in-sights, humor, and reality to the screen. It's difficult for us to read other reviews and find that some critics did not find enjoyment with this film. So often, we don't get our money's worth when watching even the more expensively made films. We can only say that this movie lifts the spirit and is one worth adding to a DVD collection. To see the growth achieved by both a selfish bachelor on the prowl for single mothers and a young school boy in need of a father's input was wonderful. The movie allows for character growth of not just the two main stars but also of those surrounding them. To accomplish this dramatic feat, with the continuously subtle humor of the film is an excellent achievement."
tt0276751,213,"Considering this was directed by two Americans, About a Boy is very, very English. I was worried the Weitz bros. would dumb it down for the US market, but I was wrong. Hugh Grant ( whom I normally can't stand) is excellent in his role as one of Hornby's typical men-who-are-afraid-to-commit-to-serious-relationships. Nicholas Hoult, too, is wonderful as the sullen outcast child. In reference to another person's comments that Hoult can't sing, I must remind him/her that IT WAS INTENTIONAL! By the way, make sure you watch the deleted scenes. The one where Hugh buys a car seat for his 'son' is hilarious."
tt0276751,214,"I don't have to tell you that life is full of surprises. However, despite its very definition, I was not prepared for the surprise I had while watching this film. Perhaps it is because I went into it expecting to hate it, but because of my New Year's resolution to try to be more open-minded in my film viewing I decided to give it a shot. (That doesn't mean that I am about to watch anything involving J. Lo or Sandra Bullock  a woman has her limits) But I'll tell you why I expected to hate it: My grandmother and aunt loved it. Absolutely nothing against their taste in films, but I've generally learned that I will never accept Meg Ryan as my personal savior, and they will never worship at the altar of Stanley Kubrick. So I went into About a Boy with trepidation, but I went into it.

What a wonderful choice, because it is an amazing film. While under the guise of a comedy, it examines some very compelling issues, and treats them seriously. Hugh Grant, who I feel has not done a decent film since Four Weddings and a Funeral, is brilliant in his portrayal of Will, a guy who has no idea what he wants in life and is one step worse than shallow: He readily acknowledges his shallowness. Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is endearing as Marcus, the 12 year old boy Will begrudgingly takes under his wing. (This kid also has the most interesting eyebrows in cinema right now) Toni Collette rounds out the main cast as Marcus' depressed mother, a woman whose fragility is painful to experience through the eyes of her son.

In terms of the story, the theme of `finding oneself' is certainly not new to cinema, but About a Boy addresses it in such a charming manner that even this extremely cynical viewer was drawn in immediately. I watched this film (as I do most films) by myself, and was actually disappointed when I had to immediately interact with friends after seeing it because it's subtle profundity made me want to sit and reflect upon it.

Although I generally don't like the actors involved, I don't normally `do' touching comedies, and About A Boy is the first Nick Hornby book I wasn't able to get through, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, so that makes this a great film in my eyes. And for once this is a movie that I can pretty much recommend to anyone. So what do I think of praising a film my grandmother loved? I'll tell you once I get the sound of the four horsemen out of my head it's so distracting.

tt0276751,215,"Two stars who had huge hits in the 90s have set about to rehabilitate their somewhat treacly public personas. Robin Williams is leaving Mrs. Doubtfire behind to concentrate on more challenging dramatic roles in films like Insomnia and One Hour Photo. The other actor is Hugh Grant who created a stereotype for himself in 1994 as Charles the bumbling, clever English guy in Four Weddings and a Funeral. It's an image he's tried hard to shake, and he just might have done it with About A Boy. Oh, he's still clever, and he's still English, but now he is a trust-fund baby, who treats women miserably and hasn't worked a day in his life. As Will, Grant brings to life one of the screen's most unabashedly self absorbed characters. His redemption  you know he can't stay bad forever  has the perfume of cliché to it, but Grant is so good, and the script so witty the viewer can accept the inevitable Hollywood ending. Special mention goes to Nicholas Hoult who plays the twelve-year old that finally teaches Grant that life has some meaning, and to Toni Collette who suicidal hippie mother routine is poignant without being syrupy."
tt0276751,216,"As I get older and now have kids, I find that I'm liking these sorts of movies more and more. Hugh Grant the hunk as a loser makes me feel better about myself. Actually, most of the characters exhibit major flaws, so I can really feel good about myself. Surprisingly, despite the obvious pleasant outcome, I didn't find myself staring at the clock (well, maybe once or twice). This is a good date movie guys, because you will look like quite a catch next to these people."
tt0276751,217,"***

This is a pretty good comedy-drama. It is often funny and doesn't try to manipulate you when it gets serious. Which is rarely. All the actors give fine performances and it is well directed. It's only problem is that it resorts to sappiness at the end."
tt0276751,218,"This film was great. Not in my top 10 or even my top 100 but great all the same. We can identify with every character because they are real. we all know these people and we have all dealt with them. Hugh Grant once again gets all the cool witty lines but he is so good at the delivery that it's worth it. Watch it with your partner, Mother, Father, whoever. But watch it. It's a really good laugh."
tt0276751,219,"It's not just Hugh Grant fluff!!! Here I was expecting something to watch while grading papers and doing housework, but it actually had some good stuff to it. ""Marcus"" is wonderful, the self absorbed Fiona frighteningly believable (I've met moms like that...) and Hugh was even looking thoughtful! A fun one, with a little meat."
tt0276751,220,"About a boy is the story of a man realizing that there is more to his life than himself. I am not sure I have ever seen this situation played out more perfectly than in this movie. I am not saying the movie was perfect, it seemed to unneededly drag a bit toward the end but that is just being picky. This was a witty movie filled with humor and heart. The boy in the film is quite good and I always enjoy Mr. Grant--he is unique in the way he presents himself. The movie causes one to think, about life, love, and all that is between: the things that are really important. Good movie, great cast, well done. A"
tt0276751,221,"Just finished watching this, had to see it twice you know. It was quite a treat. I don't like every movie I see like some people so while I was watching it I said to myself this is genuine, funny and not contrived. You know at the end things will be ok but it's getting there that works. Hugh Grant was wonderfully believeable as Will, an easy, relatively happy guy who doesn't want to deal with a heavy relationship or someone else's problems, until he meets Marcus. I hope we see more of this fine actor in future films. He was like Oliver Twist of the millennium. Marcus taught Will a few things and vica versa. Loved the relationship between them. I laughed out loud at some of Will's delivery about life while caring about Marcus's optimistic take on life. It's hard enough to deal with school problems at any age but also dealing with his mother's depression makes things unbearable, but Marcus perseveres.

Will finally realizes what kind of life Marcus has had and starts to see things from another viewpoint. Loved the characters including Fiona, Marcus's hippie self-absorbed mother. Leave it to the British to come up with a humorous film about suicide, finding one's way and relationships. It's a touching film without the sappiness like Billy Elliott. Loved the soundtrack too and the scene on the stage is worth the whole film. Imagine a 13 year old kid who gets up on a school stage to sing for his mother.

The point is clear everyone needs backup you know."
tt0276751,222,"First of all, this movie is an excellent portrayal of human nature. Although the main character is self centered, ""An Island"" as he puts it, his honesty about his own shallowness is great. It's worth watching over and over again to catch all the clever jokes and other lines in the movie that were missed the first time. Not that the plot of the movie isn't clear, it's just so loaded with great and obviously well thought out detail that you not only MUST see it, but you MUST see it several times.

One last thing worth mentioning about the movie is that the music in the movie is really good. It turns what is a really good movie into a masterpiece."
tt0276751,223,"I rented this film because I was in the mood for a girls movie, love comedy with no brains. However, I was wrong. About a boy was not shallow, empty love comedy. The plot was not as predictable as you might think. It actually had something to say, something that was very much indeed worth saying. Just like Jon Bon Jovi said: No man is an island."
tt0276751,224,"The movie adaptation of ""About a Boy"" was a pleasant surprise to me, coming on the heels of the dreadful Americanized version of ""High Fidelity"". ""About a Boy"" succeeds in every area where ""High Fidelity"" failed; it not only faithfully recaptures the tone of the novel, but expands upon it to make a very good movie.

Possibly the largest problem with ""High Fidelity"" was that it was adapted to an American setting, with American characters. I don't believe either setting is objectively better, but both of Hornby's books are extremely British. The characters, the dialogue, the settings, all work because of their original setting. When making ""High Fidelity"" the filmmakers seemed to think they could solve this problem with name actors and by cranking up the volume (a typical problem with Americanizations). It just didn't work.

""About a Boy"" succeeds because it is low-volume. It is a very low-key study of a small set of characters and their relationships. I've never been a fan of Hugh Grant - the nod and tick, the self-conscious stammering - but he does an excellent job in this role. In fact, all of the actors are quite good. And the director does an admirable job of not allowing the story to become sappy or manipulative.

Perhaps the biggest difference between the two adapations is that in this one there is no talking to the camera, a conceit that has become pervasive and annoying. There are voiceovers (as there is a lot of inner monologue that must be explained) but they do not detract from the experience.

It is odd that one can spend so long talking about the faults of something they dislike, but explaining what one likes is so difficult. This movie simply works; it is a complete, self-contained universe and is very effective. I highly recommend it. Since the book and the movie do have some differences, I would also recommend reading the book."
tt0276751,225,"Yes finally a film thats worthy of the book from which it's derided from! The great irony about 'About a boy' is that owning up to liking Hugh Grant is as about as cool as the Sahara, yet here he plays the very cool Will and pulls it off effortlessly. At first we see him as an arogant b****rd - albeit a very funny arogant b****rd. And then Marcus, the boy of the title, and the total opposite to Will - Very uncool, unpopular, yet original, invades Will's life and actually manages to give Will's life some meaning, whilst Will in his own way gives Marcus the confidence to face up to his own problems. The performances are great, the humour very funny, and for once the moving scenes are moving yet not overly done (Billy Elliot, another British comedy, p***ed me off with the way it seemed to try so hard to make us blub), and is a thoroughly enjoyable way of spending an hour and a half. Really there is good drama, a few scenes that will genuinly have you clutching your sides, and though you'll know from the beginning that the plot will tie up nicely for everyone at the end, this will still give you a warm heart and a goofy grin slapped all over your face long after the credits roll - go cheer yourself up and see this movie."
tt0276751,226,
tt0276751,227,"A very complete movie. It has all the good things I always require of either a drama, a romance, or a comedy. It's very exciting to find that a movie like this has been done nowadays.

The only thing I disliked is that it could have been done suitable for all audiences if it didn't have some brief strong language. I always think that a perfect movie must be suitable for everybody (except in a very few exceptions), as the classic film makers showed us decades ago.

Regarding photography and art direction, it has some interior scenes which I found very beautiful and inspiring, specially those in restaurants.

By the way, if you have the DVD, don't miss the suppressed scenes. It has one which makes you understand the Ellie character (Nat Gastiain Tena) a lot better. Unfortunately they suppressed it from the movie because they considered it competed against the main characters relationships.

I voted it 9/10. I think it's a bit too high for my usual ratings, but the nowadays lack of this kind of movies makes me feel obligated to vote it 9/10. If we were in the 50s, I'd probably rate it a bit lower."
tt0276751,228,"This was a very strange moral dramatic comedy. Or a moralistic comedic drama? However you'd like to call it, it's a great movie. Hugh Grant comes out repeating a bit of the character that he did in `Nine Months' only this time his character is even shallower and the plot is much better. I think what most Americans need to understand when they watch a British comedy is that (despite the fact that they speak English) their sense of humor is a little different. It's more understated than the average American humor is so I can see how some Americans found this film to be slow and boring. If you need the wacky antics of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey in order to laugh, this movie probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate nuances, facial expressions and innuendos you'll like the movie as much as I did. It's very well directed and the characters' personalities are truly captured in a very real way.

That's not all. It's not JUST a funny movie. Behind the shallowness and eccentricity of the people in the show there is also depression, disgust, hope and even a moral. How many movies will give you all that in an hour and a half? Not many. Even though Grant does a fine job in the leading role the strength of the film is in the entire cast. Marcus (the boy character) is wonderfully honest and sometimes blunt, his mother is off the wall and the kids at school are horribly monstrous. You really feel as though this is true to life. It is a very modern story of what families are made up of these days: blood relatives, step relatives and friends.

If you're still reading this comment, I think that you out to see the movie. It's definitely worth the few bucks you'll spend to take it home for a few days."
tt0276751,229,"it has its corny moments, granted, and it's too bad that it's based on a book, as it would have been a rockin' screenplay if it had been written originally for the screen. however, nick hornby's books usually make better films than those with original screenplays, so i'll deal.

i haven't read the book, so i don't know how much of the dialogue is taken directly from it, but these are some damn good lines in this movie, and hugh grant's delivery of them restored my faith in him as an actor (let's pretend 'two weeks notice' never happened, shall we?) and will stop me from associating him with crappy movies like 'nine months'.

seriously, this movie is funny. if you want to be on the floor, worse-than-being-tickled laughing, watch this. it's not through the whole film, but as soon as you see the scenes that evoke this reaction, you'll know exactly what i'm talking about. i won't give them away here, though. watch it.

oh, and the casting -- effing brilliant. really.

the more movies i watch, the stupider the setups get. that's why i still watch crappy big-budget hollywood films -- to check out what tard-o setup is there to get around to the ridiculous plot. example: 'what women want'. mel gibson gets electrocuted by a hair dryer in the bathtub and doesn't die, but instead wakes up with the ability to hear women's thoughts. kind of like 'groundhog day' but way worse. can you please insult my intelligence a little more? pleeease?

point being, 'about a boy' doesn't do this. it's feasible, yet quirky, yet not annoyingly quirky, which makes it human, which makes it relatable, which makes us like it.

but for the love of god, did they have to end it with a freeze frame?"
tt0276751,230,"Wow, what an excellent screenplay, with crisp, witty, and timely monologues and dialogues! I never imagined this film would be such a delight to watch. Hugh Grant just gets better and better as an actor who seems so real in his roles that you wonder how can do it. The young boy is superb in his role --we really do feel for him and his tragic surroundings. And all the women in this film put in top notch performances. But the transformation of Hugh Grant's character--from one of emptiness to one of caring and feeling--is the movie's triumphant success. Bravo!"
tt0276751,231,"You can't help but like Marcus. That's a given from the beginning of the film. You also can't help liking Will, and you can't help thereafter watching the two of them enrich each other's lives. This is a film of importance if only because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's just straight story-telling from two distinct and authentic narrative voices; Will's and Marcus'. Now, this is a film which takes a subject as serious as a mother attempting suicide, and makes it a comfortable moment for comedy. There's nothing funny about the event, oh no, but the characters involved can't help not feeling awful the rest of the movie. Marcus is extremely proactive in helping those around him, and his circle of friends slowly grows. Will, on the other hand, is who this film becomes all about. We know Marcus is always going to have a straight outlook on things, no matter what life throws him. It's up to Will to change, and it's outstanding how he can come out of his shell without sacrificing his coolness. What sets About a Boy apart from other films about cool people learning to let down their guard and love somebody, is that in the end they've sacrificed some of their ""cool-ness"". Will is always a charmer, right to the end, but he manages to really change, and you can't help but marvel at the effortlessness. In the end, it's all about how Will is able to see Marcus as ""cool"" too."
tt0276751,232,"If you are looking for a contemporary, yet unconventional fairy tale, then you should see this film. 'About a Boy' is the story of a middle-aged man with no direction whose life suddenly changes with the introduction of a young, eccentric young boy. This is a film about self-discovery and human relationships. There is romance, a bit of suspense, and lots of humor. (A-)"
tt0276751,233,"It's a British comedy, not the best one I've seen but it fairly good. And honestly this is the best role, in my opinion, Hugh Grant has done, he doesn't come off as a neurotic Englishman(why does he always have to play these roles), though Will(Hugh Grant) is neurotic, he is a boy. And that makes all the difference. The others actors, Toni Collette(Fiona), Nicholas Hoult(Marcus) and Rachel Weisz(Rachel) is also quite wonderful, Nicholas Hoult is so cool as Marcus. These actors makes this film cosy, warm and fun. But still there is something missing, despite a good story and good lines. And that all the film is, good, not amazing, not wonderful, just good and bit cute."
tt0276751,234,"Great little film and refreshingly short. As usual (for Nick Hormby) it is set in his beloved north London, plus some stuff in what must be Shoreditch and Smithfield. Why is Will (Hugh Grant) always driving through the meat market? Is that a metaphor for his pulling lifestyle? Is that what SPAT is? Of course (in real life) Smithfield is about to be relocated, and the old market turned into a consumer haven presumably, probably along the lines of Covent Garden. About time, too.

Actually, you could call this entire film About Time Too, as Will must finally enter normal, family life.

Nick Hornby has done some excellent stuff (if you forgive him the Arsenal stuff - not half as angst-ridden as supporting Chelsea), though it's a bit like Teach Yourself Screenwriting what with all the classic character transformation. Even the hippy-depressive Fiona (Toni Collette) ends up liking McDonalds though you knew it would be too much for her and Will to end up together, hence the Amnesty International connection. Is this the first time that Amnesty has been linked with romance? Maybe the theme of the film is the final amnesty on Will's years of selfish singlehood.

And the U2 song! Right now, I'm listening to Mandela Day - 'it was 25 years ago to this day'. Will is 38 and it's 25 years since he entered puberty and about time that he became a couple, not a single man forever. They could have used that song."
tt0276751,235,"This year a movie called about a boy came out. Well the title says it all. The movie is simple about a boy. It seems to me that in every movie Hugh Grant plays himself. I felt that the boy was bettter than him. The movie couldnt figure out wether it wanted to be a comedy or a drama. Hugh Grant gives on of the worst performaces ever. The only person that got me intrested was Rachel Weisz , who has the uncanny ability to pick bad movies and act well in it. I got to the point where i wanted to hang myself because the movie was so boring. What was the producers thining whne they decided to make this movie geeezzee!. I hope that a movie like this ill never be made again."
tt0276751,236,"""About a Boy""

Hugh Grant has been considered for the next James Bond according to a certain film magazine. Well, I for one forsee the downfall of James Bond as we know it. The considerations are a black actor, Hugh Grant, Christian Bale, and Jude Law, not to mention another black actor: Will Smith. Yes, you read that right. Apart from black actors--really, Bond being black?--Hugh Grant is probably the worst choice for Bond. But as far as romantic comedies go, he's not that bad.

""About a Boy"" is about a childish, whiny, selfish, greedy, miserable young man (Grant) who finds that single parents are best for dating. So he enters into a single parents group, where he proceeds to tell the lie that he has a child. Soon, he is going out with a woman who believes he has a son--who introduces him to a friend's pre-teen, named Marcus. Marcus' mother attempts to commit suicide, and it screws up the kid, so he starts to go over to Grant's home every day after school. Grant eventually admits he has no child, and the woman he had been going out with pretty much dumps him. But Marcus keeps coming over every day. Eventually Grant starts to help Marcus out by trying to help him fit into his school better; he buys him ""trainers,"" CDs, a personal CD player, etc. And then Grant's character meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), who he proceeds to tell that he has a son, for certain reasons. So eventually Rachel wants to see his son. Trouble. And then Grant gets Marcus to pose as his son while he gets personal with Rachel. Trouble solved. For now.

""About a Boy"" is based on the bestselling novel by Nicholas Hornby, author of ""High Fidelity""--which was turned into a film with John Cusack that took place in Chicago instead of London--and a few other hits. I've never read his work, but I think it's been done justice for the most part.

""About a Boy"" is a good comedy, with some funny British humor. It was good, but not great. I enjoyed ""Notting Hill"" more, to tell you the truth. I think ""About a Boy"" took quite a long time getting to where it was going. Ranking in at about two hours, that's a bit long for a romantic comedy, especially when the love interest is introduced an hour and nine minutes into the film. The setup itself takes over an hour to establish. Many, many scenes could have been cut to make room for more time after Grant meets Rachel. But instead, the filmmakers take so much time building up to that point, that by the time they finally arrive to the romance part, they have about fifty minutes to deal with a LOT of things that happen. Perhaps that is why the last hour seems so rushed and thrown together compared to the beginning.

But it's still a pretty funny film. I'm not especially fond of Hugh Grant, but his romantic comedies can be pretty good--I really enjoyed ""Notting Hill,"" and I don't like Roberts, either. ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"" was also a good British comedy. And there's no doubting ""About a Boy"" is good, but it's not great, and a lot of scenes could and should have been cut. Isn't it ironic that I think one of the deleted scenes on the DVD should have been left in the film?

3.5/5 Stars--or 7/10 Stars--

John Ulmer"
tt0276751,237,"Hugh Grant is the only thing holding this picture together. Not his best performance, perhaps his worst. Supporting actors are likewise devoid of any magic. This film is a sleeper - too bad, the story line has promise, but I've got to say this is one of the worst films I've seen. It just never seems to get above ""depressing."" I'm disappointed with the marketing hype it has received. Clearly skewed to deceive.

If you were ever contemplating suicide - don't watch this film, it'll put you over the edge; more a drama than a comedy."
tt0276751,238,"I can find no word to describe this film other than charming. Written by the living master of the ""men behaving badly, but trying to get better"" style, Nick Hornby (High Fidelity); this film introduces us to Will, played by Hugh Grant. A loafer, living off the royalties of a popular Christmas tune written by his father, Will has created the ultimate bachelor life of temporary relationships and comfortable solitude. After an odd revelation, he begins to pursue single mothers for his romantic flings. This brings him into contact with twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and his troubled, suicidal mother Fiona, expertly played by the versatile Toni Collette. Together, Nicholas and Will help each other to become the men they want to be.

This story could have been a predictable retelling of the innumerable romantic comedies that it resembles. However, the courage not to sugar coat the characters makes this film one of the better films of 2002. The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz, better known for their sophomoric hit comedy American Pie, demonstrate that they are a new force is humor films. The style of the film is straight forward and unremarkable, but it is this very clean style that allows a good cast to tell a story of charming humanity.

Hugh Grant, long known for his ""English Fop"" roles continues to grow as an actor, like he did in Bridget Jones's Diary, to being able to play roles of depth and subtlety. Newcomer Nicholas Hoult gives a remarkable performance. I often cringe when watching what qualifies a child acting in films following in the wake of the rise of the dreadful Macaulay Culkin. However, Nicholas Hoult is an adult and professional actor in the body of a twelve year old boy. Finally, Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense) proves once again, that she can take on characters with such expertness and skill that she is one of the film world's undiscovered diamonds.

Now, this is not a ""deep"" film that illustrates some great revelation about the state of mankind. Nor is the script such that you won't know how this whole story will work out. But between the witty dialog and good performances, it will certainly leave you with a smile."
tt0276751,239,"Think about it. Instead of going to support groups and lying about illnesses like Ed Norton did to combat his boredom in ""Fight Club,"" Hugh Grant lies about being a father and goes to a single parent's support group to pick up hot single moms and cure his boredom. These are symptoms of the same disease. No man is an island. In the end of ""Fight Club"" Ed Norton realizes that no amount of consumer goods, cathartic violence, mayhem, and bloody male bonding can make up for the fact that what a man really needs is a good woman. He tells Marla at the end of the film while watching buildings explode ""You met me at a very strange point in my life."" Likewise, in the end of ""About a Boy"" Hugh Grant realizes that no amount of material things and solitary comforts can take the place of the friendships and meaningful romantic relationships that are needed to live a happy life. Both of these men were living in compartmental, single serving, units of time, worlds that were empty and void of meaning.

Okay, the ""Fight Club"" comparisons aside, this was a surprisingly charming and astute romantic comedy with a biting wit and deft sentimental touch. I hadn't been this pleasantly pleased by such a lightweight film since Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous."" This is by far Hugh Grant's best performance to date, and this is a rare comedy that has some emotional depth and uplifting things to say about human relationships. What makes this even more surprising is that this came from the Weitz brothers, who previously gave us the only marginally funny and excruciatingly immature ""American Pie"" films. This is the perfect romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies. A real charmer all around."
tt0276751,240,"About a Boy is not only about a boy, it's about all of us  everyone who hazards out upon the dark waters of a relationship. And it's about the fate one embraces whenever a person trades his or her precious freedom for the claims a relationship makes on one's privacy. Will, the main character, is an archetypal man in this respect: he wants to remain an island, the lord of his own personal domain, while also having relationships with women  if only for sex.

Unfortunately for Will, that isn't possible. Why? Speaking as a man who's been through the pea patch a few times, it's because women make the rules. There's no negotiation, appeasement, or qualification. It's better to accept it without murmur. But, valiant man that Will is, he tries his best to beat the odds, to be the only man in human history who has ever achieved both his freedom, and a steady supply of feminine relationships, simultaneously. I must say, I admired his tenacity. At one point of the movie, I thought he'd cracked the nut. Completely by chance, he accepts a date with a single mom. It's everything he ever hoped for: passionate sex, a regular ego massage, and an easy breakup. Bingo! He discovered the mother lode!

But then, a number of chance occurrences intervene to totally change his fate  the fate of being an island, which he chose for himself. And just like real life, chance events show themselves as fate's very own calling card: everything that occurs of necessity, is expected, or is the product of a person's imagination, is powerless to reach our souls. Chance is the Janus face of fate.

What I love about this movie is its absurdity: Chance in the absolute presents itself to Will in the guise of a twelve-year old boy. And it's this wild incongruity that really gives this film it's pithy but warm sense of humor. The compulsive fornicator becomes a surrogate father to a fatherless boy, remaining an island, but joining up with an archipelago."
tt0276751,241,"Hugh Grant shines in this tailor-made vehicle that plays to his strengths. Grant is an actor who has to work hard with what he's got and his ability to clarify emotion with a minimum of facial expression or vocal inflection is impressive; he reveals a lot without giving too much away. (Tom Cruise, take note.) Here he stars (freed, finally, from the yoke of having to submerge himself alongside such aggressive egos as Julia Roberts and Renee Zellweger) as an independently wealthy bachelor forced to grow up when a desperate twelve-year-old boy (an endearing Nicholas Hoult) enters his life, enlisting him to help the boy's troubled mother (Toni Colette). It's clear that Grant without question is committed to his role and this infectious attitude carries over to the rest of the cast and the directors, brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, and what you have is a delicately balanced, elegantly crafted studio presentation that entertains even when it messes up--which the screenplay (by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges) and the pointed camerawork does quite frequently. (It equates independence with unhappiness and emphasizes conformity over idiosyncrasy.) Still, it's a successful hybrid of dark British wit and seriousness with care taken to provide a very satisfying conclusion."
tt0276751,242,"While Hugh Grant always puts in an excellent performance (Bridget Jones' Diary, Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral) in this movie he seems to come closest to showing the 'real' Hugh Grant -- one that is not only charming, but has an edge as well. I highly recommend it."
tt0276751,243,"I must hand it to the writers of this film--they were willing to strike out to new ground. Unfortunately, their mixture of comedy and drama didn't settle well on the stomach.

I felt as if I were watching two separate movies, a formulaic-but-amusing British comedy, and a disturbing drama of depression, suicide, and childhood angst. I can only compliment the writers who could manage to blend these together at all, and cajole the audience into laughing five seconds after a very disturbing and traumatic scene. But that very talent made the film very unsettling.

The climax of the film was weak and a little unnerving, but it wasn't the plot that I found enjoyable. My good memories of this film are in the small moments, the little jokes and clever lines. Perhaps that was the best that could be hoped for from the beginning."
tt0276751,244,"I liked this movie!! I thought it was sweet without being sickingly sappy...and it was downright hilarious! I was cracking up throughout the duration. It was slightly predictable, but it was still great fun."
tt0276751,245,"Here we've got a movie by the creative team behind ""High Fidelity"". I'm glad to see they haven't lost their touch. Once again, we get great characterization and instantly quotable dialogue. Be prepared to wince in empathy with the long-suffering title character."
tt0276751,246,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Nick Hornby´s book was absolutely fantastic, and the other movie based on his book ""High Fidelity"", starring John Cusack, was great,unfortunately this movie isn´t as good. The ending of the book and the ending of the film are totally different and also a lot of Hornby´s somewhat dark and sharp humour has been ""smoothened"" which is really a shame. Still, the first half of the movie, which is more true to the book, is really good, and Hugh Grant is fantastic! He really saves the movie. I never thought of him as much of an actor before, but he is marvellous as ""Will"". Defenitly a movie worth watching but can´t give it more than 7/10 because probably only 50% of the books great potential has been used."
tt0276751,247,"This was a pretty good film. I wasn't planning on seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Hugh Grant is great, as are all of the actors. The movie was funny, touching, sad and above all, a great film. I'd definitely rent it again, maybe even go see it at the theaters again (if it were still out anyways)."
tt0276751,248,"I thought this was an excellent film that portrayed a cynical man's journey from being a self centered example of a shallow human being to a caring teacher and mentor to an adolescent boy. This film represented the importance of friendship and the rewards of close relationships.

I normally do not have a lot of respect for Hugh Grant as an actor but this film changed my opinion of him.

Watch this film!"
tt0276751,249,
tt0276751,250,"""About A Boy"" is a comedy that reminds me a lot of a Wes Anderson film but it was directed by the boys from ""American Pie"". It turns that really good comedic director can make both smart funny and stupid funny films are worth viewing. There are ten reasons ""About A Boy"" is worth a trip to the video store.

1) Paul and Chris Weitz did a superior job of directing the movie. They are very versatile when it comes to the material they choose. 2) Hugh Grant had the best comedic performance of the year. It was also the best of his career. 3) Nicholas Hoult was extraordinary as the rather observant and somewhat smart-alecky Marcus. 4) The writing was is definitely Oscar-worthy. The proof is in the nomination it received. 5) The music is really good. Badly Drawn Boy was an interesting choice and the songs that were crafted were of superior quality. 6) The duck scene is a classic. 7) Toni Collette plays a great mother. This is her best role since ""The Sixth Sense"". 8) The story took an interesting twist on the child teaching adult formula and formed it into something palatable. 9) The cinematography is riveting and almost unreal. 10) The conclusion was nice to view and not sappy.

I think film is the best of the last year that I have actually seen. Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors and I hope he continues to find roles that go against that romantic lead typecast he seems to be labeled with. ""About A Boy"" gets 10 out of 10! Here ends my rant!"
tt0276751,251,
tt0276751,252,"My sister and rented About A Boy and we really didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to find that we truly loved it, so much so that we rented it again. Hugh Grant has never played such a great character. I've never seen him so charming even when his character is the exact opposite. The character Marcus couldn't have been more perfectly cast. The movie has real heart. It's sad at times but mostly it's brilliant and funny. The singing scene is my favorite. Hugh is just fabulous in it! I'm gonna buy the dvd real soon. See it, I'm sure you'll love it too!"
tt0276751,253,"I recently saw this movie, and I must say that I loved it. I think it had a great plot and the actors did very well. Hugh Grant does a great job playing the high-class guy who just wants to meet women, so he does that by joining SPAT, single parents alone together. This role he did, I think, was better than what he played in Bridget Jones.

At first, the two narrations between Will and the boy was a bit confusing, but it gave the movie an interesting twist to hear their thoughts. But as the two characters met, the narrations let up a bit.

Personally, I wouldn't mind watching this movie again. I recommend it to anyone in search of a good movie"
tt0276751,254,"this was an adorable movie, the just concept of it was great and so was hugh grant and the kid, it was a cute movie and it was just great, i just saw it last night, it was soooooooooo cute, i wanna see it again soon!!!!! its appropriate for all ages and its just great!"
tt0276751,255,"I must confess that I expected the usual lightweight Hugh Grant romantic comedy when I rented this movie. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with a story that gently mocked the self-absorbed character that Mr. Grant usually portrays. This story of a lonely man ultimately discovering personal success by making meaningful connections with a cast of interesting characters is a worthwhile parable for those who have sought to isolate themselves from the world. I can't honestly say that I would watch this movie several more times, but I can give it an above average rating."
tt0276751,256,"""About A Boy"" is one of the best movies I've seen recently. It is a genuinely touching and hilarious story of an immature man who finally learns to care about something other than himself. I liked Hugh Grant as the shallow Will, and Nicolaus Hoult was charming as Marcus, the boy who helps Will to grow up. If you rent this movie, I strongly suggest the DVD version, which contains an assortment of amusing music videos that expand upon the ""duck incident."""
tt0276751,257,"Finally, Hugh Grant proves he can act. Rather than his typecast stammering, oh-I'm-so-shy-and-so-cute British fop, here he is a shallow cad, leading a selfish spoiled life and giving nothing in return.

He stumbles onto the ""perfect scam"", pretending to be a single father in order to seduce lonely, vulnerable single mothers. But when a date goes awry, he is sought after as a father-figure by a ""loser""-type 12 year old boy. Of course, it's an old story: he rejects the kid, is grudgingly won over, and they both end up growing as a result of the relationship. About a Boy is actually about two boys.

But while the story is cliche, the mastery is in the details. Nicholas Hoult is good, and doesn't play the stereotypical sappy kid who's more mature than the adults; he's messed up. Hugh Grant plays the part well, not a Walter Matthau type-grouch, but someone who is not indecent, just astonished that other people actually have feelings and needs. The dialogue is sharp, Nick Hornby's books are terrific material for movies."
tt0276751,258,"I didn't expect to like it. I figured it would be a typical sappy chick flick. But it was funny and very well done. It was sort of predictable at the end. But I wanted entertainment, so that was ok. I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
tt0276751,259,I personally loved this movie! Hugh Grant is fantastic and so is the actor that plays Toni Collette's son. I just rented the disc last night and now I can't wait to buy it on DVD. This is one you could watch again. It's a keeper! Enjoy!
tt0276751,260,"Another great story from Nick Hornby. After seeing High Fidelity, I could not wait to see this movie and thankfully it didn't disappoint. Casting Hugh Grant was genius as he seems to be the quintessential British man. He's a great actor and I liked how he wasn't his usual bumbling self that he usually plays. The kid in this movie was quite talented as well. I'm really glad they cast Rachel Weisz in this movie, she's quite lovely. A bit underused perhaps. All in all, a great story, great acting and great cast."
tt0276751,261,"Better than average Hugh Grant movie. He manages to be completely shallow, yet you still like him. Liked the supporting cast. Acting was pretty good. About what you would expect for this type movie."
tt0276751,262,"What do Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Mel Gibson, Elia Kazan, Sydney Pollack have in common? These are all actors who won Oscars for their direction of a film. There's a great difference between directors and filmmakers. There are those such as Ridley Scott who can stage a great spectacle with thousands or extras and gigantic sets, lavish costumes but ignore directing the actors or the characters' intent.

Two things that they teach student directors at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts are (1) Don't downplay to your audience, and (2) Never underestimate your audience's intelligence. The last few films I've seen, including ""About A Boy"", ""Eye See You"" (D-Tox) and ""Signs"", I've waited until the DVD came out to see the full versions and the things that the director or editor thought that we, the audience, didn't need to see or else we couldn't understand or wouldn't appreciate the footage that they decided to crop off and leave on the cutting room floor.

Hell, the movie is only 101 minutes including the opening and closing credits. Ten more minutes of the deleted scenes (shown on the DVD) would NOT have bored us and probably would have ""filled in the gaps"" on a lot of scenes and fine acting that theatrical audiences who paid seven bucks never got or will get to see. This director was not a young kid, but so often these new directors fresh out of film school with a great propensity for angles, camera angles, CG, effects, and etc. forget that sometimes even the best actors need some direction. These young directors have no concept of directing actors. They know how to set up a scene to shoot and if it doesn't meet their quality of ""filmmaking"", well, just delete it. They think it will bore the audience.

Movies should be more about storytelling not just visual film shooting. No director should direct until he knows something about acting or scriptwriting. He thinks a scene is too long and we, the audience, will not care for long static scenes of acting. God! Have they never been to the theatre and seen a three act play with only two characters and one set?...And yet something this simple can hold an audience's attention for two and a half hours! ""About A Boy"" is a wonderful film. 'Tis a pity, for it could have been a greater and much better film if the deleted scenes were included.

The best example I can think to prove my point is the film version of ""The Fantasticks"" which ran for 30 years Off-Broadway. Most moviegoers have either seen it or acting in a production of it. The movie was so bad it wouldn't even open in the theaters! But then you buy the DVD and find that the deleted scenes and songs cut from the film run longer than the actual film that was released. I would invite you to view the DVD of ""About A Boy"" and see one of Hugh Grant's finest, restrained performances, but then go to the ""Special Features"" and view the deleted scenes and listen to the flimsy excuses the filmmakers say as why they cut the scenes. Too bad they didn't go to the AADA and learn the two basic fundamentals about direction!"
tt0276751,263,"Although the movie was interpreted differently than i would have imagined, i found AAB remarkably good. Grant turns in one of the best performances of his career as Will, and Hoult, Collette, and the rest of the cast are also very believable. A great movie for all ages, AAB deserves to be nominated for a bunch of awards in the upcoming award season."
tt0276751,264,"I really hope this movie gets an Oscar nomination because it was so well made. Hugh Grant plays Will, a 38 year old bachelor who has never worked a day in his life. Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus, a 12 year old kid who needs some escape after witnessing his mother attempted suicide. Apart, they are lost individuals. But after a series of meetings and a little scheming by Marcus to hook Will up with his mother played by Toni Collette, both find themselves needing the other. Their worlds are rocked and soon, Will finds himself unable to continue his bachelor life as before based on units of 1 or 30 mins. When he meets Rachel, played by Rachel Weisz, Will is actually ashamed of being the person he was and continued his lie about being a single father because he now cares what other people think of him. The film ends with Will spending Christmas dinner with Rachel and Will and his mum. And this is all because of a boy. Although the movie is a dramatic-comedy if there is such a thing, it tends to move slowly and we do see their relationship developing over periods of probably months. Hugh Grant was marvelous and gave probably the performance of his career as of date. The production was good, the cast was superb, and the story-telling wasn't boring, albeit slow. I give this film 7 out of 10 stars."
tt0276751,265,"It's usually hard to find a smart romantic comedy, especially since the Academy Awards have snubbed movies in this genre, and with good reason. Most often, people fall in love hastily without the believability associated with the development of the characters. Furthermore, many screenplays are dreadfully trite with common one-liners that could be used in a variety of other romances.

This, however, is not the case with About a Boy. Intelligently casted, Hugh Grant is the highlight of the movie, portraying a playboy with poised and confidence, while being a scholar of the apprehensions of committing to a substantial relationship from the insights of the young, remarkable, and precocious Nicholas Hoult in this wonderful coming of age story. The script is well written and suited best for Grant, who is should be worthy of an Oscar nomination, while the supporting ensemble of Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz make the acting quite enjoyable. The movie is highly entertaining and beautifully made, with the subtle and clever usage of comedy by directors Paul and Chris Weitz, which captivates and engages the audience, making this film a great feel good movie and one of the best movies of 2002."
tt0276751,266,"As the book, About A Boy is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Nick Hornby is simply magnificent in his published works and his films bring the books to life in the third dimension. Wait for it, yes, this IS a good performance from Hugh Grant, never thought I'd say it, but I did *off to confession for me*! The film is not predictable, it is extreme, yes the hair cut is awful, but thats the point. The lad is clearly odd....the point of the film would be missed if the kid was ""normal"". Saw the film at the cinema, bought it on DVD the day it came out. Badly Drawn Boys musical talents make the film outstanding. If you want a night in with some smiles and a few laughs along the way then see this film."
tt0276751,267,"Once in a while, such a rare DVD comes along that will make you stay the whole screening even if you're dying for the loo.

""About a Boy"" is such a film. Seriously. Seeing as I had absolutely no time to see the film on its original theatrical release, I rented it on DVD and boy oh boy did I kick myself afterwards, for I have missed the communal laughter and warmth that seeing this film with a cinematic audience would have brought me.

There must be so many other reviews here at IMDB that I will not bother detailing the plotline (slack!). However, the comedy of the transformation of, Will, the main character, from an insanely self-centered man-child to a man who is willing to give up all of his dignity for a child's happiness (won't give away anything here!) is surprisingly well directed by the directors of the original gross out teen comedy series ""American Pie"", the Weitz brothers. The directors must have crossed seas here because the film is delightfully funny in a subtle way (as British comedies are).

The acting is flawless. Led by Hugh Grant (Will), whom some comment is the modern Cary Grant (well, both of them being British and all), is a champion player of the romantic comedy. His delivery is subtle, classy and he looks extremely natural; New comer Nicholas Hoult gives a sincere and honest performance as the young boy Marcus; Toni Collette, whom doesn't seem to ever give a bad performance, is touching as well as funny playing Marcus' suicidal mother Fiona; and Rachel Weisz cameos late in the film as Will's first real love, Rachel.

Underscoring the film with effective, originally composed contempoary music that suits the moods of the movie well is the artist ""Badly Drawn Boy"".

""About a Boy"" is a warm, honest, sincere, and genuninely laugh-out-loud film which will really make you think about how you live your life.

10 points!"
tt0276751,268,"I've read a couple reviews on this movie by other users, and I must agree, it's completely predictable. Don't watch it if you expect some thrilling tag line, there isn't one. Grant plays the same role as ever, with some funny moments. This is no Shakespeare, but it's definitely fun to watch if you have nothing better to do. As for the boy actor, he's no Joel Osment, but he can do. Thankfully the script flows well, with quite frequent quips. Won't make you roll on the floor laughing, but you'll definitely have a laugh.

Not in my DVD collection, but worth a try."
tt0276751,269,"The movie is a feel good movie with loads of laughs. It does get a bit boring in the middle, but it is worth it for the end of the movies is very funny and very original. A must see for anyone who likes humorous movies with a bit of seriousness."
tt0276751,270,"Erm, very surprised, really liked it, as usual it was very different from the book (Like most hollywood films, ie The beach, Hi-fidelity...blah blah) but as a film in it's own rights I loved it....also nordlander_emma erm, I think u are scary, not to sure what happens in sweeden, but comments like anyone who has a relationship with a child is a sex pervert is extreme and very sad....hope you were kidding."
tt0276751,271,"Ahhh, Nick Hornby, one of the modern bestsellers? And a second movie made by his book.

After reading High Fidelity book and seeing movie, i was very disappointed. Book was great, while movie was just another ""Sex in the city"" episode and another Hollywood crap (3 out of 10). That's why I was a little sceptic about Hornby's next dramatization About a boy.

And, boy, was I wrong. Firstly, Hugh Grant was a great pick for a 38-old boy and he did his act great. Secondly, the story...well, filled with laughable moments and sad ones without being ""Hollywood emotionally"", leading to expected ending.

All in all, About a boy is one of this year pleasant surprises in a flood of Hollywood flops and certainly, this year one of my favorites. Thats' why a high rate of

7 out of 10."
tt0276751,272,"I had to comment just to debunk the last comment left. To assume that all men in real life would actually molest (or worse) a young boy they are close to is laughably absurd.

This was a kind, heartwarming story that was made all the better by the simple fact that it all rang true and because it felt real.

Men who molest kids are still in the minority, thankfully."
tt0276751,273,"Will is the almost middle-aged man who is living a sugar coated life on the fortune of his father's only number one song. Will thinks he's happy until he meets a boy...

Marcus is a pre-teen boy who lives with his manic-depressed mother in suburban London. Marcus is the school joke and is very unhappy until he meets a man...

About A Boy is a heart warming story of a boy and a man missing something from their lives, until they meet when everything changes.

Excellent performances by Hugh Grant (who gives a wonderful performance as Will) Nicholas Holt as the boy, Marcus, Toni Collette as his mother and Rachel Weiss as Grant's love interest support a well written story that is not coated in any way and is realistic even to the very conclusion which is still a happy one.

From a score of 10, About A Boy is 9.5."
tt0276751,274,"I read the book about a week before I saw the movie, I found the book to be quite enjoyable, a little too strong on the language, and the ending was a little too strong (thank God they change it in the movie), but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Then I saw the movie, I liked how they tell the story from two different points of view, from Will and from Marcus. They did something similar in the book, only the author narrated, and it was one chapter from Marcus's point of view, and the next from Will's point of view. Hugh Grant fits perfectly in the role of Will Freeman, and young Nicholas Hoult gives an excellent performance as Marcus. Toni Collette also gave a great performance as Marcus's suicide mother, who in my opinion, was a little to annoying in the book. I was surprised that the same directors who did American Pie (which I haven't seen, but i believe is gross) could do a a comedy which is a little more serious, and less gross, in such an excellent way. 10/10"
tt0276751,275,
tt0276751,276,"A distinguished film critic said once that you should forget a film is taken from a book and consider what you're watching in itself. The problem for the one who actually makes the film is quite different, of course. For this film (and also for High Fidelity) the problem seems to be how to convey Hornby's flavour on film. And the solution is always the same: voice off. In High Fidelity it wasn't off actually, for the actor spoke to camera, but that's just a trick. In this case, we hear characters thoughts in first person (in the book is on third: quite a difference) and that's where all the fun comes from. Once again, it's Hornby who deserves credit: and though I've liked and laughed a lot, it seems to me this About A Boy on screen lacks something to be a good film and not a good transposition. Hugh Grant is better than usual, good casting, good pace. A big flaw: the bit with Hugh with guitar is cheap slapstick mixed with an evident will to make tears shed."
tt0276751,277,"Based on the best selling book by Nick Hornby, comes the lovable British comedy drama movie, 'about a boy'. Hugh Grant is once again brilliant in a film that shows how complex and easy it can be to commit to someone. This is another one of those funny British films of our time that both men and women should appreciate.

Will is a 38-year-old rich, child-free, hip and irresponsible Londoner. Will spends most of his time hanging out at restaurants and dating women with no intention of committing to a permanent relationship. After a fling with a single mother, he discovers that a good place to meet women is at single-parent help groups. Inventing a toddler son called Ned, he joins a local group and is well on the way to seducing Susie, when he meets 12-year-old Marcus, the son of Susie's friend Fiona. After this, Will's life changes in many different ways.

It has been along time since I have seen a movie quite like about a boy'. I really enjoyed the storyline, although I warn that it is complicated for one of a better word. I found the way the story was told, by both the acting and the voiceovers of the two main characters to be excellent. This aspect to the film was not only funny, but also original, as not many films dictate what should be happening, while the opposite is actually happening. Most of the credit for the way this and the whole movie was put forward must got to both the directors, the Weitz brothers, Paul and Chris. Considering that the two had a part in the outrageous American Pie' movie(s), I felt they both did an extremely good job with about a boy'.

Then what about the cast of this film! Hugh Grant has had a funny career, with of course his big hits being Notting Hill' and Bridget Jones Diary'. Yet in this, he is given a very diverse and complex character to play. Not only is he a very boring person, he is a nobody. He wants no part in a committed relationship, believing that it is not for me'. He rather enjoys toying with many women's emotions. Grant was born for this role of Will, a single bloke who wants no commitment, to spoil what he thinks is a perfect life.

Yet his character learns plenty from a young and down and out', 12 year old Marcus. In fact they both teach each other important values for life. Marcus tries to help Will grow up and be a real man, and commit to a woman, while Will attempts to show Marcus what it means to be cool'. Acting newcomer Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus. I found him to be of great value to this film, as he brings out the good in Will. In addition he does a wonderful job in his first movie role. The way both Nicholas and Grant perform onscreen together was another highlight for me.

I must not forget the other great members to this cast. Aussie Toni Collette is great as the depressed mother of Marcus. The way she portrays Fiona, is so frighteningly good. Trust me I know what it is like to feel as Fiona did in this film! In fact her role brings back memories of her character in the Sixth Sense'. I also found the small performance by Rachel Weisz suited this film well. Her character is of great importance to the balance of the story being presented.

I would also like to point out that about a boy' poses some important values for its audience. Yes, most men can be like islands' and they can be scared to commit and love women as they are. It is important to not let someone slip away or for something to stuff you up, when that is the last thing you really want. Both of the main characters show this to be so true.

So please watch about a boy', learn from it, be touched by it and laugh at it. All of these components are crucial to the film, making it one of my favourite films of this year. Also if you are single and have someone special in your life, take a chance with him or her, as you might regret not doing this for the rest of your life.

CMRS gives about a boy': 4 (very good film)"
tt0276751,278,
tt0276751,279,"Of all of my favorite moments in the film, I still treasure Grant's character declaring ""I am too an island--I'm bloody Ibitha!""...it's the moment where his carefully rationalizations for his selfish and pointless life begin to really crumble. The confused expressions on those who hear him are flawless, as is Grant's portrayal of his character's realization that all the nonsense he's been feeding us--all his rationalizations--in the narration, really make no sense at all said out loud to others.

But the movie doesn't linger on this or any other of the many delicious moments like it in the movie--no lingering, no beating you over the head with how good it was, no reminders that you're only watching a movie."
tt0276751,280,"This film epitomises the 'feel good' movie. It has a well-timed script, great soundtrack and intelligent character development assisted by outstanding performances. Grant at his best and newcomer Hoult a real talent. This movie has really left me on a happy high."
tt0276751,281,"i had never seen a Hugh Grant movie before this one. i had heard awful things about him and his films, though. i saw About a Boy on an airplane yesterday, and was happily shocked. the movie is hilarious and very relevant to modern times.

it's always nice when you have preconceived notions about an actor/film, watch it with a ""this has to really work hard to impress me"" negative attitude, and then the film wins you over ;-)"
tt0276751,282,"I have just seen this wonderful British movie and totally loved it. I loved the story and the screenplay! A lot of funny scenes but there was also some drama mixed in it. However, they managed to create a very good mixture. The acting was very good, especially by Hugh Grant, who really is a whole lot more talented than I wanted to give him credit for .. that is, until I saw Notting Hill in which he did a very nice job. In Bridget Jones Diary as well but I haven't enjoyed his performance as much before as I did in this one. The boy also did a good job as did Toni Colette. Very worth my money! And you really can't say that about many films nowadays..."
tt0276751,283,"Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is not the white sugar-boy that we expect to see in family-movies but by his temperament he changes the life of Will (a convincing Hugh Grant). It is after all a family-movie with all its ingredients: neurotic mothers, indifferent or clumsy fathers, noisy children but in this one there are no disturbing dogs or cats. The writer of the novel Nick Hornby knows what is going on nowadays in the cities: loneliness, no sense of life, boredom, children who disappoint... So this movie is a sociological study of modern life in the cities. The peculiarity of this movie is that women seem to be attracted by fathers who have children, for men it is the opposite: they avoid divorced women with children. Music is important to break up the loneliness as well for Marcus as for Will. A special mention for Hugh Grant who is acting so good as an artificial father that you think: this is really Will."
tt0276751,284,"This is the one of the most funniest movies I ever seen ín my entire life, I've been laughing almost all the time, because I have seen some things that happened me either. I never expected this movie was this good, the personages were really at its best. Also perfect combination of Comedy/Drama, at some time it makes you feel bad(suicide of Marcus' Mother), the other time it makes you feel really happy(dead duck). Really, If you didnt see this one in cinema yet, and you like comedy's and/or movies with Grant, you really have to buy the VHS/DVD, because its really worth it."
tt0276751,285,"Adapted from Nick Hornsby's cleverly written and fun novel, I found this movie immensely enjoyable. Hugh Grant stars as Will, who differs from most of us in such a fundamental way that it makes him a very interesting guy. What makes Will out-of-sync with the world is that his late father once wrote a famous and with the royalties he collects from it, he doesn't have to work to sustain himself financially. The downside of this, of course, is that he doesn't have anything substantial or fulfilling in his life but he's very comfortable with that, at least at the beginning of the story.

What changes Will's life is the inadvertent introduction of a 12-year old boy and his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) into his life when a scheme to meet an attractive mom backfires. Like some of the best relationships in life, Will's with the 12-year old Marcus is involuntary at first but the two learn a lot from each other. With a of fear of losing his mother and an uneasiness about whom he can depend on, Will gives Marcus someone to look up to, while Marcus enables Will to find meaning in his life, especially when Will meets a woman he feels he might be able to fall in love with (Rachel Weicz).

This is the second Hugh Grant film that I've seen this year, which surprises me considering I still don't think Hugh Grant works most of the time. I credit this to an excellent adaptation of Hornsby's novel that adds more depth to Grant's role than the usual bumbling romantic lead, and also because within the setting of London Grant works better within the cultural context. The boy who plays Marcus is a cute kid who's easy to dislike at the beginning, but proves pretty bright when he takes Will's immensely useful tip that it is possible to change his level of coolness simply by changing some of the little things in his appearance (getting a haircut, buying new shoes, etc). Watching that scene warmly brings back memories of that monumental day in our own lives when it dawned upon is after years of feeling hopeless within our grade school social circles that it is, in fact, possible to change your level of coolness. The film is filled with a lot of those little things in life we can relate to so much more than we thought we would."
tt0276751,286,"This entire movie was great! Grant was fantastic. The boy was great. Story, acting, plot, everything I enjoyed very much..I was completely suprised..I laughed out loud several times. Every man has his own island. So true. I love it. Go see this movie. Worth every penny!"
tt0276751,287,"I enjoyed this film; Hugh Grant fans (as I am) will appreciate this

turn as an everyman character (somewhere between the good guy

of ""Knotting Hill"" and the bad guy of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"").

Toni Collette is one of the best actresses working today, and here

turns chameleon again as an odd-ball character.

I never really warmed up to the little kid (Nicholas Hoult), but I

guess that's part of the point."
tt0276751,288,"ABOUT A BOY **__ Drama/Comedy Hugh Grant, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz

A well-to-do but immature man seems to have no purpose in life until a 12-year-old boy attaches himself to the man. The pair develops an unusual father-son relationship to the betterment of both. The story is slow, but heart-warming. No car chases. No explosions."
tt0276751,289,"`About a Boy' is simply the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It has a broad appeal, and will draw you in from the opening moment if you give it even the slightest of chances. I loved the book and was wary, like so many others, of how the adaptation would work. Well, they did a brilliant job, beginning with the casting of Hugh Grant.

I'm not really a fan of Grant: sure he was entertaining in Four Weddings, but his stock, foppish English-upper-class act got stale very quickly. Clearly he allowed himself to be stereotyped too early in his career. Well it seems as though he's turned a corner with the role of Will in `About a Boy.' Gone (or at least muted) are the mannerisms that I used to find annoying. Here he uses his hands, eyes and facial expressions in more subtle ways, and to great effect. He also plays a much more realistic, flawed character  and believably so. From now on I think the name Hugh Grant will draw me to movies rather than put me off them.

What can I say about Nicholas Hoult as Marcus except to echo what so many others have said  what an astoundingly convincing performance! He conveys very well the innocent honesty of a boy forced to grow up too fast in a world with which he isn't really in synch. He was aggravating when the plot called for it, tight-lipped at the right times, awkward in the best traditions of early adolescence, winning and off-putting like any youngster (or adult for that matter). He impressed me most in his interactions with his screen mother, in the scene where he explains to Will in a heartbreakingly matter-of-fact tone how he copes with his misfit existence, and in his encounter with Rachel's son Ali. In fact I don't think he puts a foot wrong in the whole movie. In my opinion Nicholas Hoult absolutely nailed the character.

Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz do wonders with roles that are, admittedly, under-written. Let's face it, `About a Boy' is the Will (& Marcus) Show. That's just how Hornby wrote it. But both actresses give their characters as much depth as the movie's constraints allow. Collette's Fiona is perhaps an unlikely portrait of the average single mother suffering from mental illness, but she convinces us because she is so sincere  in a movie with so many laughs, you can't help feeling moved by her tears or her expressions of affection for her son. And Weisz, despite having an even smaller part, is no less convincing in her interactions with Hugh Grant's character.

Add to the mix Augustus Prew's brief but extraordinary performance as Ali and the sweet and sour character of Ellie so ably performed by Nat Gastiain Tena, then you have perhaps the best ensemble cast in any movie made so far this year, and perhaps the best we're likely to see in all of 2002!"
tt0276751,290,
tt0276751,291,"I enjoyed Nick Hornby's novel very much and was worried when I heard it was being made into a film (especially when i heard who was to direct it - the makers of ""American Pie"" and one of the lamest comedies of the year ""Down To Earth"".) But, surprise, surprise! The film is a delight. Well-made, a terrific cast and the part of a lifetime for Hugh Grant. (To really see this man's range, rent the excellent ""Impromptu"" where he plays classical composer, Chopin) He makes the self-centered, immature character of Will so fleshed out, three-dimensional and interesting that you truly care about the guy - even though he does some awful things. Great musical score, yes, there are predictable elements to the story, but hey, this isn't a spy thriller, just an endearing film about people trying to learn to care about each other."
tt0276751,292,"""About A Boy"" is from the Nick ""high-fidelity' Hornby novel of the same name. Unlike High Fidelity, they didn't Americanize it. It was set in Britain, and had a very good cast. If you read the blurb about the film, you might have said ""chick flick"", but it's a Hornby novel, and so it isn't Hugh Grant is the main character, but he's actually very good in it, and wasn't irritating :-O Toni Collette was the vegetarian depressive hippy mother of the 'boy', and gave her usual excellent performance. Nicholas Hoult ruled the movie, and I hope he goes on to have a successful career. Rachel Weiss (British actress, and potential new love of my life grrrrr woof!) and a bunch of other well-known British tv actors made appearances. The main character spent a lot of time watching daytime TV, specifically, Countdown with Richard Whitely. Being British, I spent that time, as the ONLY PERSON IN THE PACKED DENVER CINEMA laughing, every time I hear Whitely's dulcet tones. I don't know WHAT they all thought of me. I've never felt homesick for Britain in the three years I've lived in the US, but this film tugged at my heartstrings. Perhaps it was all those shots of Hugh going round Sainsbury's? ;-) Excellent soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy. Thinking of buying it. Favourite quote: Hugh refers to the mother as ""Miss Granola Suicide""."
tt0276751,293,"Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz (American Pie) do it again with ""About a Boy"". It seems as though they took some directing tips from Wes ANDERSON, as well. And talk about a perfect screenplay, a great cast and crew, and a great message. The cast includes Hugh Grant (Will), Toni Collette (Fiona), Rachel Weisz (Rachel), Sharon Small (Christine), and Nicholas Hoult (Marcus).

See, Will (Hugh Grant) is a man who believes he is an island. Watching T.V., breaking women's hearts, and doing nothing (hey that sounds like me). But he isn't an island for long. Nope. As a matter of fact, the second he isn't an island anymore is when he meets a boy called Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). How he meets him, you'll have to find that out by seeing the movie.

I really loved watching this movie. I would want to see this about 2 or 3 more times in the theater again.

This is the comedy that brings it all. It gives a nice balance to being serious and comedic. I recommend this movie to every person alive. You will love it, no matter what. Even if you're not an island."
tt0276751,294,"This movie is not deep, has too many cliched characters, has a resolution you can see coming from across the street, but still . ..

It is funny, well acted, and has a terrific, shiny look that you don't usually get from a British film. A throwback to character based movies of the mid 20th century salted with witty writing. Will you remember this film in a year? Probably not, but it leaves a smile on your face during and after the screening.

As it happens, I know someone whose life could have served for the Hugh Grant character and his portrayal is on point. Only funnier."
tt0276751,295,"Based on the popular novel by Nick Hornby, About a Boy tells the story of Will Lightner (Grant). Will is a self-absorbed confirmed bachelor living comfortably in his very chic, very roomy London flat. As Will is occasionally forced to admit, he really does nothing for a living; his lifestyle is funded by the royalties he receives as a result of a very popular novelty Christmas song penned years ago by his father.

Will lives his life as an island, careful to avoid the personal entanglements that would require him to shift his focus from himself. He shops, he watches TV, he plays billiards, and he dates lots of women. In his frequent, short-lived relationships, Will is able to take on whatever role he needs to become Mr. Right for a time. Unfortunately, he can maintain each charade for only so long before he has to call it off, and then he is thrust into the most uncomfortable and very unwelcome role of bad guy.

Will soon discovers what he believes to be an untapped source of commitment-free relationships: single moms. Will invents a son for himself, and finagles himself a date through a support group for single parents. On his `date' he meets Marcus (Hoult), the painfully nerdy son of aging hippie, Fiona (Colette).

Marcus initially latches onto Will as a potential husband for his mom; Fiona is emotionally erratic, and Marcus desperately wants to see her happy. The `magic', as they say, is just not there for Will and Fiona. However, Marcus continues to visit Will's flat on his own, as an escape from the constant taunting at school and the emotional roller coaster at home.

Will is initially resistant to this infringement on his insular existence, but he eventually begins to accept the visits and actually starts to interact with Marcus. As Marcus becomes more of a fixture in Will's life, it slowly dawns on Will that he actually does care about somebody else's happiness: Marcus'.

Hugh Grant really makes this movie. He is delightfully shallow and cynical as Will, managing to step beyond his traditional role of the bumbling, hapless, hopeless romantic. Some of his comments and asides should have you laughing out loud. Nicholas Hoult does a good job as Marcus, (although he could work on his enunciation), and Toni Colette is appropriately annoying as the over-protective mother."
tt0276751,296,"""About A Boy"" is a wonderful movie. Hugh Grant does a great job playing the blank, shallow Will who finally learns to connect with people when he meets 12 year-old Marcus. I was hesitant to see ""About A Boy"" when I heard the directors of this film were the minds behind American Pie and American Pie 2 --although I can't bash those movies, I've never seen them.

""About A Boy"" had several opportunities to become a cliche romantic comedy but never did -- it never took the easy way out. The characters were fully developed and didn't do things way out of character, Bravo! And that's the beauty of ""About A Boy"", the characters seem like they could be real people. They aren't caricatures of people.

""About A Boy"" is a truly funny, entertaining, and touching movie that shouldn't be missed. There are frustrating and embarrassing (can't look at the screen) parts of this movie (which makes it not perfect). If you liked High Fidelity (from the same author) or maybe even Notting Hill (but don't expect as much romance), I bet you'll like ""About A Boy"". About A Boy is not an amalgam of those movies but it shares its sensibilities with them.

It's a 9 out of 10 (A -)"
tt0276751,297,"This was a good movie, very good dialogue, great characters and Hugh Grant is perfect. It's refreshing that people are still making movies based on good dialogue and character studies rather than special effects, violence and sex. I think it was rather refreshing to see that this movie centers mainly on the developing relationship between this emotionally stunted man and this sensitive, caring young boy. I'd like to see these movies do better at the box office because its just such a shame in this country that these big block busters with all these special effects and no stories or interesting characters do so well and yet the really good movies are falling by the wayside."
tt0276751,298,"It very rarely happens that a movie, based on a successful novel, can live up to the expectations. And yet again this theory is proved. Because 'About a Boy' is just an ok, well made film that almost never excites as much as the book by Nick Hornby. Some moments are funny, others sad and in the end the makers did their job. But that isn't supposed to their main goal. They have to at least show us why they thought it was necessary to turn it into a film. And they never did in my opinion. So if you want to have an ok time, see the film. If you really want to enjoy yourself, read the book. Same goes for the other Hornby-novels-turned-into-films 'Fever Pitch' and 'High Fidelity'. 5/10"
tt0276751,299,"I loved every minute of this warmhearted, feel-good film. The kid who plays ""the kid"" is just wonderful. Hugh Grant is brilliant. Toni Colette is also great. It's just a nice change from your typical romantic comedies, this one coming strictly from a male's perspective. 10/10"
tt0276751,300,"I went into this movie thinking it was just another date-movie, chick flick. I changed my mind after only a few minutes. Hugh Grant displays an acting ability that I haven't seen in any of his other movies. The boy who plays Marcus is about as believable as could be; having been on the wrong end of popularity before, I could definitely relate to his character. Now Marcus's mother was a bit unbelievable. But I like the flow, the personal narration by the two main characters, and overall I would give the movie a 9.5-10.

P.S. My wife really liked it too. That makes this a keeper when it comes on video..."
tt0276751,301,"Great script. Great directing. Great editing. Great acting. Great sets. Great costumes. Great music by Badly Drawn Boy. No special effects. No action sequences. No one gets shot. No one has sex on-screen. No one swears. Funny, interesting, though-provoking, real. How can you top this? If a viewer is thirteen, or forty, this movie will get the heart and mind going. What more can be said?

Hugh Grant has joined the Hollywood madness and lost too much weight. Toni Colette is superb as the depressed, crazy, hippie mom. Whoever costumed her was right on target and deserves high praise! Nicholas Hoult, who plays the kid with the bad haircut, is also great. He is the best, most true-to-life film geek ever!

If Nick Hornsby keeps writing books that make such great films, we can look forward to many such simple films. Let Hollywood know you like simple films!! GO SEE THIS ONE! I hope these producers and directors make many more like this! Great job, everyone!"
tt0276751,302,"Hugh Grant plays Will, a man in his late thirties who has never needed to work since he has been able to live off the royalties from a song his father wrote in the 1960s. His relationships with women never last more than two months with no job or proper relationship, Will has never had any need for responsibility. This changes when he joins a single parent group (Will does not have a child but he uses the group's meetings as a scheme for meeting single women). At a single parent group picnic, he is brought into contact with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) a twelve year old who lives alone with his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) and is bullied regularly at school. The film tells the story of how friendship develops between man and boy.

In this film, we have a hip and cool Hugh Grant: he has a new short haircut and trendier clothes. Yet again, he comes across on screen as extremely likeable and it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part of Will. One problem I had was difficulty in warming to Nicholas Hoult's performance. He is a pretty average actor and I suspect that we are unlikely to see him on screen again. Since the story is all about the relationship between Will and Marcus, Grant has a lot to carry and he simply is not provided sufficient support to make the film as a sure-fire comedy classic as it would initially appear on paper.

The film uses narrative voice-over by the two principle actors which serves to replace Nick Hornby's written word. This seems unnecessary at times and I often found the voice-overs an irritation, particularly in the case of Hoult who fails to convince with his emotions.

I had high expectations for the cinematic adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel and I think my familiarity with the book is probably the reason why I left the cinema feeling slightly disappointed."
tt0276751,303,"From the makers of 'Bridget Jones' Diary' comes this film that has the best performance ever by Hugh Grant. He is funny, obnoxious and touching all within the span of 100 minutes. His character is generation X and is just about as real as it gets. He's a 38 year old rich guy living off the royalties of a one hit wonder song his father wrote years ago. He dates and dumps women without a care for their feelings, he lounges at home watching videos and getting drunk and stoned while doing it, plays pool, and has his hair cut by sexy hair dressers. Then he befriends a boy about 12 who is more manly than he is and teaches him to be a responsible adult. The film intertwines broken families with the reality of single parenthood and the pros of cons of bachelorhood and the eventual decision that may not always be one of choice but rather one of destiny. A wonderful film that finds humour in places you wouldn't expect it to be. Not something new but certainly something a lot of people can relate to. You have to like that."
tt0276751,304,"""About a Boy"" from directors Chris and Paul Weitz is the best movie of the year so far. It is a bold romantic comedy that has something to say, and whose transformation of it's lead character, Will, played by Hugh Grant in perhaps his best work, is so satisfying and touching. The screenplay by Peter Hedges, Chris and Paul Weits, based on the novel by Nick Hornby is smart, funny, and politically incorrect--which I love. Hedges and the Weitzes take on such topics as single parenting, suicide, and school peer pressure with an edge and always a sense of humor.

Hugh Grant plays Will, 38 years old, single, and does ""nothing"" for a living. He watches TV, drives around in his Audi TT, and has vapid relationships with beautiful women. He lives off the royalties of a song that father wrote years ago. He tells two of his friends who want him to be their daughter's godfather, ""Yes, I really am this shallow."" Contrary to John Dunne or is Jon Bon Jovi... Will ""is an island"". He maybe shallow, and he is having a grand time. Will even stumbles upon a new dating community: single mothers. That's how Will meets 12 year old Marcus (played by an excellent Nicholas Hoult). Will goes on a picnic with a single mom who is looking after Marcus. Marcus wears dreary clothes, and sports a bad haircut. Marcus is everything that Will is not, uncool and possessing depth of character.

Marcus's mom Fiona (played by Toni Collette) attempts suicide and ends up in the hospital for a spell. Then it occurs to Marcus that having two people are not enough (i.e. he and his Mom). What happens when one is gone? You need back up. Marcus is smart. The back up is Will. Marcus invites himself over to Will's everyday. The beautiful thing of it all is that Will really doesn't change all that much. He teaches Marcus about being cool, and Marcus teaches Marcus about having integrity, and ultimately doing what is important. This is put to the test when Will meets an awesome single mom, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz), with whom he would like to spend his life, and asks Marcus to pretend that he is his son.

""About a Boy"" is about ""No man is an island."" Life is funny, sad, and inspiring all at the same time. What's valuable is a sense of integrity and community. The end of the movie is sentimental and truly heart felt. Hugh Grant gives a stellar performance. He is so believable as the guy who really doesn't care about people, and finally gets that people are the only important thing. This is something that I relate to totally. Grant plays it smart and uncompromising which makes poignant Will's fall and triumph. This is Grant best work. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is just perfect. He is so natural, and captures a young boy's suffering and joy. Hoult makes believable Marcus's wisdom which he teaches by example to Grant's Will. Toni Collette is great as Marcus's mother, who finally gets a clue. Rachel Weisz's Rachel is perfect as the woman Will falls in love with.

Also kudos for the movie dealing with suicide and it's cost with an uncompromising edge, a sense of humor, and compassion. ""About a Boy"" is truly awesome work by all involved."
tt0276751,305,"The film's subtle but masterful humor cleverly weaves together a look at postmodern London through the eyes of Will Lightman. Hugh Grant pulls off his best performance yet as the shallow, hedonistic anti-hero of this postmodern masterpiece. The real star of ""About A Boy, "" is the almost flawless script which isn't afraid to use language to create truly interesting characters. I loved this film and think you will too."
tt0276751,306,"Critics who have seen many more films than I agree that this is among the smartest, most delightful comedies of this or any recent year. Especially refreshingly, this distinction comes the old-fashioned way: with a solid and intelligent script, fine acting, and direction with a sense of-- well, direction. We see an honest, intimate comedy of manners, with no overlay of untoward pretentions like flashy special effects or a budget to vie with third-world countries.

Furthermore, its release date is a fittingly cheeky gesture itself, juxtaposing this tidy little work of art with its opposite, a sprawling, spectacular episode of Star Wars. The world is, alas, not always a reasonable place, but there is no *reason* why it should thereby suffer from its competition at the hands of anyone who attends more than one movie per season. There are various sorts of good movie. If perchance two are showing simultaneously, is it too much to expect that we see one and return for the other next weekend, blessing our good fortune and storing up such unaccustomed pleasure in one's hump? Treks between the desert's oases seem to lengthen over time.

But now to differ a little with the critics: I even sympathized with the character of Will. A ""blank""? Yes, seemingly he is. But ""a bastard"", whom audiences ""love to hate""? Where have folks been since 9/11? ""First do no harm"" is a similarly blank, or negative precept, yet as a basic ethical hurdle it fells many even whom we don't usually love to hate. I suggest beginning with it.

Will stands in the tradition of generations of ladies and gentlemen of leisure who live quietly in their homes and let others do likewise. Further, awhile back we all might have enjoyed the reminiscent comedies of, say, Noel Coward, who portrayed such with a smile, complete with equally creative strategems to beguile the opposite sex. As for us, typically we save up because by age 65-- or 60 if we can possibly manage-- our life's ambition is to attain to Will's situation; whereas he is, shall we say, retired at 38. There gapes the gulf between us.

Yeah, Will likes his sports car (although not too much to consign it to a daft woman when rushing out to save a daft boy), but apparently he doesn't habitually burn up irreplaceable resources gallivanting around the world in jets or yachts. Such self-indulgence, hardly confined to the leisure class anymore, irreversibly deprives all posterity of not only energy but plastic. Otherwise, money that passes through his albeit frivolous hands cyclically provides employment and livelihood to others, making his lifestyle no more malign than that of most Londoners.

Meanwhile, Will schemes no scams to weasel into the wallets of unsuspecting fellow citizens. He is not selling drugs. He doesn't blow up buildings or teach kids to kill Jews under the pretext of some exotic religion. We might wish that he weren't quite so stand-offish for so long towards the lonely and needy like Marcus (who, I agree, with most but not all, is nicer than Will). But, then, to such lengths one must go nowadays to ensure that gestures towards the young aren't misunderstood. Good-old Will even passes that test-- under the eagle eye of a mother who, over this issue, suddenly jolts herself out of her free-thinking, nostalgic, bipolar haze into a shocked vigilance, in the finest tradition of properly instructed, up-to-date 'parenting.'

In the sense that these scenes don't fit her character, they don't work. But I bet the directors knew and intended this incongruity full well. Given the Stygian streams that cultural spelunkers James Kincaid and Judith Levine have mapped at last, and the ritual coin in the mouth for the boatman before contemporary audiences can sit back and enjoy an intergenerational relationship, theirs was so abrupt and blatent as to constitute satire. As Marcus would trill, this stroke was ""brilliant!"" Quentin Crisp would agree, who advised: if and when you must start going bald, the cool thing to do is shave your head.

So, by today's real standards (i.e., divested of vestigial Marxist lip service), we have, er, what to hate in Will Freeman? Two generations ago we admired undisguised leisure and a modicum of independent wealth. Now, our blue noses ever to whomever's grindstone, we affect to despise them. If this change came from living in a society become generally freer, more just, more promising, and more gracious than then, I'd agree: fair enough, goodbye and good riddance to Will and all his ilk. But that is not what I see outside theaters. Do you?

Does the inferred distaste arise from the fact that-- unlike countless others who live too high on the hog to maintain straight-faced that they earn their keep, however chronically ""stressed-out"" they may become on behalf of their chosen standard-- Will is a *single man*? Does a T-shirt glimpsed in the film's first minutes say it all? ""Lorene Bobbitt for Surgeon General"" reads the chest of a woman obviously eager to proclaim her independence from men, but perhaps less eager to return men the favor.

From Hollywood's ghoulies and ghosties, long-leggedy beasties, things that go bump in the night, and earnest turning-over-new-leaves by dramatically converted protagonists, good Lord deliver us, as the Weitzes have already done. Not for them the conjuration of lightning flashes. Freemasonry, it is said, quietly takes good men and makes them better. Once he'd doggedly pounded his way in, 12-year-old Marcus quietly took a blank man and made him good. I'm happy. Maybe even, someday, Will Freeman Will Freemason, but that's another movie (always leave room for a sequel, in which he could even defy American-imperialist bugaboos enough to give Marcus a hug the next time the kid fears for his mother's life). Meanwhile, both man and boy-- or is it both boys-- could do worse. Like most movies."
tt0276751,307,"Despite the obvious sarcasm above, I felt this was one of Hugh Grant's best acting efforts; and all in all, a film with surprising depth, charm and meaning. One might be tempted to call it a ""romantic comedy,"" but I think it would be more appropriate to call it a slice-of-life-type film that happens to contain good-sized dollops of romance and humor. Hugh Grant, as a true ne'er-do-well, lives off of royalties generated by an inane but successful Christmas song written by his father. He lives an admittedly meaningless life. He's never worked seriously at anything, including relationships. Then he discovers single moms ... and despite himself, begins to grow up. Saying much more about the plot does little to explain why I think this movie is a must-see; rather, let's observe that Grant shows true subtlety (rather than vacuousness as he sometimes does.) He also shows us a character we really don't like at first --- and still realize is flawed, even at the end. But he finally learns he is 'not an island,' and the trip getting there is worth hitching up to. All others, including the ""boy"" that the title refers to (I forget his name) offer solid supporting roles, and the direction is crisp and interesting; this could have been a movie with long yawn stretches, but it kept my interest throughout. Moreover, it is a movie that discusses a very pertinent post-modernist question: are we really islands? I think you'll discover yourself pondering the movie's message for days afteward."
tt0276751,308,"This absolutely delightful movie kept me smiling for days after I'd seen it. Today I saw it again, for the third time. I've seen it with every member of my family. It has something for everyone...exploring what makes the most cynical of men tick...and at the same time touching on how parents sometimes unwittingly put their own needs and preferences ahead of their children's. The film is superbly well acted all around - fine cast. Toni Collette does a lovely job as Will's mother - providing humorous moments, as well as some very real ones. The biggest standouts here obviously though are Hugh Grant as ""Will"" in an absolutely winning performance - one that I'm sure many will feel displays an unusual degree of depth for him...and Nicholas Hoult as ""Marcus."" This child was amazing! You will truly share in the ups and downs of this child's life...and cheer him on as he works to better his situation, and his mother's. As for Hugh Grant - he succeeds in making a character with no apparent redeeming qualities absolutely likeable. The soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is also a real winner! Most interesting thing to me about this film is that all 3 times I've seen it the audience has been made up of an incredibly varied mix...men & women, young & old, various races/ethnicities...and yet all enjoying it...all ""getting the jokes""...don't see that too often. Don't miss this one - it's a true and rare gem!"
tt0276751,309,"I'd really like to give this an 8, but I can't get over how disjointed the directing, camerawork and/or editing were in so many scenes; I think I've got to give it a really high 7. The writing is TERRIFIC (although we really aren't surprised by anything in the plot), and the actors are first-rate - virtually without exception. This is perhaps Hugh Grant's best performance, and the other actors - particularly the numerous younger actors - really couldn't be better. But I couldn't help feeling that they couldn't quite decide how to shoot a lot of the scenes, because in a few pivotal scenes (Toni Collette's confrontation with Grant late in the film, for example), they kept cutting back and forth between about 4 or 5 camera angles. I know it seems like nitpicking but it really annoyed me while watching, almost to the point of having a disorienting effect. In another scene, the camera kept gliding back and forth between two actors across a table from one another, and I felt I was going to start getting seasick if it went on very long. Maybe they shot scenes from a lot of angles, and then tried to keep the best moments from all the different shots and it ended up getting really choppy; I really don't know. But I do know that I found most of the camerawork really uninspired, certainly much less so than in Notting Hill.

The film was cut by the same editor (Nick Moore) who did Notting Hill and The Full Monty (both of which had a much smoother rhythm than this one), though I suspect he probably did the best with what he had.. The cinematographer (Remi Adefarasin) previously worked on a number of top projects, including Elizabeth (which also struck me as having too much overly busy camera movement), and Band of Brothers (on which he probably shot a ton of footage from countless angles). My best guess is that a couple of young directors (the Weitzes, coming off a really dreadful movie) got a little overwhelmed by a cinematographer who had all kinds of ideas about camera tricks and angles. They would have been better served if they had calmed it down a little. Again, a top-notch 7 of 10 - ALMOST an 8."
tt0276751,310,"I loved this movie. I saw it on Saturday the week-end it came out with my wife and she loved it also. The movie is great. I would rank it with Fever Pitch as the best Nick Hornby film adaptation (High Fidelity was also great and I enjoy it more every time I see it). Hugh Grant gives a great performance and doesn't do many of his tricks such as stuttering and fluttering his eyes that he sometimes has done in the past. The child is amazing and practically perfect. Toni Collete is also terrific. The movie is really funny and at parts very dark and sad, but you leave the theater somehow happy and uplifted. I really like the shallowness of Grant's character and the selfishness of Collette's character. The movie portrayed them how they were and was not judging them to be bad people just a bit mixed up (like real people). The voice-over of the boy's and Grant's characters were hilarious and pitch perfect for their emotional stages. The best scene is when the boy tries to play matchmaker with his mother and Will Freeman and you hear his take on what a great time they are having and Will's less optimistic view. If you liked or loved this film check out Fever Pitch and High Fidelity, you will enjoy them too. I would rank this movie, at least a 9 out of 10, maybe even a 10."
tt0276751,311,"Think of a naughty word. Double it. Treble it. Repeat with feeling.

No, not (only) most of the opening words of ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"", but (also) the probable reaction on hearing that Hugh Grant was to play the part of Will, at least by those who've read the book. I haven't read any of Nick Hornby's work but even I can see that this was a terrible miscasting. Will is the very opposite of sympatico. No need to work (large inheritance), no social conscience, no emotional maturity, he's the kind of oafish boy-in-a-man's-body that we all love to despise. So whose bright idea was it to let Hugh Grant turn him into an apologetic moderately-charming young-man-in-need-of-some-competent-mothering? There must be dozens of actors better suited to the part. Neil Pearson sprang to my mind immediately, if only because Grant's voice-overs sounded quite like Pearson, which meant I could try to enjoy most of the film by mentally pasting Pearson over the top of Grant. I nearly succeeded, too, but for the major problem that this film shares with too many others, namely the schizophrenia of good actors in shallow parts.

Nicholas Hoult turns in a highly watchable performance as Marcus (the other, younger ""Boy"") and Toni Collette reminds us that she can be almost as chamaeleonic a performer as Nicole Kidman. (I know I'm not alone in suspecting that if Collette had allowed herself to be dragged into the Hollywood mainstream we would be benefitting from seeing her in much more interesting roles. Ok, she's not a looker, but then neither is Meryl Streep.) But I digress; their parts and those of others here are poorly fleshed. Perhaps this is a problem inherent in turning a piece of literature into visual entertainment: a book can afford to spend a whole page describing someone's thoughts about a single short incident, whereas a film has to paint an overall impression in a few frames. Still, that's surely a poor excuse for central cardboard cut-out characters like the depressed leftie right-on organic single mother and the group of ""all men are bastards except for you 'cos you're a single father"" women, all carefully cast to be unattractive so of course they couldn't hang on to their men, they didn't deserve to did they? Please, give me a break.

A film of two parts, then. 3/10 for Grant and the cardboard folk, 7/10 for Hoult's and Collette's acting. Call it 5/10."
tt0276751,312,"The trailer actually does this movie justice, few of them ever do. Grant's performance shows steady progress and his character develops perfectly. The film is not entirely predictable which is nice, and the British humor plays out just right. The story itself is drawn out wonderfully as are the monologues. A great story, acting, and movie overall. Ranks up there with Notting Hill."
tt0276751,313,"Hugh Grant does a wonderful job playing Will, a guy whose heading nowhere in life. Then he meets a boy, Marcus, that changes it all. Will attempts to help Marcus fit in with the kids at his school. As this fails, so does Wills attempt to win Rachel, his new found love. I won't ruin the end for you, but trust me, it's good!

The comedy in this film is great! And so is the music! I recommend this hilarious movie to anyone."
tt0276751,314,"""About a Boy"" is the story of a superficial hipster who discovers his humanity, who comes to learn of his need and capability to love, through a paternal relationship to a troubled young boy.

Even so, it's still worth watching.

Will Freeman (get it?) is a London man-about-town who has raised superficiality to a form of high art. He has no job, no interests, no close friends. He lives off the royalties from a song his late father wrote years before (it's not a very good song, either, and watching Will's reaction as it stalks him everywhere he goes is a lot of fun). Will's time is filled with nothing: he watches TV, he has his hair done, he plays pool, he chases women, but he has no substantive existence. And that's just how he likes it.

He hits upon a scheme to focus his skirt-chasing on young single mothers, who are eager for male attention but skittish about emotional commitment. This plan brings him into contact with 12-year-old Marcus, a bright but miserable kid who divides his time between torture at school and his unstable home life with his hippie mom (Toni Collette). Marcus decides he needs a backup support system, and schemes by persistence and blackmail to recruit Will as a surrogate father.

The scenario lends itself to being a kind of post-modern ""Parent Trap"": cute kid brings together two people who are just so gosh-darn perfect for each other that the only reason they aren't together is that they have to drag it out so the audience can finish its popcorn. But this movie refuses to follow any easily-spotted pattern, and there are too many other characters and relationships spinning in its orbit anyway. ""About a Boy"" takes any number of relationship comedy ideas, any one of which could have its own pedestrian high-concept movie built around it, and mixes them , blender-like, into its narrative. It keeps all these balls in the air by maintaining an extremely sharp and witty edge. In the saccharine world of change-your-heart movies, it's a big shot of insulin. But in being so, it manages to beat the sweeties at their own game: its moments of emotional weight are all the more effective because we're not under constant empathy fatigue.

To look at Hugh Grant, even in the movies where he plays insufferably cute, is to see a man who could brilliantly portray a rat fink, since he seems to have a lot of experience (just ask Elizabeth Hurley). And his Will is a virtuoso of callow self-involvement. He doesn't kid himself; he is content in his shallowness, as his caustic and funny narration makes clear (being that empty apparently requires a great deal of self-knowledge). It is this narration that is one of the best parts of Grant's performance: his onscreen reactions are in perfect synch with his offscreen words, which makes his internal monologue a vital part of the movie instead of a clunky device. Grant expertly walks a tightrope between pathos and obnoxiousness, since if he were too likable or too nasty, he wouldn't hold our interest the way he does.

Naturally, Will's shallowness is a mask for some deep and roiling emotions that he refuses to deal with, regarding his father and his upbringing (and that freakin' song). This is nicely understated: we are never subjected to teary emotional confessions or wrenching anecdotes on his part.

As Marcus, Nicholas Hoult creates a presence to match Grant's. The boy is both smart and troubled, but they don't become the kind of overbearing cardinal traits that usually dominate and define children in movies. His most prominent characteristic is a kind of morose calculation: he doesn't gravitate toward Will out of sentiment or affection, but just decides that he needs some ""backup"" and figures that, realistically, Will is what he has to work with. And work he does: the movie lets us watch as a relationship based on mutually beneficial deceit gradually and almost defiantly becomes real and deep. Hoult's interior monologue is almost as funny as Grant's. It reveals a kid who has grown up fast, who is wry and self-aware but still, and palpably, just a kid.

As Marcus's mom, Toni Collette sheds the maternal seriousness and scientific stare that have become a sort of trademark for her in movies like ""Changing Lanes"" and ""The Sixth Sense"". Her role isn't too big, but she gives us a compelling portrayal of loving but freaked-out instability with the screen time she has. Only Rachel Weisz fails to make much impression, as a love interest of Grant's: she's not bad, but it's tough playing a late-coming and slightly underwritten character, when everyone around you is so good.

The script by Nick Hornby and Peter Hedges is clever and fast-moving, so much so that at the end of the movie, you are impressed by the sheer amount of things that happen in ""About a Boy"". Directors Chris and Paul Weitz (the ""American Pie"" guys!) keep things going at a brisk pace, with a minimum of showy camera work, though there is a rotating pan of Hoult in the schoolyard that is beautifully executed and well-placed. It deftly evokes self-involved urban cool, the terrors of junior high, the pain of missing pieces in your life, and the peculiar joys of families, ersatz and otherwise. Though the story strains its own believability at times (it's hard to figure how Grant gets into all these parties if he doesn't know anyone and just mostly watches TV), it charms its way to forgiveness, or at least acceptance. Its lessons are familiar, but nicely rendered: Everybody needs backup. Everybody has something to offer other people. And sometimes, you just have to get out there and sing Roberta Flack with your eyes closed.

I'm pretty sure they meant that last part metaphorically. No, seriously, stop that. Please."
tt0276751,315,"About a Boy is directed by Chris and Paul Weitz. This is their third film their have directed. I think much better film than their last film Down to Earth, which they directed. The Weitzes are expanding their horizons by doing a total different film not used to seeing. Hugh Grant plays a thirtysomething bachelor who befriends a troubled grade-schooler played by Nicholas Hoult. Grant and Hoult are brilliant together ironing out their differences on screen. About a Boy has some comic moments, but the film has serious overtones to it. Well worth a look."
tt0276751,316,
tt0276751,317,"ABOUT A BOY is about Will Freeman, an immature, single, childless adult (Hugh Grant; boy, bet you could have guessed that!) who 'does nothing' for a living (he's living off royalties from a xmas song his grandfather wrote) and decides that joining a single parents' club is the best way to meet girls. But Will gets more than he bargained for when he meets up with 12-yr old Marcus, a nerd's nerd, and his wacky, hippie mom, Fiona (played by Toni Collette, the mom in The Sixth Sense), even though Will has eyes for another single mom (or two or three).

In one great scene, Will is out to dinner with another woman, and he gets into a shouting match with Fiona (who does not seem to understand why Marcus is a social outcast) when she storms into the restaurant wanting to know what kind of relationship Will is having with her son. Great use of voice-overs by Will & Marcus throughout the movie.

The movie is based on a best-selling book by one of my favorite authors, Nick Hornby, who also wrote High Fidelity and Fever Pitch.

This one keeps you laughing and, if you can put up with (yet again) Hugh Grant's fluttering eyelids, is worth seeing. 8 of 10 stars"
tt0276751,318,"About a Boy is a sweet and charming film; which is to be expected from a Hugh Grant film. Although not quite as wonderful as Bridget Jones Diary, About a Boy still manages to be one of the most pleasing films so far this year. Very well written and genuinely honest, this film is carried mainly by Hugh Grant's wonderful charisma, and a likable cast that I actually cared about. In a year full of dull comedies, About a Boy isn't to be missed.

A wonderful soundtrack as well."
tt0276751,319,"I wasn't really sure what to expect walking into this movie. I knew some of the short previews I'd seen looked amusing. Beyond that I wasn't too sure what the film was actually about. After viewing it I can honestly say that so far, this is the only movie I've seen this summer that's been worth the price of admission. Good acting, good script, good music... a really enjoyable film. Hugh Grant is perfect in the lead role and is surrounded by an equally great supporting cast. The film is funny, touching, and just plain fun. I left the theatre in a really good mood. I can't remember the last time a movie's done that to me. In a summer filled with cold, hollow special effects brimmed duds- it was refreshing to see a movie that actually had some heart."
tt0276751,320,"Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) is the quintessential bachelor: good looks, health, independent means and completely unattached. Add an element of privilege, remove any trace of ambition and include a generous helping of self-reliance and you've got a character you love to hate. This man-child has just about all that's distasteful in the modern bachelor and the Peter Pan Syndrome has never been so well represented. Get the picture?

Yet there's a hint of growth here. Will has a new strategy to pursue more vulnerable women: pretend you're a single dad and join a support group since that's where the single moms hang. However, a few steps into this pond and Mr. Shallow is out of his depth. Most of these joiners don't fit the demographics Will seeks. But it's through SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) that he connects with the Boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).

A wonderful screenplay keeps this film moving through the perilous quest that would undermine a lesser talent. Letting us into the thoughts of our hero (using voice-over) adds an unspoken monologue that tops his incredibly self-centered attitude. And he gets away with it. Marcus has his thoughts treated this way as well and here we see adolescent struggles with socialization, acceptance and responsibilities. Though 25 years separate the man and the boy, their struggles are the same. We sympathize with Marcus since these lessons are age appropriate for him. Will should have gotten past it long ago. Arrested development isn't an acceptable defense.

Toni Collette sensitively plays the boy's suicidal mom. Rachel Wiesz handles the role of the ultimate challenge (taming Will).

'About a Boy' then is really about two boys, both seeking an identity that extends beyond their own needs and interests. How they do it is the substance of this film that deserves your time. Will realizes that relationships involving more than two members may have exponentially greater potential. Perhaps not in all cases, but this realization helps propel Will from boyhood.

When you see this film, you'll be all ""About a Boy."""
tt0276751,321,"The most interesting thing about this well made, well acted movie

was not the blah story about a shallow man saved by connecting

with a kid. It was the contradiction between pro-family propaganda

and the evidence onscreen. The same smart, warm hearted kid

who effortlessly saved the man had a mother who was suicidal.

She was an idealistic woman who loved her son and was on good

terms with the father. (She was presented as a loser with no

fashion sense but Toni Collete's performance rescued her and

made her far more intriguing than Grant's character.) Goodness

and parenthood didn't make her feel good. Write that one off as

mental illness? There was a group of Single Mothers who were

angry, unsatisfied and unsaved by their devotion to their kids.

Maybe only men can be saved by kids and women can only be

saved by men? Enough of these bromides! People sometimes

save each other, sometimes ""hell is other people"", as Sartre put it.

Family is not some kind of Botox for the soul.

Grant's character was truly an empty man. Can you imagine having

an education and an independent income and reaching the age of

38 without developing a passion for anybody or anything? That

kind of poverty has no quick fix. In real life some workaholics are

socially deprived and rescued by human contact, which is a

different movie cliche.

This was one of the only depictions of a kid with a kind heart and a

good mind who overcomes his troubles without fist fighting, kick

boxing or any other violence. The young actor was terrific. BRAVO!

Worth the price of admission."
tt0276751,322,"What an incredible movie. I definitely think that this movie qualifies as one of the best films of the year. A film that appeals to all ages, sexes, and personalities, About a Boy is both hilarious and touching. Hugh Grant was phenomenal and Toni Collette and Nicholas Hoult played equally great supporting roles.

After seeing this movie, I was all smiles the rest of the day. What a nice feeling to come out of a movie feeling hopeful and giddy."
tt0276751,323,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this thoroughly since....High Fidelity. The Weitz bros are surprisingly on mark in their direction of Peter Hedges' clever screenplay to the amazing book by Nick Hornby. Those who feel ambivalent (or downright despite) for Hugh Grant should not allow this to be a reason not to see this movie. In fact, that may as well help you enjoy the movie more! The acting and visuals are easy to digest. The soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy delivers in a big way."
tt0276751,324,"This movie is simply magnificent. Not much else to say. If you have not yet seen it, please do. Hugh Grant is amazing as Will, and the rest of the cast play their respective roles just as well. The book is great, the movie does it more than justice."
tt0276751,325,"Being that I am a big Nick Hornby fan and especially partial to his book About a Boy, I was a bit skeptical when I heard that it was being made into a movie. When I heard that Hugh Grant was going to play the part of Will Freeman, I became increasingly wary, frightened he would turn the character into another Notting Hill blubbering fool who can't really spit out his words. So the movie finally came out. I went and saw it. My predictions were entirely wrong. About a Boy blew me away. It was beautifully put together; each frame was perfect. Hugh Grant did a marvelous job, as did the rest of the cast. Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack is my new favorite album. Although the book and the movie are different at parts, I feel that they altered the storyline so that it would be more plausible as a movie, which in my opinion is fine -- as long as Nick Hornby had a say in what was changed, which I'm sure he did. About a Boy was so good that I wish I could relive the experience of seeing it for the first time over and over again. Go see this movie."
tt0276751,326,"Hugh Grant always seems to land the perfect role in these type of movies and this film is no exception. He seems to have the knack to play the innocent, naive and fumbling young man which the viewers adore. The audience also unknowingly develops a sympathetic view of him which all makes for an interesting set of events as we follow this character through the movie.

A care-free Will played by Hugh Grant enjoys the worldly pleasures of being an independent bachelor but this all changes when he meets a boy of a single mum. At first Will is taken back by the brazen nature of the boy but they eventually become good buddies. Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult gives a fine performance as the boy who is taunted at school and is also troubled by her mothers suicidal attempts. The film has some very funny moments and manages to address the hard truths of relationships, personal anxieties and the simple matter of just growing up. A light hearted and down to earth movie which makes a change from the many action flicks that are in abundant supply today."
tt0276751,327,"I really wanted this movie to be better than it was... but unfortunately it was only just above ""decent"" in my book.

There is some good story-telling here, a fantastic soundtrack, and the lad that plays ""Marcus"" was really brill.

Rachel Weisz was merely window dressing, her character is barely developed in this film (and frankly, I just didn't care about what was developed).

Toni Collette was great as Fiona (Marcus's depressed and suicidal mother).

Finally, Hugh Grant as ""Will"" is very believable as a jaded, self-centered, do-nothing louse (albeit a cute one). It was fun to watch him find love and laughter with a young and geeky boy who befriends him happenstance.

There are a few subtle references to Will's own childhood that I would have liked to see more of. This is obviously the core cause of his current state of being, and yet the director only gives us hints and innuendo. You get a sense there is a deep sadness in Will, but it is never fully explored. Too bad actually, because I think it would have helped the audience relate more to Will.

This film is definitely smarter than the pre-summer fluff that is currently dominating the theaters, but not genius smart. Entertaining and thoughtful, and I'd absolutely recommend purchasing the soundtrack (done by ""Badly Drawn Boy"")."
tt0276751,328,
tt0276751,329,"About A Boy, is about a man finding maturity through an accidental friendship with a twelve-year-old boy. This movie was funny, sad and entertaining. Hugh Grant was hilarious in this role as a man without much to do besides dating women and watching TV. Not necessarily a chick-flick, guys can benefit from seeing this film, too."
tt0276751,330,"Simply stated, this was a movie that made you laugh without the idiot humor that generally caters to the 10 year old. I was sorry to see the movie end and would definitely recommend it. Hugh Grant was excellent and Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) did an amazing job.

A movie about a man who is basicly headed nowhere until he comes in contact with a young boy who changes his life. Sometimes predictable but each scene was done with just the right amount of humor and compassion.

Some scenes were hilarious, such as when Grant's character joins SPAT just to meet women.

Go see it, decide for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
tt0276751,331,"Greatly enjoyed About a Boy, even more than (gasp) the book. There's nothing like Nick Hornby to give you a good time at the old cinny, but with a healthy dollop of fibre so you know that it's also good for you.

They definitely have to give out Oscars for performances like Hugh Grant's. Unfortunately, ""light comedy/drama"" doesn't cut it with the Academy. To date, Colin Firth and John Cusack have taken shots at Nick's classic ""stunted emotional man trying to connect to real life without props (Pop, Arsenal, etc.)"" but Hugh's is the best. Toni Collette also did extremely well, making a role that could have been laughable have real resonance by the end.

I think I enjoyed the film so much because, paradoxically, I didn't connect to the book the way I did to Fever Pitch and High Fidelity. I just took it as a movie, rather than as an adapted version of something very close to my heart. The only downside? It lost half a point for the ""guitar at school"" scene, which seemed to be pasted into the screenplay to give Will a chance to absorb humiliation on behalf of Marcus. But this is worthy of a high recommendation. Much more than a Hugh Grant romantic comedy chickflick."
tt0276751,332,"""About a Boy"" was a fine film with a solid blend of good acting and fun laughs/moments. As has been commented by several film critics already, it marks yet another step in Hugh Grant's evolution from ""charming fop"" roles that he so popularized in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Of course, now we may have to be concerned with his being typecast as the jerky Englishman...along with Toni Collette being typecast as the lonely single mom.

Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) gave a very good performance in his first major film role. His acting was believable and not at all ""trained."" Still, what I'm surprised at most of all is that the Weitz brothers (of ""American Pie"" and ""Here on Earth"" fame/infamy) directed this film. The film was really quite excellently directed and a real testament to the fact that they can direct adult flicks with maturity *and* freshness. It definitely had a bit of the ""High Fidelity"" feel, but was actually English this time. Good job!"
tt0276751,333,"What a delightful surprise! What appears to be a ""chick flick"" on the surface (complete with Hugh Grant as the male lead) turns out to be an enjoyable film that girls will love and dutiful boyfriends and husbands everywhere will be glad they went. Grant's ""slacker"" role is something that many guys can understand (if not relate to), where he just enjoys hanging out and doing ""nothing"" (playing video games, listening to music, and picking up random girls). Then along comes an awkward, yet likeable boy who becomes an unlikely friend and changes his life. Sound unlikely? Don't count this one out just yet.

Directors Chris and Paul Weitz made the smart move from gross-out comedy after turning down the sequel to their wildly successful teen comedy ""American Pie"". After almost being exiled for their Chris Rock vehicle ""Down To Earth"", the brothers fought hard to direct the adaptation of the great book by Nick Hornby (""High Fidelity""), much to the dismay of Grant (and many other Brits). As it turns out, you'll probably be as pleased as he was. This ""warm and fuzzy"" British comedy isn't too fluffy but isn't too heavy, either. It comes off as very sincere and very funny.

The score by Badly Drawn Boy fits perfectly and sets the tone for the pivotal scenes. The only awkward moment is musically, though. You'll hear Hugh Grant singing and playing guitar performing ""Killing Me Softly"". Although it's meant to be odd, yet sweet, it's a little too much. Just like ""High Fidelity"", the music is a very important part of the film and it should be duly noted.

Grant, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz, and newcomer Nicholas Hoult all give fine performances and will please all Hornby fans as everyone knows how hard it is to watch a bad adaptation of a great book. Opening against the sequel to the last lackluster ""Star Wars"" movie, this may do well for everyone who doesn't believe the hype or gets shut out. As you may remember, Grant's ""Notting Hill"" was up against ""Phantom Menace"" and did quite well.

Go check this one out and bring your significant other, no matter what the gender. This one is a definite crowd pleaser and is the best (safe) date movie in a while. Highly recommended."
tt0276751,334,"How cool is Will Freeman?

""This cool,"" British author Nick Hornby tells us a few pages into his 1998 best-seller About a Boy, the film version of which stars Hugh Grant: ""He had slept with a woman he didn't know very well in the last three months. He had spent more than three hundred pounds on a jacket."" And, to name just one more of Will's vainglorious achievements, ""He had spent more than twenty pounds on a haircut.""

In other words, Will Freeman is the kind of guy that most men aspire to be, and most women aspire to be with - whether either sex will admit it or not.

After watching Chris and Paul Weitz's adaptation of About a Boy, I'm still not sure what surprised me more: That Grant, who has made his career playing the lovable romantic bumbler (Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral), could be so perfect as the shallow cad described above. Or, that the Weitz brothers, who previously directed American Pie and the dreadful Chris Rock vehicle Down to Earth, were capable of making such a smart and often hilarious romantic comedy.

Set in its original London (unlike the last Hornby adaptation, High Fidelity, which was transplanted to Chicago), About a Boy shows how Will's carefree life - comprised of countless hours playing pool, having his hair ""carefully disheveled"" at expensive salons, eating at posh restaurants, and having meaningless sex with as many women as possible - becomes complicated when he reluctantly befriends a troubled 12-year-old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).

Is Will going to evolve? Is Marcus's friendship going to teach Will the valuable life lesson that, despite his claims to the contrary, no man is an island? You've probably seen enough movies to know the answers to these questions.

But what makes About a Boy so refreshing is that the Weitz brothers, along with co-screenwriter Peter Hedges, effectively draw out the sentimental aspects of the story without overwhelming Hornby's acerbic brand of humor. (When Will goes to a meeting for single parents as a scam to pick-up ""grateful"" women, one woman boasts a T-shirt that says ""Lorena Bobbitt for Surgeon General."")

Even Will's voice-over narration, a device commonly (mis)used by filmmakers to provide introspection, is mostly filled with sarcastic observations that consistently undermine whatever ""profound"" changes Will is experiencing.

Grant does his part to shrink the sappiness by abandoning his trademark blinking and stuttering. Rather than try to endear himself to everyone he meets, as typical in a romantic comedy, Grant seems to revel in Will's isolated, aloof existence. He gave a similar performance as the womanizing Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary, but with less charm and wit. Whereas Daniel was never trustworthy, Will parades his flaws so proudly that it's impossible not to cheer him on.

The film also features strong performances by Hoult and Toni Collette as Marcus's depressed mom. Collette could be called the female Billy Bob Thornton thanks to her chameleon-like ability to portray totally disparate characters. In the recent drama Changing Lanes she was an attractive yuppie having an affair with the ethically-challenged Ben Affleck. Here she convincingly plays a frumpy, eccentric single mom who is so depressed that she can't even make a bowl of cereal without crying.

Of course, what most people who are reading this review probably want to know is if About a Boy is a better movie than High Fidelity. It isn't. But then, High Fidelity was a better book to begin with. Most Hornby fans I meet seem to agree.

For those of you who may not already be Hornby fans, seeing About a Boy is an ideal place to start."
tt0276751,335,This is a delightful romp through a mans growing up. Hugh Grant is excellent in this role and he handles the role with much humor. There is no real message in this film and you leave the theater having been entertained for this one and half hour film. If you want to see a film with no real message and a lot of laughs go see this film.
tt0276751,336,"`About a Boy' comes to North American theaters this weekend hoping to make off with some box-office bucks as an alternative to that ho-hum sequel to `Phantom menace'. Hugh Grant did the same with `Notting Hill' back when `Episode 1' came out, quite successfully I might add, though I am sure the lack of Julia Roberts in this film may affect those box-office numbers a bit. All that useless info aside, I am happy to report that this film is a complete success! Mr. Grant is funny as ever playing yet another shade of shallow (Bridget Jones' Diary) until a young unpopular boy comes into his life to change all that. Believe me it's not as cheesy as it sounds, in fact aside from the necessary happy ending, it is anything but.

This film is based on Nick Hornby's (High Fidelity) novel of the same name, and though I've never read any of his books, I have seen and loved `High Fidelity' and can clearly see where all the original and funny dialogue comes from. Will (Grant) is depicted so well I mostly laughed out loud at just how low he went (pretending to have a child in order to get a date is a distant second to most of the other things he does here). You see the film offers narration from both Will and Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) `the boy', and is used mostly to contradict whatever impression it is they are giving to the people that surround them, the funniest scenes being near the beginning particularly during Will's dates. My quoting them here won't do justice, but surely you can imagine what the combination of Hugh Grant's character from `Bridget Jones' with dialogue and development by the guy that wrote `High Fidelity' would be like. Funny!

So, what is this film all about? Will, a man who hasn't worked a day in his life because he is still receiving `royalty fees' off his dad's Christmas Carol, and instead has spent his whole life trying to buy the perfect everything to replace human-comfort. His dates, mostly with single moms, go nowhere since he can't stand competing with their children, yet he is always right back wanting another of the same. Then we have a young boy named Marcus, highly unpopular in school, so much so that even the other unpopular kids don't want to hang with him. His mom (Collete) is suicidal but at heart loves her son it is herself she cannot live with. Will attends a single mother's support group as a desperate shot at scoring a date, he succeeds. On that date the woman announces that along with her child she will be bringing along her friends boy. And so it begins.

Will and Marcus play off each other well, Will not wanting to know anything about him and Marcus pushing to have him hang out with his mom, eventually succeeding, they become friends. It's usually at this point most films would take a predictable turn, surely a sign of relief that I could enjoy the rest of this movie when they didn't, by which I mean the boys mother and Will don't hook up. It's almost at all times a very fresh and entertaining film, casually dishing insight into the male psyche and hilariously depicting the birth of many uncommon relationships. Rachel Weisz (beauty from those `Mummy' movies) has a small but well cast role as the single mother that Will wants to hold onto.

Behind the lens we have the directors (Chris and Paul Weitz) of `American Pie' and `Down to Earth', the latter being absolutely unwatchable, which manage to shed all signs of their past few flicks. I wonder how they managed to come to such a wonderful result and in fact how much input producer Robert De Niro (surprise) had. Cinematography and editing here blend well and comedic timing is at its best.

So their you have it, charming, unexpectedly funny and smart story, and nice acting the whole way through, what more can you ask for. Indeed it goes further than that but surely you can go see for yourself. I definitely feel as though Hugh has won me over once again. `Notting Hill' and `Bridget Jones' Diary' are 2 of my favorite movies (not all time, but I definitely love them), and `About a Boy' is now part of that list. He has personified another great character, yet one that is different enough to show his skill as an actor, deserving more attention then he gets. No more `Mickey Blue Eyes' please, this guy is `A' list material."
tt0276751,337,"An excellent and thoroughly enjoyable adaptation of Hornby's book of the same title. Hugh Grant, the boy and his mother played by Toni Colette, who you will remember from 'Muriel's Wedding' are particularly good. And Grant makes the transformation from foppish English gent to the slightly more urban North London bloke with too much time on his hands, very comfortably.

The direction is also good. Nice pacey editing and an effective soundtrack help to keep the storyline moving forward at an agreeable pace."
tt0276751,338,"I got confused at the beginning and wondered who the strange women were as the film jumped around.I would have appreciated it more had i realised that it concerned the growing maturity of the main character vis a vis his young companion. I am not sure that he did in fact mature, nevertheless an enjoyable film with one or two good high-spots"

tt0276751,340,"The story of this movie is quite funny. I like the characters, the way they talked and behaved. Hugh Grant is not so bad but I think it's time for him to develop a new 'movie persona'. Though the story is enjoyable, the movie lacks the entertaining power. For my taste there's too many off-screen comments and I felt as if actors were reading the book for me. I know it's hard to make a movie out of a book, especially when the book is so much based on presenting the characters' way of thinking. But still I think that the creators should have tried harder. Or maybe their intention was to create a new type of e-book: 'movie-book'. If so, they've succeeded."
tt0276751,341,"Hugh Grant has become my favourite comic actor after films like Four Weddings, Notting Hill, and now About A Boy. I can't picture anyone else playing this role. I was a bit creeped out by how his life had similarities to mine, especially the whole breaking time down into units thing. Now if only I looked like him. Maybe if I got my hair professional messed. Anyway, this guy (or someone in his camp) knows how to pick a script, and while Hugh is pretty much just Hugh, like Cary was just Cary, there's no need for him to be anyone or anything else. And I've never seen anything funnier done with a loaf of bread!"
tt0276751,342,"Hugh Grant plays Will, who is independently wealthy because his father wrote one hit song many years ago. His house looks like a Sharper Image catalog and he drives an Audi TT, but his friends, who are all married with children, keep asking him if he wants anything more out of life. One couple asks him to be their child's godfather, and Will suggests that that would be a really bad idea.

Will gets set up with a woman who turns out to be a single mother, which surprisingly turns out pretty well for him when she breaks up with him just as he starts to tire of her (he's never had a relationship last longer then two months). So he invents an imaginary son and attends a group meeting for single parents. As a result, he eventually meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old boy. His mother (Toni Collette) is a vegetarian hippy who dresses Marcus funny, but he loves her anyway. He ends up taking a liking to Will, and the bulk of the film revolves around them. A great deal of the narrative is carried in the form of voice overs by the characters, which works but may take you a little out of the film after a while.

The acting is good. This is perhaps the most interesting role I can recall Hugh Grant playing, since he begins the film as a proudly shallow man and evolves, in fits and starts, over the course of the film. Nicholas Hoult does a convincing job of portraying a child who doesn't really fit in anywhere. Toni Collette, as my wife pointed out, is under utilized, but is still good. All in all, the film presents an interesting set of characters that I was glad to have had a chance to meet.

One interesting technique which I don't recall being used before was what I would call a pan cut. The film pans from one scene to another, so that in the middle of the pan the left half of the frame is a different scene than the right half. I guess it's just a wipe, except with the camera movement of a pan. I imagine that it was probably done digitally.

The film is based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who also wrote ""High Fidelity."" In the early parts of this film, I was really enjoying myself and felt that it was in the same league, but in the end it didn't feel as complete somehow. But since that's a pretty high standard, I would definitely still recommend this film."
tt0276751,343,"It seems strange to dismiss a cast that includes the supremely talented Toni Colette and the gorgeous Rachel Weisz, but for this film they do not matter a bit. Hugh Grant is this film, he carries it on his shoulders and does so extremely successfully. He is simply a reservation as the remarkably self-assured Will. Whereas before his agent was prone to securing him typecast roles, with support billing for his fringe, here however he has cast off the shackles of playing endlessly nice and upper class characters and his performance is easily the best of his career. There is also a superb soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy.

Recommended."
tt0276751,344,"Hornby's novel about a totally self-absorbed man who befriends (with great resistance on his part) a geeky boy was very funny, very observant and rich in character. Amazingly enough, the film is all of the above. Hugh Grant is perfect as the protagonist (""No, I really am that shallow."") as is the rest of the cast.

Marcus (the boy)'s mum is a classic. My kids went to school with her kids, and we live in another country!"
tt0276751,345,"PLOT: Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) is a slacker that... doesn't do anything. He doesn't have a solid relationship - frequent relationships that don't last long are good enough for him. After being dumped for once by a single mother, Will decides to start dating single mothers. So at a single parents' group meeting (pretending to be one), he meets and starts to date a girl who' babysitting Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) for her friend. Marcus takes a liking to Will, and starts to look at him as a father figure. He also wants him to start dating his suicidal mother (Toni Collette), but Will ends up falling for Rachel (Rachel Weisz), and he wants Marcus to pretend to be his son to win her heart.

MY TAKE: About a Boy is one of the most consistently funny movies I've seen all year. It doesn't present a single original idea, but it manages to win the audience over. All the performances are great, especially from the two main leads (Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult). Grant's character can be a real jerk, but he comes across as likeable. Hoult manages to be cute without becoming annoying. There are many jokes that are laugh-out-loud hilarious, and the jokes are all very consistent. The movie definitely isn't perfect, but it's charming and hilarious."
tt0276751,346,"This is the kind of film/movie Hollywood can't make. Its original and unpredictable. Just when you think you know what will happen SOMETHING else happens and you think...that was both unpredictable and realistic.

One of the best movies I have seen in years. You can take your mom or your beer drinking friends. And Hugh Grant can play a different role!"
tt0276751,347,"There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. It seems short, but thats probably because its really entertaining. Everyone does a good job in this and the voice over work is really well done. I haven't read the book, so obviously I can't compare it to anything, but if more movies this summer are this entertaining, I think we are in for a good summer at the movies.. Thanks"
tt0276751,348,"Nick Hornby's 1998 bestseller is turned into a lively screenplay written and co-directed by Chris and Paul Weitz ( the raunchy ""American Pie""), also co-written by PeterHedges (a superb ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?""). The script compliments the classic Hornby sense of articulate Londoners driven by obsessive-compulsive pursuits. The peculiar creative powers behind the project turn out genuinely amusing and consistently entertaining film that boasts nicely rounded and amiable characters. By avoiding the syrup the picture doesn't fall into a predictable groove. It manages to avoid the banality of majority mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies but, regretfully, lacks the underlying philosophical concept(the brilliant ""GroundHog Day"") that could elevate it to a classic.

There are two significant London-centered trilogies that originated in the 1990s. One - the Richard Curtis triptych of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diaries"" - has Hugh Grant starring in all of them. The other is the Nick Hornby trilogy of ""Fever Pitch"", ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"". Unlike in overpraised ""High Fidelity"", in which Stephen Frears, its British director (with John Cusack, a manic American equivalent to Grant) transferred that novel's plot from London to Chicago, the book's London setting is preserved here (apparently Chris Weitz has a first-hand understanding of English culture acquired during his studies at Cambridge).

""About a boy"" - the name is a take on Nirvana's 'About a girl' - could have been titled just the same ""About Two Boys"". It is in essence a coming-of-age story squared. Not only is it about the smug and egocentric slacker and idle wealthy bachelor, Will Freeman, a character played by Grant, it is also about a pubescent loner dork, Marcus. Murcus' problems stem from his New Agey and seriously depressive mother who wishes to impose her rigid 1980s counter-cultural conformity on her son. Through his unlikely accord with Marcus, the story's catalyst, Will is eventually dragged kicking and screaming into the human race. Solipsists may be plugged into popular culture but they surely are utterly detached from actual people. 'Every man is an island' (Will lives his life as if his were Ibiza, a trendy European summertime playground ), but more often than not islands are invisibly connected into archipelagos. Island living may guarantee happy seclusion - 'Freeman' is all Will ever wants to be - but it also offers solitude and emotional retardation. ""The Will Show"" - aided by a series of great voice-over, self-satisfied pop referencing riffs - becomes an ""ensemble drama"". A cad ultimately is turned into a lad.

Will's life springs into uncharted territory with the discovery of a brand new world of attention-starved single moms waiting to be conquered. Commitment is the enemy and single moms make good lays. Single mothers are less demanding and easier to dump than single girls. He infiltrates SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together - a pick-up heaven of perfect dating prey.

Much of the film's success comes from Will Freeman's flashy politically incorrect characterization. He is a ""selfish b*****d"", in love with his lifestyle carefully scheduled into ""units"", with specific numbers of them allotted for one-night stands, expansive haircuts, cd-shopping, and watching TV game shows (It is not impossible that Hollywood may take notice of this phenomenon, leave studio cowardice aside and instead of endless and repetitive stream of anemic parts give us more colorful and unconventional characters). Hugh Grant brings Will's character to life in a grand manner. His versatile facial vocabulary, always with the hint of an edge, is fully tapped. Most male stars tend to be judged by their actions or the values they embody. With Grant, it is all about seeing thoughts and emotions cross and transform his face. Here, more subtly and convincingly than ever before. In ""About a Boy"", Grant is more than a star, he is a resource.

With this handsome production The Weitz Bro's are now giving Cameron Crowe a run for his mainstream pop money."
tt0276751,349,"Hugh Grant is back playing his standard, bumbling, fish out of water character - albeit in a film that virtually differs by title only to Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diaries. Try as they might, the films directors could draw no more than the usual linear performance out of Sunset Boulevards favourite Englishman. And why should they even try? About a Boy will undoubtedly be a success. This is not a film that asks you any questions, nor is it a film that will move you. It's just a cheery, seamless extension of Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diaries. If you like that sort of movie, then you'll love About a Boy. The script is just about witty and clever enough to suggest that Nick Hornby's book, on which the film is based, is worth reading, and there are one or two laughs along the way. Hornby must feel sold short, though, by the particularly low quality acting of Grant, Nicholas Hoult, (who plays the boy) and the rest of the cast. High Fidelity and Fever Pitch are far better adaptations of Hornby's work. Grant is the least well-placed actor to complain about being typecast (with the possible exception of Vinnie Jones) when he delivers the same persona in every film, regardless of his role or the plot."
tt0276751,350,"About a boy shares a lot of its humour not only with the likes of its predcessors of Bridget Jones and A fish called Wanda but also plays upon the humour within the British consciousness also. Hugh Grant plays his stock character of a runaway cad whose heart gets surgically put back into the right place by the end of the film and all acting is above par but not excellent from the ensemble cast.

Nicholas Hoult who plays the trouble child is maybe trying a bit too hard to be Haley Joel Osment to no avail as his acting falls short of the mark but hey the kids about 12 so i won't be too harsh on him!

overall its a nice British comedy, i say British as no offence or patronisim meant but alot of the Brit tv references will be lost on the US audience, that moves swiftly along with sliding frames and easy editing that makes this a kick off your slippers and relax kinda movie to see.

nothing special but we Brits aren't known for that. more of a meandering comedy that quietly delights the average cinema goer."
tt0276751,351,"I caught a promotional screening of this last night here in Orlando, Florida. As it so happened, I ended up seated next to the film critic for one of our local papers. He fell asleep about 45 minutes in. I envied him.

Hugh Grant and the other actors do a fine job with a really predictable script here. The through-line is SO obvious from the word go, I found the movie unbearably tedious. I have to admire the performers, who had to make something out of some dire made-for-TV witticisms and contrivances. Will the man-boy learn to be a better person? Will the suicidal mother find her way? Will the young boy get a new dad? Will Hugh come to grips with his memories of his late boozer songwriter Dad?

I didn't care, and it wasn't because these aren't very likeable actors. It was just painfully slow-paced, repetitive and downbeat. Even the occasional bits of comedy felt lead heavy and forced."
tt0276751,352,"I could probably write a whole lot of stuff about this movie that everyone else might talk about, but I won't. I'll tell you about one thing I liked. About a boy was really strange to me before hand. I had no idea what it was going to be about, but it was a free ticket so I decided to go and see it. I was surprised to see Nick Hornby's name in the credits. I knew he was a book writer who was very good so I was quite pleased when I read his name.

What I found that made the film good was that it was like watching a book. Yes, watching a book. There was clever use of voice over in certain points to put across what the character involved might be thinking. Normally their thoughts were rather funny as they contradicted what was being said. That was one point of this film that I enjoyed.

But, hey don't take my word for it. Go and see it yourself. The world of cinema would be a boring place if everyone listened to critics. Oh what am I saying? A lot of people do listen to critics.

I give it 7 out of 10. Enjoyable movie which made me laugh and smile, therefore it did it's job."
tt0276751,353,The sort of movie your girlfriend makes you see and you hate it. i was very surprised Hugh Grant was genuinely funny and the movie had a couple of high points in it. The scene where HG sings Killing me softly on guitar and backing out of being a childs godfather because he was self centred and shallow - Some predictable crap and what a watse of rachel Weisz the most pointless part she has ever played all in all though great sat afternoon time wasting.
tt0276751,354,"Reading the book before seeing the film sets you up for a certain degree of disappointment. A book that has been part of your life for the best part of a week (or more) is reduced to one and a half hours of the main plotline. I had also misread the hype. The film is from the makers of Bridget Jones Diary; it is actually written and directed by two American guys, the Weitz Brothers. Their film credits include Antz (for which they wrote script) and America Pie.

The plotline parallels the lives of two boys, thirty-five year old Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) and twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Will lives in a stylish apartment full of the latest technology and gadgets. His laidback lifestyle is funded by royalties from a novelty record his father wrote before he was born. He is happy drifting though life minimising his contact with others, except for the occasional sexual encounter. Marcus is not happy. He lives with his mother, a woman with strong beliefs who has been rendered emotional weak for reasons never fully explained. Eventually these two boys meet and a reluctant friendship develops.

Hugh Grant's performance is his best to date. His delivery of the narration, in a dry, sardonic style, hints of the hidden depths that he assures his friends do not exist. The film is very much his. Toni Collette gives an excellent performance as the alternate' single mother who fails to appreciate her son's problems. And, despite my aversion, to child actors Nicholas Hoult delivered a very credible performance as the child who is struggling to cope in environments he can not control. The casting of child actors seem to have gradually improved as producers (*see below) have endeavoured to provide real' children and not cute' or precocious' child stars.

The film has its weaknesses. The best lines have been lifted from Nick Hornby's book. Whilst its first three-quarters adhere to the book, it then diverts into a crisis incident before concluding with a scene that is again Hornby territory. Whilst there is nothing wrong with this construction it wasn't quite enough. The magic is also missing in its humour, that is not to say it is not funny, it is, although not as roaringly so as the hype would have you believe. Perhaps I went to this movie knowing too much and expected something extra to be delivered. I exited with a feeling it was enjoyable but  Maybe Will's words express what I felt was missing, `Ah that's where you have me wrong. You've always thought I had hidden depths. But I really am this shallow.'

* I not 100% sure who is responsible for casting decisions, but as the producers are in charge of the money I decided the ultimate decision was probably theirs."
tt0276751,355,"I saw this by accident. I was on my way to see 'Roadkill' and had missed the start by 30 mins, and this was the only thing starting when I got there. I normally HATE these 'brit comedies' with a passion but this was GREAT. It's got humorous elements to it, but it deals with some suprisingly deep issues. It's very touching and moving at bits, and I didn't actually want to punch Hugh Grant's smug face in for a change. His character is brilliant - from what I've seen of his acting this film is definitely his best. Really really well done. And Rachel Weisz is in it which is always a nice thing :-)"
tt0276751,356,"I don't quite know what to think of this movie. The story can be a bit confusing if you try to sum it up in a few words, so I don't. It's a backdrop to the characters anyway, and to see how they impact each other's lives.

Take a shallow, and I mean SHALLOW guy, too much money and time on his hands and a fairly hedonist outlook on life. Oh, and he's as self-centred as a human being can get before declaring himself god. Then take a geeky boy with a terribly depressed mother, isolated and bullied because of his extreme geekiness. Make them the dual narrators of the movie, with their very different perspectives. Put the two in front of a TV set for a few consecutive afternoons. See how / whether they affect each other's thinking and actions, how they help each other become more acceptable human beings.

This movie mixes laughs and humour with some well-drawn characters. But at some stage, their interactions become completely unbelievable. Especially the confrontations between the boy's mother and Hugh Grant's character in the restaurant (and later in the seemingly product-placed Audi) reek of unrealistic and poor writing. The writers succeeded in creating realistic and genuine characters. They failed at getting their interactions believable.

On the humour side, yes, there were lots of opportunities to laugh. Although, most of the laughs weren't the merry, innocent and delighted sort you get from silly slapstick. The characters were too well-defined for that, so while it was funny, it was also slightly melancholic. Comparing this with Bridget Jone's diary, you'll get a very similar kind of humour and laughter and even narration. Oh, and identifying with the geeky boy more than just a little bit, half my laughs were through clenched teeth and a sour expression. Oh, the memories of school!

Not bad for a comedy, even quite clever. But too close to real life to be the kind of comedy I like.

7/10"
tt0276751,357,"Bloody brilliant! For the first time in an age a British movie, albeit written and directed by a pair of American brothers, hits every spot it aims at. Funny, touching and believable, this is going to be one to see again and again. Hugh Grant may be playing Hugh Grant yet again, but when he gets the really right Hugh Grant part he really is perfect for it."
tt0276751,358,"A good film, where Hugh Grant does well with a script not quite up to previous he's starred in. I've never read the book & doubt I ever will, but nevertheless enjoyed the film.

It amazes me people make so much of Grant playing a 'reasonably' similar character in most of his roles. John Wayne made an entire living out of that. So did James Stewart as the unfortunate but likeable bloke & Cary Grant as loveable rogue and for the same reason, because they were great at it. In any case, in About a Boy, his role was fairly different to any of his others, probably closest to the Bridget Jones role.

The film was itself was highly enjoyable, but I didn't find it overly funny. Granted there were quite a few funny scenes, but little that had you in hysterics. Occasionally the plot seemed to lose a little direction but the most irritating thing had to be Marcus's hair. Lets hope we're not going down the American road with that childs style. There was an ideal opportunity about half way through for him to have it cut too.

I felt slightly disappointed coming out, but only due to the high standard of these sorts of films that preceeded it. Four Weddings, Notting Hill were brilliant & Mickey Blue Eyes & Bridget Jones very good, and Bend it Like Beckham running simultaneously next door slightly better.

But this was good, recommendable & had lots to offer for all viewers, male, female, young, old etc, but just didn't quite hit the heights it could have.

7/10"
tt0276751,359,"I must admit, I went to see this film to appease my other half. So how does Hugh manage to pull off such an acting triumph - he manages to persuade us he is a two dimensional character with no hidden depths (as is the way with things that are two dimensional) he was a charmless man with no apparent thought for anyone but himself, I couldn't help warming to him. It did deal with a big issue in a less than sombre way thats not to say that it was lighthearted in its approach, but the scene was necessary not only to show the boys situation with his mum, it also showed the inept way Hugh dealt with the situation along with the aftermath. The ending was cliche but thats because it couldn't have ended any other way. All in all good performances and well worth going to see."
tt0276751,360,"Having watched a collection of 'Chick Flicks' over the last 18 months, I went to see this film with great fear that a great story could be morphed into a girlie movie. Boy was I wrong! This is a movie for all the guys out there that wonder what life would be like to sit home all day and not worry about life. Okay, finally we are given the fact that its not all a bed of hot chilli flavoured noodles with a nice cold lager, but in all, every man at one point has wished for Will's way of life. Although after awhile you get the feeling that you may be watching a remake of the Micheal Caine film ""Alfie"", the narration in the background, the feeling of uncaring views of women, and a change of life moment....

Hugh's new hair gives him a better feel of the kind of guy you want to be and seems to have kicked into the feel good factor of his position. With a kitchen full of appliances that, more than likely, he has no idea of how to use, wide screen TV and the lasting complaint that he loves his DVD's and IMAX, he gives the impression that in the wrong environment, a man will never grow up. All that seemed to be missing was a Playstation 2 or XBox!

The movie travels along at a fair pace and gives you the laughs in the right places and allows the guys being dragged out to what they might think is the Chick Flick of the week, to enjoy the film without thinking that they are being shown the way they should be (as any man who's date swooned at Mr Darcy in Bridget Jones will attest to!).

My only complaint is that with the soundtrack being done by Badly Drawn Boy, it achieves a samey character all the way through and doesn't quite help, not something to rush out and buy because it reminds you of a scene.

Recommendations for the DVD from heaven... Will's guide to dating, alternative soundtrack, outtakes of the school hall scene, more Rachel!"
tt0276751,361,"A somewhat annoying vehicle for Hugh Grant's new haircut.

The irony that oozes from all Hornby's work has been completely lost and the film is devoted to a coy 'Hedonistic Bloke discovers family values and becomes New Man' plotline.

Hugh Grant does extremely well in an attempt to overcome miscasting but he can only do so much. He could never play the selfish, slacker, one-of-the-boys character the film desperately needs

The rest of the cast avoid walking into the scenery as the film heads for one of the cheesiest finales yet foistered on the general public.

It's been very accurately described elsewhere as 'Four Notting Hills and a Diary'

Richard Curtis has a lot to answer for.

On a more positive note, Toni Collette as the single mum is brilliant."
tt0276751,362,"This has to be Hugh Grants least annoying film. Not just a chick flick, this well-paced, lively and entertaining movie tackles issues such as loneliness and the importance of friendship. Hughs' Norf-Lahndan accent is not as embarrassing as Dick Van-Dykes' either. Warmly recommended. 8/10"
tt0276751,363,"About a Boy is witty, exactly what you expect from a Nick Hornby adaptation. It has a few archetypal characters to provide laughs a la Jack Black in High Fidelity, but the two leads are fully developed characters. Will, who is funny enough to make you love him right off the bat to begin with, evolves into a person the audience can connect with. Although, of course, we shake our heads at much of what he is doing, we still find a a piece of him within us all, which is the real joy of the film."
tt0276751,364,"Very well done. Hugh Grant plays against type as a thoroughly-selfish individual who finds redemption through his (initially unwilling) friendship with a young boy. This was extremely funny for those brought up in the English tradition of irony and self-deprecation so it may lose its audience on the other side of the Atlantic (except in New York and San Francisco): my companion, though, was Romanian and she found it hilarious - so I may be taking too-jaundiced a line there. Highly recommended: go and see it for no other reason than you'll be glad you did."
tt0276751,365,"Hugh Grant plays a Will, man who does nothing, but does it all very well. He buys stuff, plays billiards, watches TV, gets his hair done, and dates women. He doesn't want or need relationships or emotional attachment, he is an island - he is Ibiza.

But all this changes went through a life changing moment for a boy - newcomer Nicholas Hoult - this boy attaches himself to Will and they both become better for it.

The movie is entertaining, well scripted, winningly acted and well put together, but it is not without its flaws including being predictable and seems to make light of what many would think is a serious situation, but it's a movie so how really cares."
tt0276751,366,"While I believe that Grant put on a great performance, but overall, I think that this movie was horrible-- annoying characters and sub-par acting. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is only a waste of time (I almost walked out on 5 occasions)"
tt0276751,367,"This film does justice to the book. The fact that it dealt with difficult issues in such a sensitive and yet humorous manner is a big plus point. This was Hugh Grant at his best but I was very impressed with Nicholas Hoult as the boy. His acting showed a fine depth of talent which should hold him well if he is going to follow acting as a career. His portrayal of Marcus is excellent so that the character in the book comes across on screen as one would imagine. Well done Nicholas and obviously a tribute must go to the Directors and Hugh Grant for enhancing and developing his incipient talent. All in all a must see film and an assured enjoyable outing. For film buffs and memorabilia collectors such as myself,I look forward to the stills etc."
tt0276751,368,"This is a stale uninspiring film. It produces more smiles than laughs. It doesn't have a strong female character. Grant's accent is awful. The kid's hair is just too awful.

If you catch one rom-com this year, don't make it this."
tt0276751,369,"Oh my god. What is (was) wrong with you all? This has a 7? I couldn't laugh with this movie. I couldn't feel sorry for the kid. I couldn't feel ANY sense of this being romantic in the least.

Grant has to be, buck for buck, the worst actor ever (again, considering the money he won by being a tall not-completely-model-like english bland man).

Anyways. Some sappy shallow unrealistic scenes are hard to watch without being embarrassed. And Grant finds out that having a family is the key to happiness, of course. Never mind that he can be with Rachel Weisz! That's not ""truly important"". Im still rolling my eyes."
tt0276751,370,"I didn't know it was based on a book (obviously, never read it), so I'm judging it as a stand-alone movie, and, as such, it's pretty good.

The story itself is not very realistic, but... maybe it's not supposed to be.

I like London movies, and I think Hugh Grant is one of the most talented actors ever. Rachel Weisz is also very good, but her role in this movie was relatively small, and her character is unremarkable (slightly unlikeable, actually).

The actress, who plays the boy's Mother, was very good at portraying a suicidal hippie -- she looked the part. I was glad to see they didn't bring in a famous actress for that role; it would've probably spoilt it.

I would've liked it if Hugh Grant and the boy's Mother got together in the end, and if she got a makeover or something -- it would've been more interesting, but... oh, well.

The child actors did a good job. All of them.

And, obviously, they couldn't have found a better actor to play the lead. That role was made for Hugh Grant. No one else could have pulled it off.

All in all, a good movie if you're looking for some light-hearted entertainment. I'd watch it again."
tt0276751,371,"On my roommate's recommendation, I got a hold of this film and watched it on a night where I hadn't a whole lot to do otherwise. And... it wasn't bad.

When I saw Hugh Grant on the cover, I was a bit skeptical that I would be wandering into another romantic comedy. But then I saw that it was based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who wrote the novel High Fidelity, upon which the movie by the same name is based and I liked High Fidelity plenty, especially considering that it's a romantic comedy. So I let down my guard.

And I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another run-of-the-mill story, but rather, it was about... a boy. And a man. Or is the man a boy? No science fiction here, it's just a story about a older man learning what it means to be a human being through an expected mentor/friend relationship with a kid 1/3 his age. The characters are interesting and developed, even if the story is as clear as plastic wrap and the plotting obvious. But I like the story anyway, even if during the film, I still had doubts now and again.

I did have one little qualm with the film, and that is that it's directed like every mainstream British comedy that I've seen, complete with the sad-montage sequence with some pop tune coursing through the film. But at least the characters were so well done, it didn't bother me too much that the film didn't really have much of a personality, at least artistically.

So, it's essentially, a nice very straightforward story, with well developed characters and a very predictable (almost boring) style. Not a bad way to spend a Saturday night alone. Or with the people you love. 7/10."
tt0276751,372,"I haven't yet read Nick Hornby's book ""About A Boy"" to know if the screenwriter changed much or if the Weitz Brothers as directors softened the tone to be more redemptive. Becaise what is it about contemporary fans of Billy Wilder like Cameron Crowe and the Weitzes that they can't bring themselves to be as cynical?

At least it wasn't as schmaltzy as the previews made it out to be. The younger titular boy is more quirky and desperate for a father figure and Hugh Grant's eccentric involvement with him is believably gradual. Critics are wrong that this is Grant's first misanthropic role; they must not have seen ""An Awfully Big Adventure,"" though his haircut here is much better.

Nice to see a couple of the women from my favorite Brit TV shows.

The Badly Drawn Boy soundtrack is lovely.

tt0276751,373,"This is one of the types of 'films', that I could identify somewhat with the slew of characters or feel emotionally involved in the movie. The scripting and character plots were simply brilliant. This is a witty movie of substance and humour and deserves a perfect rating in my books.

Hugh Grant performed his role well and was quite convincing. I know how it is to be approaching the 30's, without a real girlfriend with no definite plans of marrying anyone, and not be established in any way as a person with something going to really talk about.

Personally, I'm not ready for any real relatoinship, but when everyone else around you has either married someone, or has a girlfriend then you feel weird. I imagine being 38 would be allot worst - unemployed and no girlfriend or family. Immediately, when I saw that intro-picture, I knew this movie was meant for me and felt involved with the characters.

It had elements of trying to succeed with women, similar in themes to ""Hitch"", where a prop of being a single dad is used to score on would be single mom's. It appears that creating a fictitious child could score well on hitting on a single mom to shag her - if you could keep the story together. I thought the whole skit was bold and very convincing. However, I don't think I would try that myself to try and get a girl. However, in this movie, Hugh won the jackpot in the end.

Rated 10/10."

oh my god you've gotten fat - Edna mode"
tt0276751,375,"I'd heard some interesting comments about this movie, and that it was going to be much better than the spate of previous romantic comedies as well as the latter films of Hugh Grant - although wouldn't they be one and the same? Needless to say I was disappointed.

I think where this movie started failing for me, for it does start off very well, is in the uniqueness of the boy and his mother. The two characters are presented as far out from an identifiable character as possible that they can't be reached by the audience. Sure, you can identify with a few aspects of their character, but they definitely stop being real.

The character of Will is very close to being identifiable with, and so the audience can believe in him and feel emotion for him at the right times. Yet not for the boy or the mother, I mean when the boy declares to Will how recent events have upset him and really affected him, I felt sad and some empathy, but connection with my past or the character just didn't come. If only they'd injected a small part of reality into them then it would have.

There's also a slight trouble with the clunkiness of some of the dialogue and choices that Will makes. His character is one that believes that ""a man can be an island...I'm bloody Ibiza!"", yet he makes some absurd against character choices and statements. For example when he says he really enjoys Christmas with the most bizarre bunch of people, yet he's clearly not. His character could have come to the same conclusions and the story taken the same journey, just with a bit more of a real view.

Still, there are some excellent moments, the argument in the bar over Marcus coming to his house when his mother suggests he's been interfering with him is both awkward and funny, an excellently built scene.

One good thing for Grant out of all this is that the movie does a good job of dispelling his previous movie parts, and he really does do a good job of what he's given.

However, the poor moments did make me roll my eyes and took me straight out of the movie. Light entertainment, and not much more."
tt0276751,376,"My father and I read Hornby's novel at separate times and both loved it, so when he saw the movie and proclaimed its excellence, I moved it up my list of movies to see. When I finally got around to it, I was hooked, laughing aloud at numerous points, but was ultimately disappointed. By moving the story to the present day, from the book's 1994, a crucial plot point involving Kurt Cobain had to be discarded, and what ended up being the last ten minutes of the film had to be created from scratch. While my father felt the reworked conclusion was in the spirit of the movie, I thought it was wholly unbelievable and didn't actually accomplish the goal the rest of the picture had so wonderfully worked to set up. Additionally, reworking the ending in such a way should have had the ripple effect of reworking other scenes so that fewer characters would be introduced, but they weren't. Thus, several characters were brought into the story, plot lines involving them were touched on, and they were never paid off, which hurts the film even if the viewer hasn't read the novel. All in all though, it's smart, quotable, and a great reminder that Hugh Grant can make looking uncomfortable funnier than anyone not named Ben Stiller."
tt0276751,377,"""About a Boy"" is a Brit flick about a happily eligible and independently well off bachelor (Grant) who learns from a boy (Hoult) that his self absorbed life may be needing something more. Clever, wry, and witty with plaudits aplenty, the fun in this flick is in the slightly skewed and skewering take on the shallow protagonist. There's are some poignant moments but precious little romance in this tale of one man's awakening from a life of sleep walking and the discovery that a man can be an island unto himself as long as he's part of an archipelago. (B+)"
tt0276751,378,"Hugh Grant has done better movies than this one. Save your hard earned money and watch Grant's other stuff instead. The rest of the cast are practically ""nobodies"". Hugh Grant is usually a funny guy. If you put him in front of a camera for two hours and had him do improvisations it would probably have been more fun."
tt0276751,379,"Aptly named protagonist and bachelor, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant), disputes the claim ""No man is an island"" in the 2002 comedy About A Boy. He believes that one can venture through life's halls without having any serious or meaningful relationships. Yet, Will Freeman's assumptions are tested when young Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) enters his life. Through a series of unfortunate events and somewhat genuine attempts at reform, Will embarks on a journey that could change him forever.

About A Boy is a nice adaptation of the equally named 1998 novel. At its best, it offers a glimpse at the necessity in quality human interaction to prevent depression and suicide. At its worst, it is a corny, ill-paced, Hallmark Channel-esque rip off. Nicholas Hoult's performance as young Marcus Brewer is not astounding, but it maintains a level of honesty while directing the flow of the story. Hugh Grant is, well, Hugh Grant. What he lacks in depth he makes up with that old British charm and a musical performance.

The film's dialogue succeeds when it employs casual banter and awkward scenarios between Will and Marcus. But, other than basic sound editing for room tone, there is nothing special within. This film is all about character development and story. This works well in novel format, but the transition to the big screen leaves the eyes and ears wanting. As for the ensemble, the characters are believable for their environment, but there is little or no energy.

About A Boy, did however offer material on which I could ponder. It ably taught the valuable lesson: people need people. For its discussion on family matters and depression, it gets an A. As for all other requisites, About A Boy requires summer school."
tt0276751,380,"Another Hugh Grant comedy. Liked him before? U will probably like him now. In ""About a Boy"" Hugh Grant's character wants to be an ""island"": no attachments to wife or kids, just living as a bachelor, living of royalties and watching movies and dating women day in day out. With lots of millions in his bank account he doesnt need to work so he fills his days with pleasures. The ideal young man's dreamlife. Untill a boy crosses his path whom he is forced to take care of. Will he like it? Or will he dump the kid?

This Hugh Grant flick is really heartfelt and endearing. Hugh Grant plays his usual whining but witty self. But this time a kid plays a lead character too. It is not a kids movie perse, although kids could really enjoy it too, because it deals with many issues kids who get bullied have to deal with. ""About A Boy"" deals with some heavy family issues, but they are all wrapped in lighthearted comedy. It never becomes heavy, no way. It is sugarcoated and witty with a happy ending ofcourse. Lovely, funny, family oriented Hugh Grant flick. For young and old."
tt0276751,381,"About a boy, is a dramatic, romantic comedy which is directed by the brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. It's about a man named Will Freeman who has no interest in children, long lasting relationship or responsibility what so ever. But is in for a ride when he meets Marcus, a boy in need for a male role model and a third family member, since his mother is mentally unstable and Marcus figures, she needs a man in her life.

The actors i feel worth mentioning, who made their performance believable and shook life in their characters were Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and Fiona Brewer (Toni Colette). Nicholas doesn't get by on cute looks, like far too many kid actors, because he can actually act and shows that child actors are just as, if not more so, capable as their elders. Toni Colette, convincing as a mentally unstable single mother, you can nothing but feel empathy for her characters mental situation, it has come to a point in her life were nothing could make her happy. She was nothing more than adaptable to her characters life crisis.

About the message of this movie, it's always hard to tell exactly since i don't think its ever written in stone, there are many views on just that subject. My view is, children of divorced parents, and how this is hard on both the child and the parent. It could also be about the difficulties of growing up in a society where it's hard to find who you really are, without following the crowd, you might get beaten, or bullied, but at least you're creating your own path."
tt0276751,382,"Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors; he is such a sweet guy (On-screen) that as many times I come across any new or old movie of him – I again and again fall in love with him. I believe he is one of the most underrated actors of his own times. Barring a very few of his movies – I have almost seen all more then once. This was one of those exceptionally brilliant feel good movies. In this movie, Hugh Grant is a well off guy surviving on his dad's royalties, having a good time doing nothing but watching TV. He dates a single mother but unfortunately their relationship ends amicably, soon comes up with an idea to date single mothers only by joining a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). What life throws on him is a hilarious ride and how it all ends is simply superb, it actually made me laugh out loud like crazy, totally loved his straight face comedy. The guy even when in so much trouble makes a damn good face and tries to walk out of trouble in his own ways. Watch out for the last scene and his performance on stage – you will be in splits for sure. It's a damn good one time watch especially for those who love clean comedies. Not to be missed.

The Movie: As I mentioned earlier, Hugh is such a nice guy even in this movie that all his antics sound and look so genuine. His frustrations, confusions, reactions, even when he blurts out something in anger, it makes me laugh big time. Like it happens in this movie couple of times. The story is very simple and straight forward of a guy ""Will"" (Hugh Grant), who practically does nothing for a living as his dad composed some Christmas songs and the royalty coming from the same is more than enough for him to live a comfortable life. One fine day he meets a single mother but just in a couple of days he realizes they aren't meant to be together but since he is a nice guy and cares for her feelings – it's very hard for him to break off with her. To his shock, even she had the same feeling and they call it off amicably. But with this relationship he realizes one thing that its easy to be in a relationship with a single mother, have a good time and move on to the next, without any commitment or responsibility. During one of his grocery shopping trips he comes across an ad talking about a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), he joins them and claims that he has a two year old son whose currently gone with his separated wife. There he meets another parent and goes around with her. During one of their picnic trips, he meets her friend's 12 year old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). What happens in the picnic is hilarious stuff as Marcus kills a duck with a loaf of bread but Will saves him by creating a story, with which Marcus gets pretty impressed and develops a bond with him gradually.

Marcus's mother too is a single parent and she tries committing suicide but somehow she is saved by Will and her neighboring friend who Will was dating previously. Marcus tries Will to date his mom to save her from loneliness but after their first date he follows Will and realizes that he neither has a kid nor is a divorcée. Marcus being a smart kid blackmails his way to his home and gets an access to Will's house as and when he wishes. They develop quite a good bond as they go out together and Will does helps him on couple of things, they do spend some good time together at Will's house. It was damn good to see Marcus's popularity starts growing in his school and he too ends up going around with a hot tom boyish girl Ellie (Natalia Tena), in the meantime Will too comes across Rachel (Rachel Weisz) and he uses Marcus as his own son to appear interesting to her. How they all meet and what goes around with Rachel's son and Marcus is hilarious, finally they end up breaking off as well and finally Will and Marcus too fight it off between themselves. What happens next and how it falls all over in right place is a classic ending. The last half an hour off the movie is too good with thinks going out of hands but again falling in right places. Marcus's social suicide even after his girl friends warning is too good and how Will saves him on stage is one hell of a scene. The way they have used one of my favorite songs ""Killing me softly"" here – it had me in splits. I am sure comedy lovers will enjoy this one big time."
tt0276751,383,"The British film About a Boy was considered one of the best of 2002, being placed on the American Film Institute's top 10 list of that year and has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But does it hold up? Will (Hugh Grant) is a selfish 38-year-old man who leads a live of leisure. He lives off the royalties of a song his father wrote so does not need to work at all. One of his big interests is woman and discovers the untapped market of single mothers. This is how he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a 12-year-old boy with a depressed mother (Toni Collette) and is a social outcast. After Marcus' mother tries to kill herself Will and Marcus are forced into each other's lives and an unusual friendship starts to develop.

The winning aspects of About a Boy is a witty script by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges and a great performance by Grant. Grant is great playing a selfish, self-centred man thinking only of himself who is forced to grow up and become responsible. Grant has great comic timing through and given good lines throughout. Some of the best moments is the use of narration and when it relations to the actual conversations on screen. There are natural relationships between the characters and the drama was well handled.

The rest of the cast was also strong and the Weitz brothers certainly keep the film going at both a steady pace and make it visual. There is strong chemistry between everyone and the Weitz Brothers know where to find a good editor. They also know how to subtly move the camera and use trick to enhance the film and About a Boy is easily their best film.

It is not a perfect film like the Rotten Tomatoes scores suggest and the 7.2 on IMDb is more fair. If you do not like drama-comedy About a Boy is not going to win you over and this film has more of a wit then outright laughs. Plus the third act felt very rushed as Will finds a love interest in the form of Rachel (Rachel Weisz, who was underused) and Marcus suddenly befriending an older girl, Ellie (Natalia Tena) when we should have seen more of her. Plus the children at the school and their behaviour did not feel real, it did feel like what real children do or act like.

About a Boy is a fair enough film, but it is not quite my cup of tea."

tt0276751,385,"""About a Boy"" is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made. It is one of the rare movies that accomplishes a goal of being heartwarming in a world where ""heartwarming"" generally means something along the lines of films as nauseating as ""Titanic."" Fortunately, the heart in ""About a Boy"" is a genuine kind, a real kind of warmth that becomes obvious right at the get-go. Hugh Grant gives his career's best performance as a slacker without a heart of gold, and Nicholas Hoult makes an impressive debut as Marcus, the tormented boy who teaches good ol' Hugh Grant to grow up. The only bad performance in this movie is from a loaf of bread. Remi Adefarasin's cinematography is definitely eye-catching, and the music by Badly Drawn Boy has to be one of the best scores in motion picture history.

It tells of the importance and power of selflessness - that it is necessary for people to receive it from others to find happiness - through the character development of Hugh Grant's shallow, egotistical character. His lifestyle of meaningless sequence seems to change when he meets a twelve-year-old boy (bright film newcomer Nicholas Hoult), who teaches him essentially how he can help others in life.

tt0276751,388,"I decided to watch this movie after seeing it in the recommendation board of ""Dear Frankie"". To be honest it is not a bad movie but after you watched ""Dear Frankie"" and expected a similar quality you get disappointed. It tells about the story of a displaced and lonely kid's friendship with a socially undeveloped man in his late 30s. First of all the kid(played by 1989 born Nicholas Hoult) doesn't perform well. It doesn't just fit there you know. I could not find the spirit of a displace,lonely,socially inept kid in his performance. This movie advances in double voice-over which gives us the opportunity to read both Marcus(the boy)'s thoughts and the man(Hugh Grant as Will)'s thoughts but at some point you just feel that there is too much voice-over! It just passes there in Will's flat and you start asking questions: Why the heck don't I see somewhere else? Why don't I see something more private into Marcus's relationship with his mother? Why the heck Will doesn't date with Susie(the friend of Marcus's mum). Well I am sort of a viewer who questions the plot always and I these question just left there.Plus the story of a displaced kids should have been covered with a tag like ""the best comedy of the year"" This is supposed to be real life not just some comical crap! I would suggest you see ""Dear Frankie""(a movie which is really under-rated-voted by around 3500 people only so far) then decide whether About A Boy is really good."

When this unlikely pair find each other they form a life-changing relationship which helps both overcome the difficulties one another are experiencing.

The best part about the movie was the story. It was interesting and well told. Plus there are a few laughs thrown in. It was different than the usual Hollywood fluff.

tt0276751,403,"If not for two positive things about this movie, I would have crucified it with a 4 or less! I like Hugh Grant a lot. Fortunately, he is almost as charming in this movie as any other time. I think he would make a good Bond - post Brosnan. And, the last 20 minutes or so were redeemable. But, that's about it.

I can't comprehend how so many people gave this movie such high marks. The first hour plus was torturously slow and boring. I disliked most of the characters - and utterly loathed the kid's mom. In fact, the kid, himself, was barely tolerable until near the end and even then was (AT BEST) average. Worse, he was the co-star of the movie.

Furthermore, I HATE rap! I HATE anything that has to do with it! I HATE the culture that spawns it! That isn't to say this was a rap movie. It wasn't. But, it had enough in it that I nearly puked. And, the whole idea of an almost all white school becoming almost all rap-oriented was ludicrous.

I don't like English movies all that well either. I can't understand what they are saying some of the time and it is, frankly, too much work to try to listen. I want to be spoon-fed when it comes to movies. I'm paying to be spoon-fed - if not with money, then time. No subtitles, no heavy accents, no complicated plots, no multiple names that require memorization. Spoon-fed.

Oh, and I almost forgot, it is supposedly a comedy, which means, I presume, that you are supposedly supposed to laugh. The operative word being ""supposedly"".

All in all an incredibly easy movie to miss and a movie I will forget about just as soon as I click ""Now send my comments for approval""."

The Merchants of Disease no doubt are happy to reinforce in young minds that suave and cool guys (and gals too) smoke. I was disgusted.

*****

Hugh Grant brings to ""About a Boy"" depth to his role as a man with neither an employment history nor a need for one thanks to an inheritance. He proclaims with true insight that he is shallow and for much of the movie he demonstrates that quality. His interests are totally hedonistic when they are not simply lazy. Women are objectified for their sexual availability - he is amazed if they look for anything else in him.

Of course that state of affairs can't continue and through a bed partner-hunting machination he becomes acquainted with Fiona (Toni Collett) and her very smart but out-of-the-loop with his peers kid, Marcus. Credit is deserved for making Fiona, a single woman beyond the verge of a nervous breakdown, the unattractive and disturbed mess she is - there's no hint of glamour behind the neuroses, the usual cinematic depiction. Toni Collett is believable, moving.

No surprise that Will begins to discover, through Marcus, qualities he never thought he had in him. Actually, he never did. What is unfolded is the birth of a New Man. What saves the story from being pedestrian is that Grant goes beyond his earlier patented portrayals of the vulnerable and confused male to engage in real and believable character development. And his meeting Rachel (Rachel Weisz) has more reality to it than his earlier smooth but solely sex-directed hunting of beautiful women.

Marcus is more than a catalyst for grownup transformation - he learns from Will without viewing him as an infallible role model (which he surely ain't). Nicholas Hoult is wonderful in this role with shaded emotional nuances appropriate to both his unstable domestic life and the pressures any bright kid experiences at school when he's out of synch with the ""crowd.""

Two serious bothersome points. The first is that this story perpetuates the all-too-frequent movie story line about kids who choose to or feel they must undertake the role of helping their parents and other adults deal with very serious problems that are, in reality, never rightfully a child's burden. Marcus's maturity and commitment are admirable in the film but in reality a child in his situation probably wouldn't see a very happy resolution and might well feel responsibility for failing in his/her mission. In movies, of course, the kid usually succeeds. I can see kids from single parent homes watching this film and feeling either inspired to emulate Marcus or disturbed that they can't.

Secondly but connectedly, ""About a Boy"" trivializes serious mental illness. It isn't done intentionally but if people could overcome their dangerously real depression through just meeting new people and enjoying good food, a lot of doctors and therapists could close their practices and go to law school."
tt0276751,407,"I was quite sceptical to this, being a Hugh Grant film and all, but it was a delightful surprise. This movie is fresh and clean, and every scene feels air-conditioned. The script is excellent, every line fits well, and it's good to see that the one(s) behind it know how love begins, in contrary to the producers in Hollywood. The camera work is good. Some passages I have been looking for so much in other movies are being performed with ease here. The music fits very well. Rachel Weisz is acting good and well, unbelievable beautiful, one of the top five most beautiful women on screen ever if you ask me, without doubt.

So, no let-downs at all? I think the film should have been better off being more emotional. When you leave the cinema you don't remember it that passionately, it's rather flat. I am not sure Hugh Grant is that good at being emotional. And a few longer still scenes would perhaps have given the film more depth. But, it's also a comedy, and occasionally it's actually really funny.

tt0276751,408,"Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) has a fear of responsibility. Living off royalties from his father's aging cheesy Christmas song, he can live life to the full without having to worry about anything too much. But when Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) comes into his life through a bizarre twist of lies Will made up to get into a single parent's group, he is suddenly expected to become an adult, and help Marcus act like he used to - a kid.

Adapted from the equally, if not more impressive, bestselling novel by Nick Hornby, About A Boy is a hugely enjoyable film. Though by no means perfect, it is full of quick gags and wit that will liven up your night. Hugh Grant is a world away from the floppy-haired bloke that he was in Notting Hill, Four Weddings et al, and fits into his role as an irresponsible reckless womaniser surprisingly well. Definitely recommended."
